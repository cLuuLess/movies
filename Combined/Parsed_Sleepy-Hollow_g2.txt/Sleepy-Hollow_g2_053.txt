     ext.  windmill roof -- day

     ichabod and young masbath climb out a door to the roof.  the
     rotors spin nearby.  ichabod searches the countryside.

     below, many men are ride up the long straight road.

                             ichabod 
               what is it?

                             young masbath 
               it's payment day.  loan monies are
               given to baltus the last day each
               month.  almost everyone borrows...
               for tools or to hire workers.

     ichabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to
     masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl.

                             ichabod
                     (points) 
               out there.  what do you see?

                             young masbath 
               the western woods.

                             ichabod 
               look again.

     a plume of smoke rises from woods, far.

                             young masbath 
               smoke.  chimney smoke.

     ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point
     of a sewing needle against a small black rock.

                             ichabod 
               are you familiar with magnets?

                             young masbath 
               what kind of nuts?

                             ichabod 
               not for eating, i assure you.  watch
               here.

     ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  young masbath is
     amazed, reaching for it.  ichabod watches him play with it.

                             young masbath 
               it's spectacular.

                             ichabod
                     (smiles, pause) 
               yes... i suppose it is.  keep it.

                             young masbath 
               no, i couldn't...

                             ichabod 
               i have others.  all i need is this.

     ichabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of
     the straw.  young masbath studies the rock, pockets it.

                             young masbath 
               thank you.

                             ichabod
                     (nods, almost shy) 
               now, hold the bowl steady.  back to
               business.

     young masbath lifts the bowl.  ichabod drops in the
     needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like.

                             ichabod 
               if the western woods are truly the
               devil's glen, we will see for
               ourselves.

                             young masbath
                     (uneasy) 
               father said witches live there.

                             ichabod 
               witches do not exist.  however...

     ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle
     points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch.

                             ichabod 
               not long ago, i would have said the
               same for headless horseman.

                             katrina (o.s.)
               constable... !

     katrina's on horseback below, unhappy.

                             katrina 
               i need to speak with you.  alone.
