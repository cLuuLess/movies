     ext.  belltower field -- early evening

     the belltower is covered in defensive spikes.  a man climbs
     down a rope ladder.  below, many armed men gather.  everyone
     grim.  philipse moves to the center, on horseback.

                             philipse
               gather round!  gather and quiet!
               the hour has come to choose for
               this night.  each man's name is
               in this box and has been checked.

     a box is handed up.  ichabod and baltus arrive on foot at the
     back of the mob.  ichabod looks...

     at a nearby forest, men light torch posts in a line bordering
     the forest edge for at least a half mile.

     philipse draws a folded paper from the box, holds it up.

                             philipse
               may the lord watch over him...
                     (unfolds paper)
               "jonathan masbath."  are you here?

                             jonathan (o.s.)
               i am.  i take my responsibility.

     the crowd parts as jonathan masbath, a dirt-poor farmer with
     a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  his son, young
     masbath, 14, grips his arm.

                             young masbath
               no, father.  wait...
                     (up to philipse)
               he's already been up once.  why
               does he go again?

                             jonathan
               it is a lottery, son.  it just as
               easily might have been one of them.

                             young masbath
               then... i go with you.

                             jonathan
               no.  you obey my wishes.
                     (looks to crowd)
               brom.  look after him, will you?

     brom steps up, nodding.  jonathan kisses his son's cheek,
     then heads to the rope ladder.  men pat him on the back.

                             philipse
               someone leave him a horse.

     young masbath watches his father go.  brom coaxes him away.
     at the back of the crowd, ichabod watches skeptically, looks
     to young masbath as he and brom pass.

                             ichabod
               you worry for naught, little man.
               nothing will harm him there.
                     (looks up, sotto)
               it is problems here on the ground
               you people need begin to worry
               about.

     ichabod watches jonathan climb, very high above.
