     int.  church, steenwyck's quarters -- morning

     in the church: it's crowded with families.  pews filled with
     bedding and belongings.  steenwyck comes to close the double
     doors of his quarters, turning, angry.

                             father steenwyck 
               you are astonishing, constable.  do
               you truly think your ridiculous
               accusations frighten me?

     ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain.

                             ichabod 
               only if i repeat them outside this
               room.  and, i will if i must...
                     (points to doors) 
               out there, for all to hear.  or...
               you may speak, as planned.  but, you
               tell them you feel compelled to move
               on to greener pastures.

                             father steenwyck 
               no.  you will not run me out.  no one
               will believe a word of what you say.

                             ichabod 
               oh?  far as i can tell, a rumor does
               not travel alone for long here.

                             father steenwyck 
               are you a deist?  is that it?  a free
               thinker who does not believe in
               divinity.

                             ichabod 
               it is only important what you are.
               an adulterer...

                             father steenwyck 
               i am the lord's voice in this town.

                             ichabod
               wallowing in sin and lust...

                             father steenwyck 
               they need guidance.

                             ichabod 
               wallowing quite literally in blood.

                             father steenwyck 
                     (snapping, quaking) 
               damn you, sir!  god damn you to hell!

                             ichabod 
               he may.  but, not soon enough for
               you, and not on your behalf.

     ichabod walks.  steenwyck is humiliated.

                             ichabod 
               you are so upset now... and yet, you
               seemed in such good spirits last night.

                             father steenwyck 
               you cannot do this.  i am a man of god!

                             ichabod 
               climb to the top of the tallest ladder
               you can find, father.  that is the
               closest you ever come to god.
