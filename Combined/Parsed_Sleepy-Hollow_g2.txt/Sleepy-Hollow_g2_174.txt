     int.  doctor's residence, medical room -- night

     ichabod enters.  there are two coffins on the floor.

                             ichabod
               i never examined these bodies.

     ichabod removes the lid from one coffin.  lancaster is about
     to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted.

                             doctor lancaster
               ... help yourself, you pompous ass.
               i will be in bed.

                             ichabod
               would you stay, doctor?  i may need
               assistance.

     lancaster reluctantly remains.  ichabod stares at the dead
     lady van tassel.  the neck wound is covered by a stained
     brown cloth, which ichabod unwraps.

                             ichabod
               stains of blood.

                             doctor lancaster
               what of it?

     ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the
     magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck.

                             ichabod
               jagged flesh. 
                     (pause)
               the horseman did not do this.

     ichabod moves to the side of the coffin, lifting the hand
     with the stitched gash on its palm.

                             ichabod
               here, doctor.  hold this just so...

     lancaster holds the lens so that ichabod can study the cut
     through it.  ichabod takes a scalpel-like knife from his
     satchel, lifts the hand and cuts stitches.

     through the lens: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless.

                             ichabod 
               no clotting or gathering of pus.  no
               healing at all.

                             doctor lancaster 
               what?

                             ichabod 
               when this cut was made, this person
               was already dead.
                     (stands straight)
               this is not lady van tassel.
