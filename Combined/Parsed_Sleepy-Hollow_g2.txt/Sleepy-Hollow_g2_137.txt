     ext.  van tassel house front porch -- morning

     baltus leads ichabod to the porch.

                             baltus 
               clergyman steenwyck is calling a
               meeting.  this time he is determined
               to have you forced out, or worse.

                             ichabod 
               how did you hear this?

                             baltus
               he came to me.  he promised great
               violence.  said i should cast you out
               for my own protection.
                     (troubled pause)
               i must speak honestly.  there is no
               reason to think he will not meet with
               success.

     ichabod looks to barn, sees masbath bringing the horses.  the
     church bell is heard tolling far away.

                             baltus 
               that is the meeting bell already
               calling.  with the murder of killian
               and brom, no one sees any good from
               you.  if... if you were to leave...
               you might be saving your own life.

     ichabod studies baltus, then offers his hand.  they shake.

                             ichabod 
               i appreciate your concern.  i thank
               you, sir.

     ichabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  he runs.
     masbath runs to him.  ichabod takes gunpowder and climbs up.

                             young masbath
                     (mounting his horse) 
               what now?  where is she?

                             ichabod 
               things have become complicated.
               katrina is at the mill.  ride ahead,
               find her and bring her to meet me
               outside the church.  find her at all
               costs.  quickly.

     they ride, fast.
