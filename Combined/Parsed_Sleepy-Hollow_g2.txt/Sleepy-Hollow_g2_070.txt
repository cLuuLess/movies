     int.  doctor's residence, parlor -- night

     doctor lancaster wrings his hands.  his wife rocks nervously
     in a rocking chair.  the crowd outside roars as a bonfire
     lights up the curtained windows.

     the front door is pounded open.  angry men enter.  lancaster
     stands, lips quivering.  he points insistently to a door.
