     ext.  western woods, burial ground -- night

     hoofbeats.  the horseman enters the clearing, keeping a hand
     on lady van tassel.  ahead, the twisted tree awaits.

     lady van tassel is awakening, face bloody.  she turns her
     head and looks forward.  she screams.

     the twisted tree's wound opens, wide and glowing.

     daredevil picks up speed...

     daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
     striking the horseman.

     for an instant, horseman and horse are transformed, skeletons
     of light, entering the tree.

     silence and smoke.  at the tree, lady van tassel's hand
     sticks out from the tight-shut suture.

     the sewn wound on her palm seeps blood.
