     int.  notary public, hardenbrook's offices -- day

     tidy room.  young masbath watches ichabod hand a slip of
     paper to the elderly notary, hardenbrook.

                             ichabod
               do you have these persons' wills?

                             hardenbrook
               i have everything... last testaments...
               birth certificates, death certificates...
               deeds.

                             ichabod
               yes, sir... but, do you have these?

     hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye.

                             hardenbrook
               certainly... certainly.

     hardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  ichabod
     stands waiting.  hardenbrook is still nodding.

                             ichabod
               may i see them, master hardenbrook?

                             hardenbrook
               hmm?  see them?

                             ichabod
               may we look at them now?

                             hardenbrook 
               of course.  you want them... it shall
               not take long.  wait here.

     hardenbrook heads across the room.  ichabod offers the list.

                             ichabod
               maybe you should take this.

                             hardenbrook 
               a fine idea.

     hardenbrook takes it and exits.  young masbath sits.

                             young masbath 
               what good is this?

                             ichabod 
               to discover what might have been taken
               from those who died, it will help to
               know what was there that could be
               taken in the first place.

     ichabod waits.  after a moment, he looks uncertain.  he
     crosses to the half-open door...
