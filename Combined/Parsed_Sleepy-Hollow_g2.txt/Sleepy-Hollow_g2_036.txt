     int.  doctor's residence, medical room -- morning

     scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  there's an inch-long
     wound on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.

     ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  lancaster watches,
     anxiously mopping his face.  young masbath's in a corner.
     ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.

                             ichabod 
               what is the common thread between
               these victims?

                             young masbath 
               i'm sure i don't know.

                             ichabod 
               we must discover it.  the reason the
               murderer chose these persons.

     ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.

                             ichabod 
               the wounds are the same.  cauterized.
               no chopping or half-measures either.
               one stroke took the head.  have you
               seen, doctor... ?
                     (pointing to it) 
               even the spinal bone... sliced as
               smooth as butter.

                             doctor lancaster 
               i do not care.  you are welcome to
               use my work area, but i beg you...
               return her to her resting place.

                             ichabod 
               in time, doctor.  soon as i finish.

     ichabod picks up an iron knife.  he looks to young masbath.

                             ichabod 
               you should step outside.
