     ext.  forest -- day

     dawn.  ichabod is seated overlooking the hudson.  he stares
     at the beauty around him, brooding through bleary eyes.
     gunpowder is tied to a tree.  birds sing.

     the ledger is open in ichabod's lap.  he thumbs pages
     absently, just keeps staring off.
