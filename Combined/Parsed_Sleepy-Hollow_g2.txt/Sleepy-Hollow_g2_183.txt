     lady van tassel admires the skull.

                             lady van tassel  
                     (mock sorrow) 
               woe is me... that spying on my husband
               in his filthy indiscretion, i saw he
               and sarah attacked by the horseman.
               oh pity me... so overcome was i that
               i wandered in the western woods...
               dazed... nearly blind from terror.

     lady van tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face.

                             lady van tassel 
               and, tomorrow is my grand performance,
               having barely survived the elements...
                     (more emoting) 
               by sheer luck i found my way back to
               the hollow.  but... what do i find
               here... ?  my dear, sweet step-daughter
               katrina is dead.  why has god forsaken
               her?

     seeing that lady van tassel lavish attention on katrina,
     masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees.

                             lady van tassel
                     (of herself, pleased) 
               no one will suspect this sad woman who
               has been through such an ordeal.  with
               only the empty solace of her money and
               land to comfort her.
