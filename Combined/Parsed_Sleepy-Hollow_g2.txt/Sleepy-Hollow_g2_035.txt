     ext.  churchyard and cemetery -- later morning (time cut)

     a psalm is heard read by steenwyck o.s. while a coffin is
     exhumed.  ichabod guides the lifting.  the coffin is put near
     the headstone "windsor."  ichabod looks...

     at the church, steenwyck faces about fifty people who now
     take up the prayer.

     across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are
     pried open.  "van garrett, 1799."  killian leads the effort
     with young masbath's aid...

     the lids come off, revealing the headless bodies of a man and
     a little boy.  young masbath backs away.

     at the "windsor" coffin, nails creak as ichabod opens the
     lid.  we do not see inside, but when ichabod does, he is
     aghast.  he looks to the men, angry.

                             ichabod
               why was i not told of this?

     no answer.  killian arrives, nods solemnly.

                             killian 
               the widow windsor.

                             ichabod 
               is that all you say?  look at her.

                             killian 
               it's not something people speak of
               openly.  she did not remarry.

     ichabod kneels, studying.  now, we see: the belly of the
     headless corpse is bulbous, because the widow windsor was
     very far along in a pregnancy.

     ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  he
     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.

     he straightens, greatly troubled.
