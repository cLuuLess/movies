     ext.  town square -- night

     angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire.  the mob
     makes way.  steenwyck cheers them.

                             father steenwyck
               let her burn!  let her burn!

     ichabod comes out, followed by young masbath.  the crone's
     corpse is thrown in the fire.  cheers all around.

     at ichabod's side, a man tries to grab the ledger young
     masbath holds.  young masbath cries out, hanging on to the
     book.  ichabod joins the struggle.

     katrina watches, emotions conflicting.

     other men grab ichabod.  one punches ichabod in the face.

     katrina rides forward as baltus calls for her to stop.

     katrina leaps down, into the crowd, pulls men off ichabod.

                             katrina
               stop this!  leave them alone!

     a shot rings out.  chaos halts.  everyone turns, quieting.

     the men around masbath and ichabod turn to face brom bones.
     brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by theodore and glenn.

                             brom 
               let them go
                     (pointing) 
               are you going to beat an orphaned
               child, imbecile?

     masbath is released, along with the ledger.  steenwyck moves
     forward, pushing people aside.

                             father steenwyck 
               are you ichabod crane's protector,
               brom bones?

                             brom 
               only for the moment.

                             father steenwyck 
               you side with him in this?

                             brom 
               no.  i agree he has only made matters
               worse.  but, that will change, if you
               listen.

     he trades with theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  brom hefts
     the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket.

                             brom 
               theodore, glenn and i offer to ride
               each day and night to watch over the
               hollow.  we will stalk the border of
               the western woods and haunt the
               horseman for a change, with rifles
               like this... and slugs like this...

     brom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  it whistles.

                             brom 
               hollowed out and filled with powder.

     brom smiles at katrina, who watches unimpressed.

                             brom 
               constable crane is not the only one
               who fights with science on his side.

                             ichabod 
               i fired upon the horseman and the
               bullet did nothing.

                             brom 
               you must have missed your mark.

                             ichabod 
               i hit him square.

                             brom
                     (to the crowd) 
               i say... if the horseman is solid
               enough to take the lives of our
               people, he's solid enough to feel
               this...

     brom aims the rifle at a barrel down the road.  fires.

     plunk -- the barrel is hit -- explodes.  smoke wafts.
