     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     ichabod and masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  ichabod
     takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  midnight,
     straight up.  ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.

                             ichabod
               midnight seems an appropriate time.
