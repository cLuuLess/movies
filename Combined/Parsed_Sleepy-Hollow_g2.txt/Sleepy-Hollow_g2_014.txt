     int.  van tassel manor house, sitting room -- day

     many children, in a circle, taunt a blindfolded young woman
     spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, brom van
     brunt.  a few young men and ladies watch.  brom releases the
     woman.  everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

                             blindfolded woman
               this is such a silly game.

                             brom
               be a sport and stop complaining.

     the woman moves to brom's voice.  he backs away, flanked by
     peers glenn and theodore.  children laugh.

     ichabod enters, clearing his throat.  no one notices.  the
     blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  one little girl sees
     ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips.

                             little girl
               play along.  you must.

     she tugs him.  before ichabod can protest, he is placed in
     the blindfolded woman's grip.

                             blindfolded woman
               there, i have someone.  am i
               finished?

                             little girl
               you have to tell who it is.

     the woman touches ichabod's face.  he is uncomfortable,
     affected by this caress.  brom watches jealously.

                             little girl
               at least make a guess.

                             blindfolded woman
               i don't know.  is it brom bones?

                             brom
               certainly not.

                             ichabod
               excuse me, miss...
                     (takes her hands)
               they have a laugh at your expense.

     she takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty:
     katrina van tassel.  ichabod tries to compose himself.

                             katrina
               forgive me, i didn't know.

                             ichabod
               i... i am looking for baltus van
               tassel.

                             brom
               we haven't heard your name yet,
               friend.

                             ichabod
               well, unless your name is baltus,
               you should not worry over mine.

     brom grabs ichabod's collar, pissed.  ichabod's baffled.

                             brom
               you need some manners.

                             katrina
               brom!

     brom looks at her, then reluctantly releases ichabod.

                             man's voice (o.s.)
               what is this, then... ?

     baltus van tassel, 45, has entered, a working-class
     aristocrat.  lady van tassel, 40, stands behind, a mix of
     home-spun wife and well-kept lady.

                             baltus
               can i help you, sir?

     ichabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  children
     gather around katrina and hide behind her.

                             ichabod
               i have been sent from the city
               with a letter of introduction.
               i am told you offer me room and
               board.

     ichabod hands over papers.  baltus reads, furrows his brow.

                             ichabod
               if we could speak alone.

                             baltus
                     (nods, looks to katrina)
               this is not a time for frivolity,
               katrina, is it?  am i mistaken?

                             katrina
               they're only children, father.

     baltus snorts, then exits with ichabod.  the others huddle to
     gossip, except katrina, who moves beside lady van tassel to
     watch ichabod and baltus walk down the hall.
