     ext.  town square, doctor's residence -- night

     much commotion.  a mob in front of the home marked
     "lancaster, physician."  steenwyck addresses the rabble.

                             father steenwyck 
               you all stand idle, while this man
               goes about with a book of secrets and
               a bag filled with magic.  you all
               stand idle, while the shadow of the
               devil falls over our town.

     baltus, lady van tassel and katrina watch at safe distance.

                             father steenwyck 
               i say, if you do nothing, you share
               in the blasphemy of ichabod crane!

     killian, on horseback beside his wife, beth, and son, thomas,
     rides to one side of the shouting crowd.

                             killian 
               listen to me!  do you want to save
               your crops?  or would you rather see
               your farms go to ruin?

                             father steenwyck 
               how is he saving our farms?  how?
               ichabod crane has brought into our
               midst the soulless, moldering corpse
               of a heretic!
