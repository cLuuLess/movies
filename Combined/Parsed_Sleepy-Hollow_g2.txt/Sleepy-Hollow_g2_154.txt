     int.  sleepy hollow forests -- day

     the storm has passed.  empty forest.  long, peaceful pause,
     till ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground.

     ichabod comes to look down a small hill.  the corpse of lady
     van tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress.

     ichabod walks to the body.  lady van tassel's arm is twisted
     behind.  the sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.

                             ichabod
                     (shouting back)
               here!  i have found her...
                     (looking at corpse,
                      quiet and miserable)
               here she is.
