     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- morning

     ichabod's hurting.  masbath helps with a shirt.

                             young masbath
               someone left last night.  looked
               like they headed to the square, but
               i lost them in the forest.

                             ichabod 
               man or woman?

                             young masbath 
               all i saw was their lantern.

                             ichabod 
               business, best hidden is hidden best
               at night.

     ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.

                             young masbath
               if someone has the horseman's skull...
               if they control the horseman, then why
               haven't they sent him for your head
               yet?

                             ichabod 
               because, i serve a fine purpose alive.
               it is perfection for our murderer if i
               return to new york city with nothing
               more than tales of a galloping ghoul. 
                     (pause) 
               we must uncover the reason these
               victims were targeted.  what was taken
               from them... other than their lives?
               who benefits by their deaths?

     ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder.

     it bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.

                             ichabod 
               damn it.

     ichabod kneels, pained.  a trail of the blood-detecting
     powder has spilled.  the bottle is out of reach.

                             young masbath 
               i'll get it.

     young masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but ichabod
     stops him, peering under.

                             ichabod
               wait...

     far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling.

     ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. 
     young masbath helps. they drag the bed to one side.

     under the bed: a satanic pentagram has been drawn in blood.

     ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  masbath is
     about to speak, but ichabod puts a finger to his lips.

     ichabod moves to lock the door.

                             young masbath 
                     (whispers) 
               who did this?

     ichabod does not answer.  he picks up a wash basin and dumps
     the water to wash the pentagram away.
