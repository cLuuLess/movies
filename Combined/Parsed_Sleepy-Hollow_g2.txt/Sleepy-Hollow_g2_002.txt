     ext.  city streets -- night

     empty cobblestone streets.  crooked buildings.  a rapidly
     clanging bell breaks the silence from afar.

     insert title:  new york city

     two constables clamor round a corner, lanterns held high,
     listening.  they rush into an alleyway.

     elsewhere, piers border the hudson river.  the bell is
     louder. the two constables arrive, searching.  no one around.
     constable one hefts his pistol, scared.

                             constable one
               where are you?!

                             man's voice (o.s.)
               here!  over here!

     they hurry to the river's edge.  down a hill, the man,
     another constable, stands with his back to us.  he's waist
     deep in water, tossing away his alarm bell.

                             man
               i need your help with this.

     constable two crosses on the peir above.  constable one moves
     forward, wary.  the man grunts, lifting something.

                             constable one
               constable crane?  ichabod crane...
               is that you?

     the man turns.  meet ichabod crane, handsome, eyes piercing.

                             ichabod
               yes, it is me.  but, not only me...
                     (lifting, struggling)
               i found someone here...

     he drags a bloated male corpse up from the murky water.

                             ichabod
               someone quite dead.
