     ext.  new york city street, ichabod's home -- day

     a bright, busy day in new york.  a coach pulls up to
     ichabod's home.  ichabod is the driver.  he gets off, goes
     and opens the coach door.  he helps katrina down.  next,
     young masbath sticks his head out.

     ichabod goes about unloading bags.  katrina holds young
     masbath's hand, and they look down the street in wonder.
