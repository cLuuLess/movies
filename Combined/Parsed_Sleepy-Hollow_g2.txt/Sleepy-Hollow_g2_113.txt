     ext.  van tassel estate, orchard -- night

     the lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the
     house.  we cannot make out the person.

     elsewhere, young masbath runs in pursuit.  he hides against
     one tree, leans to look...

     the light enters forest.  young masbath follows.
