     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     candlelight.  ichabod, shirtless, feverish, opens his eyes.
     the wound at the top of his chest is raw.  katrina inserts a
     needle in the skin around it.

                             katrina
               lay still, ichabod.  do not move.

                             lady van tassel
               doctor, he is awake.

     ichabod tries to sit.  pain stops him.  lady van tassel helps
     bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a
     suction jar of blood.

                             ichabod
                     (barely a voice)
               what... what are you doing... ?

                             katrina
               i'm drawing bad blood from the wound.

     doctor lancaster comes to the bed.

                             doctor lancaster
               keep still, constable.  you were
               half-drowned when they found you.

                             ichabod
               ... brom bones...

                             doctor lancaster
               he is dead.  you would be also, if
               your wound had not somehow shut.

                             ichabod
               bring young masbath here.

                             doctor lancaster
               you need to sleep.

                             ichabod
               bring him.

                             doctor lancaster
               you need rest.

     ichabod gives up, closes his eyes.  katrina, needle in one
     hand, brings her other hand to hold ichabod's.

     blood drips into the suction jar.
