     ext.  van tassel house -- night

     ... tolls.  ichabod bounds out to the lawn, halting to
     listen.  katrina and baltus come out on the porch.

                             baltus
               constable, where are you going!?

     ... tolls... tolls... then, silence.  ichabod chases away.

                             baltus
               come back, sir...
                     (watches him go)
               madness.

     baltus ushers katrina back in.  the door slams.
