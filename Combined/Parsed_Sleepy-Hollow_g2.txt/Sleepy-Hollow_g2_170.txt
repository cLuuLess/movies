     int.  ichabod's coach -- night

     ichabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it.

     the paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird
     appears to be inside the cage.

     ichabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window.

     a tear rolls down his cheek.

     the bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops.

     ichabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans
     forward to the window at front.

     outside the coach

     ichabod's face appears behind van ripper.

                             ichabod
               van ripper, turn the coach about!

                             van ripper
               what did you say?

                             ichabod
               turn around.  now!
