     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- later night

     ichabod is soundly asleep.  across the room, katrina is at
     his work table.  ichabod stirs.  katrina looks to him.

     once she is satisfied he will not wake, she returns to what
     she was doing, turning a page.  she is reading his ledger.
