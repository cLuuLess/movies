     ext.  van tassel house, front porch -- morning

     rain.  ichabod comes out.  across the lawn, young masbath is
     bringing the horses.

                             lady van tassel (o.s.) 
               good morrow, constable.

     ichabod turns to see lady van tassel in a chair, sewing.

                             lady van tassel 
               returning to the western woods?

                             ichabod 
               yes, actually.

                             lady van tassel 
               use caution.

                             ichabod
                     (nods, studies her) 
               do you know... i think those are the
               first words i have heard from you my
               entire time here.

                             lady van tassel 
               as my husband says, a wife should be
               always like an echo, and at the same
               time, quite unlike an echo.
                     (off ichabod's confusion) 
               like an echo, she should speak only
               when spoken to, and unlike an echo,
               should never try to have the last
               word, or, at least that is what he
               believes.

     baltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand.

                             baltus 
               constable... did you notice anything
               out of the ordinary during the night?

     ichabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be.

                             ichabod 
               um... i... i did not... no.  why?

                             baltus 
               sarah has gone missing... my servant
               girl.  her things are gone.  damn it.
               she has joined the migration out of
               town.
                     (to lady van tassel) 
               what about breakfast, woman?  or, am
               i to starve to death?

     lady van tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet.

                             ichabod 
               i should be going... good day to you.

     ichabod heads towards young masbath.  baltus watches from the
     porch, disgruntled.  he goes in.
