     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     ichabod packs up baggage.  young masbath is miserable.

                             young masbath 
               won't you change your mind, sir?
               what can i say to convince you?

                             ichabod 
               nothing.  to hell with this place
               and all the people here.

     ichabod closes a bag, throws it with others.

                             young masbath 
               why... why are you like this?

                             ichabod
                     (pause, softening) 
               you do not know all that has happened.
                     (pause) 
               you cannot understand.
