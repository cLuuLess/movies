     int.  windmill -- night

     katrina looks down from the stairs.

     the horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.

                             katrina
               ichabod...

                             ichabod
               keep climbing.  i will follow...

     ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of
     the milling platform.

                             ichabod
                     (under his breath) 
               hopefully.

     above, young masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the
     door to the roof.

     below, ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled
     grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.

     he grabs one open bag and dumps it.  more grain dust.
