     ext.  windmill roof -- night

     ichabod shepherds katrina and young masbath to the edge where
     the rotors spin close.

                             ichabod 
               the blades will carry us to the ground.
               face front and wait for me.

                             katrina 
               i... i can't do this.

                             ichabod 
               we have no choice.

     ichabod moves back to the trap door.

     katrina and young masbath look at the rotors, and down at the
     long distance between them and the ground.

                             ichabod 
               be ready...

     ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.

                             ichabod
               now!
