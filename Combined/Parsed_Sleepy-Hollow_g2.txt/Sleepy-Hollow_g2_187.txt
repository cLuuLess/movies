     ext.  forest -- night

     katrina and young masbath run out from a line of trees.

                             katrina 
               ichabod!

                             young masbath
               here we are!

     behind in the forest, lady van tassel rides her white horse,
     in no hurry.  wind kicks hard.  hoofbeats are heard.

                             lady van tassel 
               run, katrina!  fast as your pretty
               legs will carry you.  it makes no
               difference.

     on the lawn, ichabod drives towards katrina and masbath.

     behind, at the tree line, lady van tassel holds up the
     horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

                             lady van tassel 
               nothing will stop him now!

     at mid-field, ichabod reaches katrina and masbath.

                             ichabod
               climb up!

                             young masbath
               lady van tassel...

                             ichabod
               i know.  hold on.

     with katrina and masbath on board, ichabod turns the coach.
     katrina unties masbath's hands.  hoofbeats get louder.

                             lady van tassel
               olly-olly oxen-free!

     ichabod looks back towards lady van tassel.

     at the treeline, the horseman breaks into the open, hell on
     horseback.  full speed ahead.

                             ichabod
               christ.
