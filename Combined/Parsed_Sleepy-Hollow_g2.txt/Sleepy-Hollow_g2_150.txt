     int.  church -- day

     the huge farmer shoves baltus to the floor again.

                             huge farmer
               get out!

     others join the rage, pulling baltus towards the front of the
     church, shouting.  ichabod struggles to push them off.

                             ichabod 
               stop this!

     ichabod gets to baltus' side, trying to protect.

                             ichabod 
               the horseman cannot enter!  it does
               not matter who he wants, he cannot
               cross the gate!

     at the windows, one rifleman turns, crying out.

                             one rifleman 
               he's coming back!

     more panic.  the huge farmer moves towards baltus.

                             huge farmer 
               we have to save ourselves!

     baltus pulls the pistol from ichabod's holster, brandishing.

                             baltus 
               no!  get away from me!
