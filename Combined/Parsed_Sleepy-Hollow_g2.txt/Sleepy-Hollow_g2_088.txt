     ext.  forests -- day

     a black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  thunder is
     heard.  the horse slows and stops... it is brom's horse, with
     brom aboard.  brom looks skyward.

     the storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  distant
     hoofbeats can be heard.  pounding.

     brom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  the hoofbeats grow
     louder and pass, far away.  brom turns in the saddle and
     whistles.  he kicks his horse and rides.
