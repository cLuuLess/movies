     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     katrina enters.  ichabod sits at his work table.

                             katrina
               are you hungry?

     ichabod shakes his head, won't look up.  katrina crosses.

     she begins picking up pieces of the plaster hoofprint cast
     which lies shattered on the floor.

                             katrina
               you promised justice.

                             ichabod
               if these are the random stalkings of
               a monster, what good am i?

                             katrina
               people have put their trust in you.

                             ichabod 
               they have done nothing of the sort.

                             katrina
               won't they still have that justice?
                     (patience waning)
               or, was it a vain promise?

     ichabod stews, head in his hands.  someone is heard
     running... young masbath enters, frightened.

                             young masbath
               constable crane... something has
               happened.
