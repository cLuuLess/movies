     ext.  van tassel estate -- night

     a coach, with gunpowder as one of its team, waits in the
     orchard.  van ripper comes to meet ichabod and masbath.

                             ichabod 
               half now.  half when we reach the
               city.

     ichabod hands van ripper money.  van ripper takes the
     baggage.  ichabod looks to the manor house.  only one light
     shines, in a second floor window.

     katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains.

     ichabod turns to young masbath, who is beginning to cry.

                             ichabod 
               this is farewell.

                             young masbath 
               take me with you.  there's nothing
               left for me here.

                             ichabod 
               i cannot.
                     (bends to masbath) 
               you should not worry.
                     (pause, sorrow) 
               van ripper and his wife will look
               after you.  they will.  you will be
               well cared for.

     young masbath hugs.  ichabod hugs back, swallowing.

                             ichabod
               i am sorry.
                     (quietly) 
               forgive me.  i failed you.

     ichabod releases and goes quickly away, finding this misery
     unbearable.  he climbs in the coach.

                             young masbath 
               do not go, constable.  how can you
               leave?

     inside the coach, ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes
     his eyes.  he pounds twice on the coach wall.

     outside, van ripper whips the reins.  the coach starts.
     young masbath follows.  the coach picks up speed on the long
     straight road.

     young masbath stops, wiping tears.
