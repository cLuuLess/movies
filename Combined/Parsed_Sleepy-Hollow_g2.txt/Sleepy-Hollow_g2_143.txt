     ext.  church -- day

     storming.  the meeting is letting out.  near the churchyard
     gate, young masbath rides with katrina following on a horse
     cart.  ichabod walks up as katrina dismounts.

                             katrina 
               what is so urgent?

                             ichabod 
               come with me.

     ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.

                             katrina 
               why have i not seen your face for so
               long?  you look much better.

     she touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan
     agreements there.

                             ichabod 
               explain these.  i found them secreted
               away in the sewing room.

     katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

                             ichabod 
               why... why have i scrambled and run
               and clawed in all directions, only to
               find you against me?

     he stares at her.  katrina stares back, in a small way
     defeated.  she looks for an out, but there is none.

                             katrina
               i have been reading your journal.
               i'm sorry.  i found it too fascinating
               to resist. 
                     (pause, ashamed) 
               i rode to catch up with you at the
               notary, out of curiosity.  before i
               found you though, i overheard what you
               were said.

                             ichabod 
               it was you there?

                             katrina 
               when... when you spoke father's name
               along with accusations, i could not
               believe it.  i had to hide these... at
               least till i could confront him myself.

                             ichabod 
               and, what did he say?

                             katrina 
               he did not do these things.  if you
               knew him, you would realize...

                             ichabod 
               what did he say, katrina?

                             katrina 
               i have not been able to face him yet.

                             ichabod 
               the loans give the land to your father.
               it does not matter survivors are still
               on their farms.  they could be thrown
               off... tomorrow... a year from now.

                             katrina 
               yes, i have seen that, and i told you
               why i hid them.

                             ichabod 
               what would you have me believe?

                             katrina
                     (tiring, angry) 
               if you think i am behind this, say it.

                             ichabod 
               the name van tassel is blackened.  you
               share that name.

                             katrina 
               call me a liar, then, and a murderess.
               say it, out and out.

     many people are starting to notice the confrontation.

                             ichabod 
               katrina...

                             katrina 
               speak the words, constable.  what is
               stopping you?  what has happened to your
               ability to transcend sentimentality?

     emotions tear at him.  rain seems to pound down harder.

                             katrina 
               oh, no.  no.  please... don't dare stand
               looking as if you still care for me,
               after all that you have said.  if i were
               to confess, would that ease your
               suffering?  would that make it easier
               for you to hate me?!

     a tortured cry is heard o.s.

     baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.

                             baltus
               the horseman is coming!

     he's barely hanging on.  he stops, practically falling off,
     running towards katrina and ichabod.

                             baltus
               save me...

                             katrina
               father?

                             baltus
               he killed her...

     baltus grasps katrina, fearful.  hoofbeats are heard.

                             baltus
               the horseman has killed her.

     far behind, the horseman rides to follow, axe held up.
     instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming.

     baltus runs headlong to the church.

                             katrina
               father!

     katrina runs after baltus.  ichabod backs away, watching the
     horseman come, then heads to the church with masbath.

     baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining
     the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church.

     the horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  men, women and
     children run for cover all along the square.

     amidst the churchyard panic, ichabod looks back...

     the horseman reaches the open gate and daredevil suddenly
     rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter.

     the horseman grabs daredevil's reins, tries to move forward
     again.  same result.  daredevil freaks out.
