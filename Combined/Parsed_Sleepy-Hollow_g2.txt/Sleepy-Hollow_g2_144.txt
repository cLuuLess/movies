     int.  church -- day

     baltus makes his way in, shoving.  people are still clamoring
     in through the doors.

     men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at
     boarded windows.  women herd children into a cellar.

     baltus searches for a hiding place.  he looks across the
     church to see steenwyck closing the doors of his living
     quarters.  baltus moves...

                             baltus 
               steenwyck!

     at the front doors, katrina squeezes in with ichabod and
     young masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed.
     it's madness.  people outside begin pounding.

     katrina searches.

                             katrina 
               father!

     ichabod goes to a window, looking out between boards.
