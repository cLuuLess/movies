     int.  van tassel house, hallway -- night

     ichabod and young masbath look out, cautious.  they move to
     the nearest door.

     ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the
     door and door frame.  he's making a low, wax seal.  if the
     door opens, the seal will break.

     they move to a second door, quietly.  ichabod makes another
     low wax mark.
