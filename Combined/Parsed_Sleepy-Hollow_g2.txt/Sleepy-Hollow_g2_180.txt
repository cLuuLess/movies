     ext.  forest -- night

     katrina sits up, groggy.  lady van tassel looks down at her.

                             katrina 
               you... you are alive.

                             lady van tassel 
               am i?  or, are you and young masbath
               dead along with me?

     katrina sees young masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.

                             young masbath 
               she commands the horseman.

                             lady van tassel 
               and, quite beautifully done, wouldn't
               you say?  it is almost over.

     thunder again.  wind starts to pick up.

                             lady van tassel 
                     (of the wind) 
               he rides tonight.

                             katrina 
               father saw you die.

                             lady van tassel 
               he saw me thrown... saw the horseman
               looming over me as i fled.  things i
               wanted him to see.  but, as long as
               i govern the horseman, he cannot harm
               me.  baltus did not stay enough to
               see that.  he ran as a coward,
               unfettered by my fate.

                             young masbath 
               then, whose body was it... ?

                             lady van tassel 
               the precious servant girl sarah.  i
               killed her and kept her body hidden,
               till i needed it.  and, when i
               return to the hollow tomorrow, my
               version of the truth will come to
               pass. 
                     (faking meekness) 
               i mean, there i was that fateful day,
               following baltus into the woods.  i
               did not know what he was up to...
               where he was going.  i worried for
               his safety.

     katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself
     with, feels a rock and clutches it.

                             lady van tassel 
               imagine my surprise, finding him on a
               liason with a common servant.  a girl
               who had apparently become his secret
               love.

                             katrina 
               no one will believe your lies, whore.

                             lady van tassel 
               this whore will see your mouth shut
               forever very soon.  but... i am not
               going to kill you.  not me...

     she picks up the horseman's skull in her gloved hand.

                             lady van tassel 
               he will have that honor.
