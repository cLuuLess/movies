     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     young masbath unlocks the door.  ichabod enters.

                             young masbath
               i was getting worried.  who was it?

                             ichabod 
               lady van tassel.

                             young masbath 
               what was she doing?

                             ichabod 
               something i really wish i had not seen.
               never mind it.  did you find the
               victims' loan agreements?

                             young masbath 
               no.  they are all missing.

     this troubles ichabod.

                             young masbath 
               there is more, though.  while you were
               gone, i could hear someone else
               walking through the house.
