     ext.  western woods, tree of the dead -- night

     ichabod stands holding a torch, looking up.  the whole area
     is bright from the light off a giant fire.

     there are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized,
     twisted tree.  the tree is aflame, fire dancing up the trunk,
     and through every branch to lick the sky.
