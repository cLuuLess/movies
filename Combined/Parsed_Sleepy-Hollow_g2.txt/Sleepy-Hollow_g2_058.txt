     ext.  western woods, further on -- later day

     ichabod and masbath reach a hill crest.  they stop, uneasy.
     below: a cave with a rock archway.  an ill-fitting door
     covers the mouth.  the chimney spews smoke.

                             ichabod
               we have apparently arrived.
