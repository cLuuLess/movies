     ext.  churchyard cemetery -- early evening

     ichabod and others restore graves.  ichabod looks to the
     church, where clergyman steenwyck stands in the door.

                             father steenwyck
               the devil sent you, ichabod crane.
               the lord will not forgive your sins.

     steenwyck shuts the creaky doors.
