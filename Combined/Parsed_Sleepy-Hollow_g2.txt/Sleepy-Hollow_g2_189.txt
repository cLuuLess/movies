     ext. windmill field -- night

     ichabod, katrina and young masbath book into this open area,
     heading to the windmill.  another horrible squeal echoes.

     ichabod looks over his shoulder.

     heavy, low hanging branches and vines at the forest edge
     creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel.

                             ichabod 
               he's coming!

     the horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake.

                             ichabod 
               hurry!

     the horseman readies a battle axe.

     ichabod gets under the windmill, helping young masbath up the
     ladder and in.  katrina next.

     the horseman is almost there.

     ichabod follows katrina.  he gets in, feet dangling.  the
     horseman dismounts...
