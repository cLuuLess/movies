     int.  windmill -- day

     ichabod and young masbath enter via a ladder from the
     underbelly.  gears and counter wheels turn millstones.  a few
     men work in the grain powder filled air.

     ichabod leads the way to a staircase, up twists and turns.

                             young masbath
               where are we going?

                             ichabod 
               up.
