     ext.  western woods, further on -- early evening

     no rain.  dark.  a lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as
     ichabod and young masbath ride.

                             young masbath 
               follow the indian trail to where the
               sun dies.  to the tree of the dead. 
                     (looking back) 
               maybe we passed it by.

                             ichabod 
               how could something named "the tree
               of the dead" fail to draw attention?

     a bird cries out.  ichabod's startled, looking up.  the bird
     is heard alighting.  leaves float downwards.

                             ichabod 
               we should not go much further in
               this murk.

                             young masbath 
               should we go back?

                             ichabod 
               we are far from the hollow. 
                     (dismounts, troubled) 
               loath to say it... better to get our
               backs against a tree and stay till
               morning.
