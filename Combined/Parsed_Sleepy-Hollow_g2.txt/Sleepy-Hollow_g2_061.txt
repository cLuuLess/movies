     int.  cave home, lower cave -- day

     the old crone comes through a passage in the wet walls.
     ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.

                             old crone
               i hear him.  he rides to the hollow
               and back.

                             ichabod
               the horseman.  yes.

                             old crone
               sit.

     ichabod sits on crooked stool.  the old crone kneels with her
     back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.

                             ichabod 
               can you help?

                             old crone 
               you want to see into the nether world...
               i can show you.  whatever you see, do
               not move or speak.  i will hold him.

     she gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.

                             ichabod
               what... what are you doing?

                             old crone
                     (turns, furious) 
               close your mouth!  keep silent.

     she takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from
     one.  she shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and
     upends it.  a baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.

     the old crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its
     head.  she soaks the straw with blood, speaking in tongues,
     guttural.  using a wick, she lights the straw.

     she grasps two metal cuffs with chains attached, slides these
     onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

                             old crone 
               he comes now.

     ichabod would like to leave now.
