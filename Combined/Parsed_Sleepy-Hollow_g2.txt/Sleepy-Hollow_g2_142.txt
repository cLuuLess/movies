     ext.  the long straight road -- day

     raining hard.  baltus and lady van tassel ride.

                             baltus 
               hurry along.  the meeting has most
               certainly already begun.  we do not
               want steenwyck as our enemy.

     lady van tassel trails.  wood is heard splintering...

     just off the road, a tree falls...

     the trunk catches lady van tassel's horse on its rear flank.

     the horse falls.  lady van tassel hits the dirt.

     baltus looks back, halting.

     lady van tassel looks up to baltus in fear, then turns.

     behind her, the headless horseman trots from, the forest on
     daredevil, stops.  calm.  he takes his axe in hand.
