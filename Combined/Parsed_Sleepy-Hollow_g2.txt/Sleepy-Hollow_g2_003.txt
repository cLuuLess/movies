     ext.  watchhouse/jail -- night

     the elderly high constable lifts a blanket off the corpse on
     a wheelbarrow manned by constable two.  a snobby magistrate
     looks, disgusted.  constable one and ichabod wait.

                             high constable
               burn it.

                             constable one
               yes, sir.

     constable two wheels the corpse inside.  ichabod's dismayed.

                             ichabod
               just a moment... if i may.  it is
               possible this man was murdered.

                             high constable
               he drowned.  anyone could see.

                             ichabod
               there are surgical ways of telling
               how he died... by the water in his
               lungs...

     ichabod follows the high constable and magistrate in.
