     int.  van tassel house, kitchen -- morning

     lady van tassel prepares food with two servants at the open
     fireplace/oven.  ichabod enters, rushed.

                             ichabod 
               excuse me, lady van tassel... katrina
               is not in her room.

                             lady van tassel 
               no.  she has gone out.

                             ichabod 
               where?

                             lady van tassel 
               she has taken the last of our grain
               to be milled.
                     (crossing to him) 
               you do have a background in the
               medical arts, don't you, constable?

                             ichabod
               very little.  i must be going...

     lady van tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.

                             lady van tassel
               will you look at this?  i cut my hand
               this morning: i sewed it myself, but
               i am afraid it will go bad.

     ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

                             ichabod
               it appears well.  it has already
               clotted.

                             lady van tassel 
               look closer.  do you have anything to
               clean it with?

                             ichabod
               it is fine.  now, i must...

     lady van tassel grabs ichabod by the wrist, tight.

                             lady van tassel
                     (whispering, close) 
               i know you saw me.

                             ichabod
               what... ?

     lady van tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low.

                             lady van tassel 
               i know you followed last night.  you
               must promise not to tell baltus...

     ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  the front
     door is heard slamming.  ichabod is panicky.

                             lady van tassel 
               have mercy on me.  please... have mercy.

     ichabod pulls away just as baltus enters.  lady van tassel
     goes back to work as if nothing happened.

                             baltus 
               constable, it is urgent that we speak.
