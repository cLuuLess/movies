     ext.  town square/church -- day

     wagons, horses and townspeople swarm.  a crowd loots the
     town's general store.  provisions are passed along man to man
     and loaded on wheelbarrows.

     all up and down the long straight road, home owners board up
     windows with lumber.

     ichabod and young masbath ride, passing many angry faces.

                             ichabod
               panic has set in.

     they stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door
     of the "notary."  ichabod looks off...

     down the road, at the far end, people head to the church.
     much activity there as well.

                             ichabod
               sanctuary.  or, so they hope.

     families put up tents all around the church within the
     bordering wrought-iron fence.  supplies abound.

     people work to build and erect massive wooden crosses.
