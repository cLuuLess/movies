     int.  van tassel house, dining/various rooms -- day

     dining room.  sarah and two other servants collect plates.  a
     few people still sup, including van ripper, his warty wife
     and two kids.  van ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something
     his also-drunk wife says.

     in the hall and foyer, funeral goers socialize quietly.

     further on, in the sitting room, men smoke.  young masbath
     is confronting ichabod, who is leaving...

                             ichabod 
               i am not here for revenge.  i am
               here to bring justice.

                             young masbath 
               whatever.  you still need a second
               to tend to your things.

                             ichabod 
               i manage fine alone.

                             young masbath 
               i deserve to help you.  don't you see
               how much this means?  my father...
               he... he was a good man...

                             ichabod
                     (faces masbath) 
               young masbath, i am sorry for your
               loss.  it is a great and sad tragedy.
               however... i cannot be the one to
               look after you now.

                             young masbath
                     (angry) 
               i did not ask you to, did i?

     young masbath exits.  ichabod remains impassive.
