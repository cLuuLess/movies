     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- day

     young masbath is seated, bored.  ichabod writes in his
     ledger.  a knock on the door.  they both look up.

                             katrina (o.s.)
                     (from outside door)
               constable... are you there?
                     (long pause)
               ichabod?

     the knob is tried and found locked.  pause.  at the bottom of
     the door, a red rose is passed under.

     this saddens ichabod.
