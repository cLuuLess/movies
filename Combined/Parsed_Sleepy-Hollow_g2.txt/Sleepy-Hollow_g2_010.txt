     ext.  upstate forests -- day

     two families of migrant workers travel a path, leading over-
     burdened horses.  ichabod's coach approaches from the other
     direction.  ichabod looks out, unnerved.

     one gaunt man watches ichabod pass.  there is a dead, worried
     look in the man's eyes.  others stare at ichabod.
