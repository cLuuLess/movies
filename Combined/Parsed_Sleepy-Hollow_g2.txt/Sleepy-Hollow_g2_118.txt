     int.  notary public, records room (time cut) -- day

     hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.
     ichabod and young masbath face official-looking documents,
     with ichabod focused on one will in hand.

                             young masbath 
               my father had farm land.  it was the
               only thing we owned of any value.

                             ichabod
                     (still reading) 
               and it now belongs to you, according
               to baltus.  i heard him say it.

                             young masbath 
               yes.

     ichabod turns the will in his hand to masbath.

                             ichabod 
               then look here at your father's will,
               and tell me why you are not listed.

     young masbath takes it, boggled.  ichabod grabs another.

                             ichabod 
               van garrett had denoted his elder son
               in his last wishes; the same son
               murdered along with him.  but van
               garrett's wife and two infant children
               are not written... and they were spared.
                     (picks up another will)
               do you see?  philipse had no family to
               bestow his farm to.  but, here...
                     (picks up another) 
               the widow windsor was listed on her
               late husband's will.  after her
               inheritance, she amended the document
               to include her bastard child.  this is
               why the horseman made absolutely
               certain to impale the unborn descendant.

     ichabod sits back.

                             ichabod 
               only the heirs were killed.  proof that
               the horseman slaughters by assignment.

                             young masbath 
               but, if the farm is not mine, who stole
               it away?

                             ichabod 
               no one yet, far as i can tell.  it has
               gone intestate.

                             young masbath 
               in test... what?

                             ichabod 
               intestate.  your farm... all the
               farms... they belong to no one.

                             young masbath 
               what does it mean?

     ichabod stares off.

                             ichabod 
               often in such cases, property which
               has gone intestate legally passes to
               whomever the deceased was indebted to.
               and, who in this town is owed a great
               many debts?

                             young masbath 
                     (realization) 
               baltus van tassel.

                             ichabod 
               did your father take a loan?

                             young masbath 
               yes.  i rode with him on payment days.

     ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.

                             ichabod 
               tonight, we answer questions.  and, to
               discover who moves about the van tassel
               house after dark... all we need is a
               candle.

     a loud noise is heard from the other room.  ichabod looks.
