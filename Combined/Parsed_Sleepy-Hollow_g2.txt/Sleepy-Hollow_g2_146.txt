     int.  church -- day

     ichabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked
     citizens.  he sees katrina moving up the aisle...

     she's heading towards baltus, who slams against the door to
     steenwyck's room.

                             baltus 
               damn you, steenwyck!  help me!
               let me in!

     rifles boom loudly as men at the windows begin firing.
