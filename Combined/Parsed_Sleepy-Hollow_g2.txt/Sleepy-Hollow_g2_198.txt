     int.  windmill -- night

     ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.
     more and more dust rises.

     below, the horseman enters.  katrina shouts from above.

                             young masbath
               look out!

     the horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,
     but ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...

     the horseman just misses the final rung.

     ichabod throws the ladder aside as the horseman backs off.

     ichabod looks to the staircase.  no way to climb down from
     the milling platform and get there.

     the horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...

     the horseman climbs the chain, swinging...

     ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...

     ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.

     the rail creaks, about to break.  behind, the horseman lands
     on the milling platform.

     ichabod is losing grip.  young masbath races down the stairs,
     grabs his hand.  he pulls ichabod up.

     ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.

     ichabod and young masbath look...

     the horseman, following ichabod's lead, runs across the
     milling platform and leaps...

     grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from ichabod and
     masbath.  ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...

     the horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.

     ichabod pushes masbath up the stairs.
