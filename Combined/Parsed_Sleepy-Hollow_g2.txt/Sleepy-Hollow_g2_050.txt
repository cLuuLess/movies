     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- day

     a drawing of the lenape's woven piece in ichabod's ledger.
     the piece lies near.

     ichabod sits staring at it, trance-like.  masbath waits.
     long silence.

                             ichabod
               the lenape indian had much to tell
               once i opened his mouth.

                             young masbath 
               how could he?

                             ichabod
               his teeth.  someone had cut them and
               chipped off rotten pieces far back
               in his mouth.  the lenape could not
               have done that for himself.
                     (closes his journal)
               someone out there cared for him.

     ichabod rises, deciding.  he picks up his satchel and exits.
     young masbath is surprised.  he follows.
