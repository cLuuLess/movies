     int.  van tassel house, parlor -- day

     doctor lancaster, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by
     the fire, joining baltus and three other elders.  a pretty
     servant, sarah, brings a pipe cradle while lady van tassel
     sets down food.  ichabod is standing.

                             baltus
               that will be all, ladies.
                     (waits as they exit)
               we are joined by doctor thomas
               lancaster, constable.  and to his
               left are, clergyman steenwyck and
               our able magistrate, samuel philipse,
               both keeping order in their own ways.

     philipse is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in
     mouth.  clergyman steenwyck is formidably built, wearing a
     constant look of disapproval.

                             baltus
               i myself am in charge of financial
               matters and the regulation of
               currency in our commonwealth.  and,
               lastly, this fine fellow is james
               hardenbrook, our notary.

     hardenbrook is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind.

                             ichabod
               an honor, gentlemen.  in time i
               will need every detail of the
               three murderings you've had, but,
               for now, i ask only if you have
               any theory at all as to who the
               killer might be?

                             doctor lancaster
               excuse me?

                             ichabod
               i say, is there any one person
               suspect in these acts?

                             doctor lancaster
               i was afraid of this.

     philipse shoots a look to baltus.  angst amongst the elders.

                             philipse
               well, constable... are you aware...
               to be honest, you are not what we
               expected.  we sent for the militia.

                             ichabod
               the militia?

                             father steenwyck
               why not tell us what you have heard?
               hmm?  how much have your superiors
               bothered to tell you?

                             ichabod
               all i know is three are slain, their
               heads found severed from their
               bodies...

                             father steenwyck
               the heads were not found severed.
               the heads were not found at all.

     withered hardenbrook leans forward, his voice cragged.

                             hardenbrook
               taken.  taken by the headless
               horseman.  taken back to hell.

                             ichabod
               pardon me?

                             baltus
               you have not been well informed of
               our troubles, sir.  if you would...

     baltus gestures for ichabod to sit.  baltus lights his pipe.

                             baltus
               the horseman... he was a hessian
               mercenary, sent to our shores by
               german princes to help keep
               americans under the thumb of
               england.  however, unlike his
               compatriots who came as muscle in
               trade for currency, he came
               willingly.  for love of carnage.

     flashback -- american battlefield -- day

     the hessian horseman rides his black steed into a gory,
     close-quarters clash, his cloaked uniform adorned with edged
     weapons.  he cuts down americans left and right.

                             baltus (v.o.)
               he was infamous for taking his
               horse, daredevil, hard into
               battle... chopping off heads at
               full gallop.

     he dismounts, hoisting a battle axe.  with sword and axe, he
     annihilates.  blood gushes.  bones crack.

                             baltus (v.o.)
               just to look on him made your
               blood run cold, for he had filed
               down his teeth to rapiers... to
               add to the ferocity of his
               appearance.

     the horseman lets out a war cry.  jagged teeth.  grotesque.

     forest battlefield -- day

     winter.  cannons can be heard booming from afar.  daredevil
     lies dead in red snow.  follow footprints away...

                             baltus (v.o.)
               he would not finally meet his end
               till the winter of seventy-nine,
               when new york city was held by
               henry clinton and washington
               occupied west point.  it was
               between those two places, not far
               from here...

     the horseman flees, cloak flowing, chased by five rag-tag
     revolutionary soldiers.  ahead, a steep, rocky area prevents
     escape.  soldier one aims a rifle and fires...

     blood explodes from the horseman's arm as he runs.  his sword
     falls from his now functionless hand.

     soldier two grabs the sword.

     at the rocks, the horseman faces the men.  another rifleman
     raises his rifle.  the horseman reaches over his shoulder to
     grasp a sheathed knife, throws --

     thock!  the rifleman jerks back, knife in his eye socket.

     the horseman readies an axe.  the revolutionaries move in
     with swords.  they battle, steel against steel.  the horseman
     fends off blows from all sides.

     soldier three lunges, stabs his blade deep into the
     horseman's side.  the horseman roars, brings his axe down...
     breaks the sword at the hilt...

     an upwards stroke sends soldier three head over heels in a
     fountain of blood.

     the horseman staggers, howling, trying to pull the blade from
     his ribs.  the remaining soldiers close in.
