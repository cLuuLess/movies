     int.  windmill -- night

     ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door...
     slams it.  he closes the latch just as the horseman hits.
     the door buckles.

                             young masbath 
               it won't hold.

     ichabod goes to a large grindstone against a wall.  he
     struggles to roll it.

     young masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  it falls
     on top with a thud.  the horseman's sword jabs up through the
     grindstone's center hole.

     the sword withdraws.  a pounding begins.
