     ext.  van tassel house -- early evening

     it's getting dark.  ichabod comes out and crosses the porch.
     a few of the hollow's residents are here.  young masbath gets
     up and follows ichabod onto the lawn.

     ichabod walks without waiting.

                             young masbath
               she's the one who controlled the
               horseman, isn't she, sir?  sir? 
                     (no answer)

                             ichabod 
               i need time for thinking.  without you
               hanging on my coattails for a change.

     ichabod keeps walking.  young masbath stops, wounded.
