     int.  ichabod's coach -- night

     ichabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  the window
     between him and the driver slides open.

                             van ripper 
               sir... this is yours.
                     (offering something) 
               the van tassel girl said to give it
               to you after you were gone.

     ichabod takes it.  it is the bird/cage spinning toy.  he
     studies it.  what melancholy.
