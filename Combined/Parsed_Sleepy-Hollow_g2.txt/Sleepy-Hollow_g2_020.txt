     int. van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     ichabod leans on a dresser.  katrina's still seated.

                             katrina
               not all think it is the horseman.
               many say witches come from the
               western woods to steal skulls for
               their cauldrons.  some believe a
               person in this very town kneels
               before lucifer, offering death as
               tribute.  and, still others believe
               none of it.

                             ichabod
               are you so superstitious?

                             katrina
               to call a person superstitious is to
               imply they fear magic, but not all
               magic is black.

                             ichabod
               there is no such thing as magic.

                             katrina
               really?  then... what is your
               rebuttal to those romantic poets
               claiming proof of magic in a rose at
               full bloom, or even in a teardrop?

                             ichabod
               poets have silly notions about
               plants and bodily secretions.

                             katrina
                     (laughs)
               you are funny.

     ichabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  the distant
     toll of a bell is heard.  katrina looks fearful.

     she goes to open a window.  the bell tolls...
