     ext.  sleepy hollow forests, further on -- morning

     brom and baltus stand at a horse's corpse amongst jagged
     boulders.  the flesh has been stripped, guts exposed.
     philipse and ichabod arrive and dismount.

                             baltus 
               was this jonathan's?

                             brom 
               yes.  seems he panicked across here
               and broke two legs.

                             ichabod 
               who took the meat?

                             baltus 
               must have been the redman.  a lenape
               indian lives in the western woods.

                             ichabod 
               these woods of yours sound a bit
               crowded, what with all the witches,
               ghouls and indians living there.

     brom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty.

                             brom 
               there's only one lenape.  he eats
               small animals and lost children...
               and the occasional constable when he
               can get it.

     brom rides.  ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his
     satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one
     horseshoe.  a whistle is heard o.s.

     everyone looks far ahead to where van ripper has ridden.  the
     doctor and others are there.  van ripper waves.
