     int.  windmill -- night

     pounding continues.  the grindstone shifts.  katrina and
     young masbath back away.  ichabod holds his lantern up,
     desperate for ideas, searching.

     above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is
     ground and bagged.  to the left is the crooked staircase.

     ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  he gives
     his lantern to katrina and points.

                             ichabod 
               get up those stairs.  open the door to
               the roof and wait.

     katrina and young masbath obey.  ichabod crosses and climbs
     the ladder to the milling platform.  he grasps a wooden
     lever, pulling it.  gears above begin to turn.
