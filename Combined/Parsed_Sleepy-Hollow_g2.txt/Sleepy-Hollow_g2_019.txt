     ext.  belltower field -- night

     the torches burn bright.  above, in the belltower, jonathan
     masbath loads a rifle.  thunder booms.

     jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon.
     a horse is heard shrieking.  below, the horse tied at the
     base of the tower is spooked.

     a commotion is heard, ground rumbling.  jonathan grips a
     rifle, cocks it and moves to look...

     at the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  they
     sprint past the tower and across the field.

     jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  he crosses back
     to peer at the forest.  bad news...

     a thick fog creeps from the woods.

     as the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of
     mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  all along the
     forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one...

     above, jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

                             jonathan
               come out, devil... come....
