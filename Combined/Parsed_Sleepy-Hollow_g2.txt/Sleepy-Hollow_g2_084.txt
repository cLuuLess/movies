     int.  killian's home, kitchen -- day

     small home.  killian, thomas and beth have finished supper.
     beth clears plates as killian picks his teeth with a knife.

                             thomas
               may i be excused, father?

                             killian
               do you deserve to be?

                             third man
                     (shyly)
               i think so.

                             killian
                     (smiles)
               then, go.

     thomas gets down from his chair.  he goes to the fireplace to
     light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room.
