     int.  cave home -- day

     ichabod and young masbath step in.

     walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed
     grass in patterns.  an old crone sits facing away.

     the old crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey
     features, sits disinterested.  ichabod edges closer.

                             ichabod
               pardon.  you did not answer when i
               knocked.  are we intruding?

                             old crone
               you are from the hollow?

                             ichabod
               in a way, yes.

     ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and
     acorns.  knifes, scissors, yellow bones.  he takes the
     lenape's piece of reed grass from his pocket.

                             ichabod
               the lenape who lived in these woods...
               do you know him?  the redman?
                     (uncomfortable wait)
               i should tell you... he has been
               murdered.

                             old crone
               leave me.  you are not welcome here.

     the old crone places something on a table beside her -- a
     dead cardinal, bright red.

     ichabod is afraid, backing away, but young masbath takes the
     woven piece and steps to the crone.

                             young masbath
               were you a friend to the indian?
                     (waits)
               you should have this... if you were
               his friend.

     young masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal.  he
     walks to join ichabod in leaving.

                             old crone
               you seek remedy against the horseman?

     the old crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  she stands,
     faces them.  tall.  ichabod nods.

                             old crone
                     (to young masbath)
               go out and keep away, child.
                     (to ichabod)
               you stay.  follow with me.

     the old crone takes a candle and walks, deep into the cave.
