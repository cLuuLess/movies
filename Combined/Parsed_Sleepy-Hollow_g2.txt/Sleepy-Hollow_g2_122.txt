     ext.  church -- night

     quiet night.  the church is a sight, with a yard resembling
     an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
     boarded over windows leak shafts of light.

     moving past the windows: many eyes peer out from the slats.

     up in the belfry, two riflemen are on watch.
