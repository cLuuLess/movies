     ext.  van tassel house, front porch -- day

     ichabod comes out.  killian, a dashingly rustic man, carries
     his son, thomas, 5, and chats with baltus.  doctor lancaster
     peers off at something through a spyglass.

                             baltus 
               hail, constable.  how are you?

                             ichabod 
               well enough.  your gathering does
               honor to the deceased.

                             doctor lancaster 
                     (still using spyglass) 
               we must be a curious sight to him.

                             ichabod 
               what are you spying on?

                             doctor lancaster
                     (offers the spyglass)
               the lenape.  he comes to gawk at
               civilization from time to time.

     ichabod's point of view -- through spyglass

     searching a line of trees and foliage far away...

                             doctor lancaster (o.s.)
               do you see the redskinned bastard?

     there he is -- the lenape.  a towering savage with misshapen
     features covered in tumors.  he ducks away.

     back to scene on porch

     ichabod lowers the spyglass, a little awed.

                             ichabod 
               he is a behemoth.

                             doctor lancaster 
               a diseased monster.

                             baltus 
               if you gentlemen will excuse the
               doctor and i... we have financial
               matters to discuss.

     ichabod and killian nod as baltus and lancaster head in.

                             killian 
               master crane, sir.  i'm glad we have
               time alone.  you've been told plenty
               about the horseman, i'm certain.

                             ichabod 
               more than enough, actually. 
                     (tired laugh) 
               i beg you, no more, please.

                             killian 
               no, sir, no.  if you ask me, i say
               you just laid eyes on our murderer
               through that glass.

     ichabod ponders, folding the spyglass.

                             ichabod 
               tell me something. 
                     (pause) 
               what becomes of young masbath?

                             killian 
               van ripper and his wife agreed to take
               him.  they have children and a good
               home and good land.

     ichabod nods.  he turns to look through the window.  in the
     dining room, van ripper rises, ill.  his wife questions his
     health, but he holds her off and vomits.

     ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.
