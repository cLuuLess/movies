     int.  watchhouse, night watch quarters -- night

     constable two wheels the body ahead past many "booking"
     tables.  a jailer moves to unlock a massive door.

                             high constable
               he will be burned pursuant to
               statutes of health.

               i could determine if he were dead
               before he went into the hudson.

                             high constable
               must we again hear these heretical
               rantings?

                             magistrate
               yes, must we?

                             ichabod
               there is nothing heretical about
               science, sir.  the chinese have
               written on it for hundreds of
               years... procedural study used to
               solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.

     the door is opened.  the corpse again leads the way.
