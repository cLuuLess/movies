     int.  killian's home, white room -- day

     thomas plops on the floor and lights his magic lantern: a
     lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with
     silhouettes of lions and monsters.

     thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the
     creatures, shadows are thrown.  he roars for them, imagining
     them real and having a grand time.
