     ext.  western woods -- day

     heavy rain.  ichabod and young masbath ride side by side.

                             young masbath 
               if the crone's wound bled hard, that
               means she was not killed by the
               hessian.  someone only tried to make
               it look that way.

                             ichabod 
               you grow sharper by the minute, little
               man.  it boggles my mind, but i begin
               to prefer your company over all others.

                             young masbath 
               well... i'm one of the few people who
               likes you.

                             ichabod
                     (laughs) 
               true enough.

                             young masbath 
               then, who murdered the old crone?  and
               why?

                             ichabod 
               good questions, deserving answers, of
               which we are in short supply.

     a sound is heard.  ichabod looks back, then to masbath.

                             ichabod 
               quicken pace.

     ichabod rides faster.  young masbath keeps up.

     further on, they charge over a hill.  ichabod halts gunpowder
     and climbs clumsily off.

                             ichabod 
               ride on.

     young masbath obeys.  ichabod takes out his pistol and wades
     into forest growth, backtracking.

     inside the forest, ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  a
     horse is heard snorting.  he pushes through branches...

     moving behind a figure in a grey cloak on horseback.

                             ichabod 
               halt and turn.  i have a pistol aimed
               at your head.

     the figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  katrina.

                             katrina 
               it is only me.

                             ichabod
               katrina.  why do you follow?

                             katrina
               i apologize if i worried you.

                             ichabod 
               a woman should not be out alone in
               these woods.

                             katrina 
               but, i am not alone, am i?  i only
               wished to see what you were up to,
               and...
                     (takes out white rose) 
               to thank you.

     ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.

                             ichabod
               come along.
