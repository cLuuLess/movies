     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     ichabod makes notations in a ledger book.

                             katrina (v.o.)
               you will dream.

     katrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  ichabod is nervous.

                             katrina
               did they tell?  it is something in
               the air so that dreams come to
               everyone.  according to the elders,
               an indian prophet held powwows here
               before the land was taken, and
               spells cast then still linger to
               this day.

                             ichabod
               do you often make a habit of
               sitting on strange men's beds?

                             katrina
               you are horribly old-fashioned,
               aren't you?

                             ichabod
               feel free to form your own opinion.
                     (facing his ledger)
               though it appears you already have.

                             katrina
               well, i intended to apologize for
               the behavior of my friend brom van
               brunt, but it seems i've made
               matters worse.
                     (getting up to go)
               i'll leave you to your business.

                             ichabod
               excuse me... i should apologize.  i,
               um... i... have no great love of...

                             katrina
               other people?

                             ichabod
               small talk.

                             katrina
               it might have been more.  might have
               been positively grand talk.

     ichabod offers his chair, backing away.  seeing it is the
     only one, he remains standing.  katrina sits.

                             katrina
               is it me, or are you this nervous
               around all women?

                             ichabod
               perhaps it is because your suitor's
               hands were recently very nearly
               wrapped around my throat.

                             katrina
               my suitor?

                             ichabod
               the massive fellow... brom.  for
               someone you call "friend," he
               misplaces a good portion of jealousy.

                             katrina
               he has proposed to me twice.

                             ichabod
               which may explain his temperament.
               to have asked twice means the answer
               was "no" at least once.

     katrina looks down, discards this with a smile.

                             katrina
               i've read a great deal about your
               new york city.  do be a dear and tell
               me all about it.  sounds like an
               extraordinary place to live a life.

                             ichabod
               extra ordinary, yes.  but first, you
               tell me about the headless horseman.
