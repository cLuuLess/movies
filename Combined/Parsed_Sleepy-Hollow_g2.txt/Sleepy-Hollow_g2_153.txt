     ext.  church -- day

     baltus crashes out, hits the ground, dragged...

     outside the fence, daredevil runs with the rope tied around
     his saddle pommel.  the horseman strides forward, sword out.

     baltus slams the fence and the rope snaps.  he is held there
     awkwardly, gurgling blood.

     the horseman reaches baltus... chops off his head.
