     ext.  forest -- day

     a conjuring pile of straw burns.  gloved hands unfold a paper
     filled with clippings of human hair.  the hair is sprinkled
     on the fire.

     a cloaked figure is kneeled at the pile.  the figure turns to
     remove a human skull from a cloth bag.

     the skull is placed at center in the flames.  it's teeth are
     sharp, cut to points.  the horseman's skull.
