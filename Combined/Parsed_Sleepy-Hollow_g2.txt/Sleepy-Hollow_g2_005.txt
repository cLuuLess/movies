     int.  watchhouse, jail -- night

     a two-tiered prison, alive with moans of agony and cries of
     insanity.  cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron
     gags.  many are against the bars, watching.

                             ichabod
               our first night watch is adequate
               against fire and some violence,
               but if we were more often able to
               ensure justice, after the fact,
               then criminals would truly have
               something to fear from law
               enforcement.

                             high constable
               have they nothing to fear presently?

                             ichabod
               without disrespect, look around you.
                     (motioning to cells)
               we overflow.  as do our courts.

                             high constable
               and, with disrespect, constable,
               if jails and courts overflow, it is
               testimony to success, not failure.

                             ichabod
               but, how many innocents rot here?
               and, how many victims are buried
               without reprisal while guilty men
               roam our streets?

     the high constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.  guards
     wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.

                             high constable
               very few, if any.

                             ichabod
               even though i have seen confessions
               pried from the lips of the accused,
               often quite literally?

                             high constable
               for one who calls himself a
               federalist, your mouth reeks of
               republican liberalism.

                             ichabod
               not liberalism.  equanimity.

                             magistrate
                     (to high constable)
               um, sir... might i suggest...

     the magistrate whispers in the high constable's ear.  ichabod
     notices with worry that constables one and two wheel the
     corpse onwards into another room.

     the magistrate finishes.  the high constable smiles faintly.

                             high constable
                     (to ichabod)
               there is a farming community
               upstate, constable... ten days
               journey north in the hudson
               highlands.  it is named sleepy
               hollow.  within a fortnight, three
               persons have been murdered there.
               each with their head lopped cleanly
               off.
                     (holds up papers)
               the elders of the hollow have sent
               dispatches to me, requesting
               assistance, and now, just this very
               moment, i have chosen you.

                             ichabod
               chosen me?

                             high constable
               these "methods" of yours... there
               has been no practical application.

                             ichabod
               not for lack of trying.

                             high constable
               just so.  granted.  and so you take
               your experimentations to sleepy
               hollow and catch the murderer who
               has tainted the place.  bring him
               here to face our good justice.
               will you do this for me?

                             ichabod
                     (swallowing doubt)
               i shall, gladly.

                             high constable
               excellent.  then, you are excused
               till morning.

     ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.

                             high constable
               oh, and, constable...
                     (off ichabod's look)
               do make certain that you meet with
               success.  otherwise... perhaps you
               should not come back at all.

     the high constable smiles a sardonic smile.
