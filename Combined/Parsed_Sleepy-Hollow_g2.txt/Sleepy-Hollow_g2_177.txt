     ext.  forest -- night

     in a wooded area, katrina lies unconscious.  gloved hands
     reach to her hair and cut off a clump with scissors.

     a conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's
     heart with an iron nail through it.  katrina's hair is added
     and the pile is lit to burn.

     nearby, young masbath watches, on his belly with his hands
     tied behind his back.

     lady van tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied
     nearby.  she looks to katrina, who stirs.

     lady van tassel takes the horseman's skull from a bag over
     her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  thunder is
     heard.  lady van tassel looks up, smiles.
