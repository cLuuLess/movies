     int.  church -- day

     pews are packed.  steenwyck enters, walks to the altar.
     everyone quiets.  steenwyck has composed himself, barely.

                             father steenwyck 
               my friends... dear friends.  those of
               you still on your farms, i thank you
               for coming.

     he sees ichabod near the back.  thunder is heard outside.

                             father steenwyck 
               i... i address unfortunate business. 
                     (pause) 
               i am forced to take my leave from
               sleepy hollow.  i will be moving on to
               do the lord's work elsewhere.

     the gatherers murmur shock.  ichabod walks out.
