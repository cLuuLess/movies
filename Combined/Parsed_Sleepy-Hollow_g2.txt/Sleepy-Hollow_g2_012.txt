     ext.  sleepy hollow, town square -- day

     ichabod walks on with baggage.  the square is empty, a church
     and graveyard at one end.  the road ahead is bordered by
     businesses and homes.

     conversation drifts from a tavern.  a criminal sits in
     stocks.  a quiet crying is heard.  ichabod hears...

     he looks for its source.  it's from a window above, louder.
     sounds like the sobbing of an old woman.
