     ext.  forest -- day (time cut)

     a fire burns in a circle of rocks.  ichabod's ledger is
     thrown in.  the pages catch quickly.

     ichabod watches, then walks away.  he's about to climb onto
     gunpowder, but on second thought he opens his satchel and
     digs out a book.  he walks back to the fire, throws it on...

     "romeo and juliet."  flames devour it.
