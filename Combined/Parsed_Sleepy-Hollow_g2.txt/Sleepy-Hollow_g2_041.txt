     int.  van tassel house, sewing room -- night

     opposite an elaborate loom, katrina reads by candlelight.
     she looks up, seeing ichabod enter.

                             ichabod 
               sorry for disturbing you.  i thought
               a forgotten candle was burning.

     katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with
     another on her lap and covers them.

                             katrina 
               you do not disturb me.  please stay.
               having trouble sleeping?

                             ichabod 
               may i ask... why do you cover your
               book that way?

                             katrina 
               you pay great attention to small
               things.  i hide these as i hide all
               my books.  father would not approve,
               lest it were the bible.

                             ichabod 
               i, um... i have something to show you,
               if you have a moment.

     ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.

                             katrina
               these are strange... may i?

     she takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  she
     touches the many evenly spaced scars.

                             katrina 
               these scars.  how did you get them?

                             ichabod 
               i have had them since childhood.  i
               cannot remember what from.

                             katrina 
               it would be interesting to find out.

     their eyes meet.  ichabod gets back to the ledger.  katrina
     seems to relish the effect she has.  ichabod finds a paper
     disk on string, illustrated thusly:

                             ichabod 
               here it is.  a bird on one side.
               his cage on the other.  now,
               stare at it. 
                     (spinning it) 
               the bird seems to be in his cage.

                             katrina 
               yes, he does.  may i try?

     ichabod gives it.  she spins it, smiling.

                             ichabod 
               he only appears to be inside the
               cage.  the point being...

                             katrina
               you made this, and the drawings?

                             ichabod 
               yes, but listen.  the illusion is
               easily explained.  the eye retains
               each image, till they combine.  and
               yet, some would call this toy magic.

                             katrina 
               don't you see why?  look closely a
               moment.  put your intellect aside. 
                     (spinning it) 
               can't you see what is inexplicable?

     ichabod watches it spin.  he shakes his head, unimpressed.

                             katrina 
               oh, you are hopeless.  may i keep
               it at least?

                             ichabod
               if you want.  but...

                             katrina 
               then, i also have a gift for you.
               true magic which even you will not
               be able to deny.

     she hands him a book.  "romeo and juliet."  ichabod stands,
     offering it back, but she will not take it.

                             ichabod 
               thank you.  no.  here...

                             katrina 
               i insist that you have it.

                             ichabod
                     (resigned, leaving) 
               very well.  but, it will only sit
               gathering dust.

                             katrina 
               that would be a pity.  those words
               might show you something you've never
               seen before.

     ichabod stops at the door, looks back.  he exits.
