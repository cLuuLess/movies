     int.  killian's home, kitchen -- day

     with a roar, the fire flares.  killian looks.

     whhooosh the fire shoots up the fireplace.  gone.

     behind killian, the door splinters inwards.  the horseman
     steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  wind blasts...

     the door to the other room slams.

     killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the horseman.
     the horseman swings, smashing it aside.

                             killian
               beth... run!
