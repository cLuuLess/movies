     int. forest, masbath murder site -- morning

     doctor lancaster stands with several armed men.  a coffin on
     a cart is covered by a blanket. ichabod is crouched nearby.

                             ichabod 
               why did you move the body, doctor?

                             doctor lancaster 
               to place it inside its coffin.

     ichabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  he puts the horseshoe into a
     hoofprint in the dirt.  it fits.

     ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.
     brom, van ripper, baltus and philipse watch.

     ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  huge.  he compares the
     horseshoe.  the hoofprint is much larger.

     ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl,
     bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water
     and powder with a fork to make plaster.

     the others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  brom
     comes up to stand over ichabod, irritated.

                             brom 
               what the hell are you doing?

                             ichabod
                     (ignoring pause) 
               you are the blacksmith.  ever shod
               a horse with a hoof this large?

                             brom 
               never.  a shoe that size i would
               have remembered.

     ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster.

                             ichabod 
               van ripper.  can you show where the
               body lay?

                             van ripper 
               i can show exactly.

     van ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  ichabod rises to
     follow with his satchel.

                             van ripper 
               here... in front of this oak, facing
               north.  horrible...

                             ichabod 
               to the best of your recollection,
               where did the open wound fall?

     van ripper points.  ichabod takes a bottle of white powder
     from his pocket.

     he uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on
     the dirt there, then waiting.

     a chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit.

                             ichabod 
               there was not much blood, was there?

                             van ripper 
               i didn't see none.

     ichabod stands, puzzled.  he walks to the coffin cart,
     rolling up his sleeves.  others come to watch, but keep
     distance.  ichabod removes the blanket...

     reveals jonathan's headless corpse.

     philipse can't look.  ichabod takes strange spectacles from
     his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  magnification
     spectacles.  he examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it.

     he pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord.

                             ichabod 
               no bleeding.

                             doctor lancaster 
               what is that?

                             ichabod 
               this should have bled by the pint.
               yet, no blistering or scorched flesh.
               how... ?  whatever weapon was used...
               it cauterized somehow....

     ichabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles.

                             ichabod 
               it instantly burnt the wound shut.
