     ext.  churchyard and cemetery -- day

     a coffin in a grave.  headstone reads "masbath, 1799."  a
     crowd gathered.  young masbath broods.  clergyman steenwyck
     steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt.

     men with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard.

     steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words.
     in the crowd people whisper.  they steal glances at ichabod,
     who stands with the van tassels.
