     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     ichabod sleeps, dreaming...

     ichabod's dream -- farmland -- day

     a young boy, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us.
     a female voice is heard faintly, getting louder.

                             female voice (o.s.)
               ichabod!  ichabod... come along.

     the boy, young ichabod, turns, smiling.  he runs.  we follow
     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  mother waits.  lovely
     woman.  she kisses him.

     ichabod's dream -- young ichabod's bedroom -- night

     dark.  young ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  across the
     room, mother has her back to him.  she's whispering something
     to no one.  she turns...

     young ichabod pretends he is asleep.

     a drawer is heard shutting.  mother exits.  ichabod gets up,
     curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing.

     it's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern
     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  young ichabod
     replaces it, closes the drawer.

     ichabod's dream -- market square -- day

     a busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  young
     ichabod walks with father, an emotionless man.  father stops
     to examine tools.  young ichabod stays by him, but something
     captures his attention...

     across the way, mother is involved in a argument with a
     freakish-looking woman.  they shout.  people stop to watch.
     can't make out words, but freakish woman is furious.

     ichabod's dream -- storm sky -- night

     lightning flashes over tree tops.  thunder booms.
