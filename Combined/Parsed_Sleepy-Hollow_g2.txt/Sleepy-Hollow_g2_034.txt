     ext. churchyard and cemetery -- dawn

     steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at ichabod, furious.

                             father steenwyck 
               it is sacrilege!

                             ichabod 
               i cannot proceed without examining
               the previous victims.

     steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  killian's there.
     philipse, hung-over, stands beside young masbath.

                             father steenwyck 
               magistrate philipse, surely you can
               stop this.

     philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.

                             father steenwyck 
               i will not allow it.  i will not!

                             ichabod 
               protest to my superiors if you like.

                             father steenwyck
               your superiors are two days away!

                             ichabod 
               then, you should have left two days
               ago, because i have men willing to
               help me today.

     ichabod motions.  killian leads the men to the graveyard.
     steenwyck watches, enraged.  he kicks his horse and rides.
     philipse looks worried.
