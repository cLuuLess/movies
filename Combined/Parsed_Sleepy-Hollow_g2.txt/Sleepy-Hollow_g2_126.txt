     int.  van tassel house, baltus' office -- night

     ichabod and young masbath enter, shutting the door.  ichabod
     walks to shelves at baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound
     documents and hands some to masbath.

     young masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these "loan
     agreement" parchments.  ichabod brings another pile.

                             ichabod
                     (whispering)
               they are alphabetical.

     young masbath has the m's.  "maryie," "megapolenisis," and
     "melyn..." not finding what he wants.

                             young masbath 
               there is no masbath here.  my father's
               loan papers are missing.

                             ichabod
                     (regarding his documents) 
               there are none for magistrate philipse
               either.  "paasch, james" "pieter,
               thomas" "pos, william."

     a floorboard creaks.  ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
     he and young masbath stand frozen.

     across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then
     continues.  a door is heard opening and shutting.  ichabod
     crosses to follow, pointing back.

                             ichabod 
               keep looking.  then, hide in my room
               and bolt the door till i return.
