     ext.  church/town square -- night

     ichabod charges up to the church doors, pounding.

                             ichabod
               open the door.  open up, damn it!
                     (pounds, shouting)
               lady van tassel is alive.  the horseman
               is her puppet.  please... 

     the door opens and huge farmer points a rifle at ichabod.
     frightened people peer out from behind.

                             huge farmer 
               aren't we rid of you?

                             ichabod 
               listen to me.  lady van tassel has
               faked her death.  i need able men...

                             huge farmer
               she's dead, and you have gone mad.

                             ichabod
               no...

                             huge farmer 
                     (steps forward) 
               get out!  isn't it enough that you have
               ruined this town?  go!

     ichabod backs away from the gun, frustrated, runs...

     at the doctor's residence, van ripper is still on the coach.
     ichabod sprints over, breathless, taking out his pistol.

                             ichabod
               van ripper... do you have a gun?

                             van ripper
               yes.  here...

     van ripper hold up a rifle.  ichabod holds out his hand.

                             ichabod 
               may i see it?

     van ripper's confused, but hands the rifle over.  ichabod
     immediately points his pistol at van ripper.

                             ichabod
               get down.  hurry!

     van ripper climbs off.  ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.

                             ichabod 
               sorry.

     van ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.
