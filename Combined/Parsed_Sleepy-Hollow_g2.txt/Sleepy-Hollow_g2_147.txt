     ext.  church -- day

     the horseman circles, under fire.

     great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church.

     men fire down from the belfry.

     parts of the horseman and daredevil splatter red into the
     rain as slugs hit without effect.

     at the other side of the church, the horseman comes around,
     heading to the town square.
