     forward on a long pole. he looks back, terrified.

     thunderous hoofbeats are heard behind.

     the ugly man glances back again.  his lantern swings wild...
     shatters against a tree.  the jammed-up pole slams the ugly
     man off his horse...

     he hits the ground.  he runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.

     deep in the forest, we glimpse the source of the hoofbeats: a
     huge form on a huge black horse, already gone.

     the ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  jagged branches
     slit his hands and cheeks.

     he bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  he
     lifts his bloodied face.  he runs.

     in the forest behind: the hooves of the black horse rip
     underbrush.  hoofbeats deafening.  a spur digs into the
     snorting steed's already bleeding flank.

     the pursuer's gloved hand draws a sword, blade ringing.

     on the trail, the ugly man runs on.  the shrill whistle of a
     sword swing is heard as the pursuer blurs past.

     the ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
     impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... his headless
     body hits the dirt.
