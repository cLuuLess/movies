     int.  van tassel house, ichabod's room -- night

     in bed, ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more.

                             freakish woman (v.o.) 
               the night of the great storm, i saw
               her cross my windows.

     ichabod's dream -- courtroom -- day

     young ichabod is seated beside father, eyes tearful.  we are
     back in the court where mother stands trial.

                             freakish woman 
               in the lightning, i did see her.
                     (points to mother) 
               her. lady crane... i will never
               forget it.  the next moment, i found
               my infant son was dead, with the
               blood welt on his breast.

     the evil third man turns to a jury of twelve men.

                             third man 
               you have heard it.  the blood welt
               is the mark of satan's touch.

     as the crowd murmurs in fear, young ichabod looks to father,
     who sits with hands clenched, emotionless.

     ichabod's dream -- young ichabod's home -- night

     in the quiet kitchen, young ichabod looks across the table.
     father stares into his food.

                             young ichabod
               she was with me, father.

                             father
               nothing can be done against them.

                             young ichabod
               she was with me that night.

     father doesn't even look up.

     ichabod's dream -- church -- night

     empty church.  young ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  a
     soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle.

                             young ichabod
               may i see her?

     the soldier exits through a white door.  young ichabod waits,
     looking up at the vast church.  the white door opens and the
     third man steps out.

                             third man
               go home.

                             young ichabod
               may i see my mother?

                             third man
               you do not want to be here.  go home
               to your father.

                             young ichabod
               she did not do it... please listen...

                             third man
               she is guilty.

                             young ichabod
               no, sir, please... she is innocent...

                             third man
               she has confessed.

                             young ichabod
               no.

                             third man 
               she has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.  do
               you know what confession is?
                     (off ichabod's nod) 
               all that is left for you now is to
               pray for her soul.

     the third man leaves through the white door.

     ichabod's dream -- young ichabod's bedroom -- morning

     young ichabod buttons his shirt.

     ichabod's dream -- young ichabod's yard -- morning

     young ichabod comes out, looks to the lawn, not
     understanding.  father loads a wagon full of belongings.

                             father 
               we are leaving.
                     (long pause)
               she has gone away.

     realization comes to young ichabod.  he runs, away across the
     lawn as father calls after him.

     ichabod's dream -- forest trail -- morning

     young ichabod runs, weeping.

                             third man (v.o.) 
               she has confessed.

     ichabod's dream -- church -- morning

     empty.  doors are thrown open and young ichabod enters.  he
     goes down the aisle, towards the white door.

                             third man (v.o.) 
               she has admitted to her evil and
               signed a written confession.

                             young ichabod 
               mother.

     ichabod's dream -- church, beyond white door -- morning

     young ichabod enters, halting.  the room contains torture
     devices: iron cuffs, thumb screws, knifes and needles.

                             third man (v.o.)
               do you know what confession is?

     he walks, numb, eyes locked forward...

     in the corner is a spiked chair, adorned with sharp iron
     spikes.  hundreds of spikes.  it is fitted with straps for
     holding down the "accused."

     tears stream down young ichabod's face.  he kneels, hands on
     the spikes of the chair, pressing hard.

     as he sobs, blood runs down from his hands.
