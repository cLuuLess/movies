     int.  ichabod's home, second floor -- day

     decorated in early-american mad scientist: books, papers and
     jars of chemicals.  charts of anatomy above a small bed.

                             ichabod (o.s.)
               such a day for such a sad farewell.
               but, this is goodbye, my sweet.

     at the window, ichabod holds a bird cage with a red cardinal
     inside.  he opens the cage.  the bird flies free.

     ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  a coach halts in the
     street below.  the forlorn driver looks up.
