     int.  killian's home, kitchen -- day

     killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to
     fend off a blow from the horseman.

     the horseman swings the other axe.  killian ducks.  the axe
     cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks.

     killian lunges, jamming the skewer into the horseman.

     the skewer comes through the horseman's back.  the horseman
     swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding killian aside.

     killian hits the wall, bashing his head.  hits the floor.
