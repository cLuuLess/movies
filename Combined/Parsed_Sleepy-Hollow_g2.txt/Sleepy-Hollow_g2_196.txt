     int.  windmill -- night

     ichabod sees below... the horseman sticks a hand through,
     trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  the
     racking axe continues.  won't be long.

     ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with
     effort, throws...

     the bag smashes on the grindstone, busting the door...
