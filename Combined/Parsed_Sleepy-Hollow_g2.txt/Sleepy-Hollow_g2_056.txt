     ext.  western woods -- day

     dark, dense and creepy.  ichabod and young masbath move
     through.  young masbath halts his horse and looks around.

                             ichabod 
               what is it?

                             young masbath 
               listen.

                             ichabod
                     (listens, looks)
               i hear nothing.

                             young masbath 
               no crickets or cicadas calling.  no
               bird songs.

     stark quiet.  ichabod notes this unhappily.
