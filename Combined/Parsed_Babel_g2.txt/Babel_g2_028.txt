          28   int. bus -- moments later
          
               the bus drives on. some of the old men sleep. susan leans
               her head against the window and watches the landscape scroll
               past. richard sits beside her silently.
          
               susan holds out her hand and takes richard's, as a sign of
               reconciliation. he holds hers and caresses it.
          
               susan gets comfortable to try to sleep. she closes her eyes
               when suddenly something smashes the window and susan collapses
               forward.
          
               richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then susan.
          
                                     richard
                         susan, what's wrong?
          
                                                                           19.
          
               susan doesn't answer, limp on her seat.
          
                                     richard (cont'd)
                         what happened?
          
               richard lifts her up and when he does he sees a thread of
               blood run down her neck. richard yells at the driver.
          
                                     richard (cont'd)
                         stop the bus, stop, my wife's been
                         hurt.
