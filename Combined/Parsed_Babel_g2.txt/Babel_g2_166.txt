                amelia lumbers heavily, carrying debbie asleep on her arm.
                mike drags his feet a few yards behind.
          
                they walk for a long stretch through the thorny brush until
                they reach a small mound where a leafy mesquite grows.
          
                amelia lays a limp debbie down on the ground and sits on the
                mound of earth.
          
                                      amelia
                              (in spanish)
                          we're going to rest here for a while.
          
                                      mike
                          what if there are snakes?
          
                                      amelia
                          no, there aren't any.   come, lie
                          down.
          
                the boy, exhausted and docile, obeys and lies on her chest.
                amelia leans against the trunk with debbie on her legs. the
                children sleep while amelia, nodding off, tries to keep watch.
