          145   int. santiago's car -- night
          
                santiago drives the car, nodding off every now and then. in
                the back, debbie and mike have surrendered to sleep. santiago
                jerks the wheel.

                          hey... be careful...
          
                santiago corrects the vehicles trajectory and goes back to
                his careless driving.
