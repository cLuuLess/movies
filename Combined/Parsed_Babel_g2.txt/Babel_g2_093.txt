               abdullah takes two goats out of the corral, ties a rope to
               their neck and drags them over to a rock. the goats bleat
               desperately trying to break free.
          
               abdullah turns to look at his children.
          
                                      abdullah
                         hold them.
          
               yussef and ahmed hold their legs.   abdullah pulls out a knife
               and slits the goat's throat.
