          188   ext. hamlet -- evening
          
                the truck is parked in front of anwar's house. richard and
                susan wait in the back while the boy, anwar and the vet lean
                on the hood.
          
                suddenly a helicopter with american insignia flies over them
                and goes to land in an empty lot.
          
                anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. the
                helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze
                of dozens of children. some camels are frightened. some
                starving dogs bark at it.
