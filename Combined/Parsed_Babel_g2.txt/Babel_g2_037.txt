               ahmed and yussef run full speed, herding their goats as they
               go. some of them get left behind and yussef hurries back to
               them. as they climb a hill, he slips and falls, rolls
               downhill and drops the rifle, which slides a few meters away.
          
               ahmed runs to help him. yussef gets up, covered in dust and
               with a scratch on his forehead. ahmed picks up the rifle.
          
                                     ahmed
                         hurry up, man, hurry...
          
                                                                           25.
          
               ahmed runs off, hands flailing, to herd the straggling sheep.
               yussef follows him, limping.
