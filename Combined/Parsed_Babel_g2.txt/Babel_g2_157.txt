                                      rachel (o.s.)
                          mark, your business partner, already
                          called someone in the secretary of

                                       richard

                          fucking calls, you've got to do

                          everything we can.
          
                                                                     93.
          
                                richard
                    how the fuck do you expect me to
                    calm down? susan is dying...
          
                                rachel (o.s.)

                    out of here now! put mark on the
                    phone...
          
                                rachel (o.s.)
                    i don't know if i can find him.
          
                                richard
                    god damn it, connect the fucking
                    call.
          
          a few seconds go by. desperate, richard looks at the town as
          it goes about its daily business, oblivious to his tragedy.
          
                                mark (o.s.)
                    richard, it's mark.
          
                                richard
                    mark, help me... susan is dying and
                    there are no ambulances, there's no
                    hospital, there's nothing.
          
                                mark (o.s.)
                    richard, the news is all over the
                    place. they're going to go help you,
                    soon, but there have been some
                    political problems that are being
                    resolved.
          
                                richard
                    i don't give a shit about political
                    problems... do something, now,
                    please...
          
          through the window, richard, astonished, watches the bus
          drive away, kicking up dust as it disappears in the distance.
          
                                richard (cont'd)
                    son of a bitch...
          
          he throws the phone away and runs after the bus. we hear
          mark's desperate voice over the receiver.
          
                                 mark (o.s.)
                    richard... what happened? richard,
                    answer me...
          
                                                                                94.
