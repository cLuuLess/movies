               richard raises his head and sees the desolate environs.
          
                                        richard
                         are we here?
          
                                     anwar
                         yes sir, this is my house.
          
               richard tries to carry susan, but she screams in pain.
          
                                     richard
                         easy, darling, easy...
          
               he slips his hands under her and lifts her up.
          
                                     susan
                         don't touch me there.
          
                                                                         37.
          
               richard moves his hand, which is covered in blood. as he
               carries her, he turns into the aisle while anwar and one of
               the passengers try to help him.
