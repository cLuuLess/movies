          39   int. yussef and ahmed's house -- later
          
               yussef and ahmed are sitting on their mats, looking at each
               other, pale, scared and quiet. yasira walks in to see them,
               followed by her daughters. she turns to ahmed.
          
                                     yasira
                         what are you doing here?
          
               ahmed, livid, cannot answer.
          
                                     yussef
                         something we ate gave us a stomach
                         ache.
          
               yasira stares harshly at ahmed.
          
                                      yasira
                         and is that why you're insulting
                         your sister?
          
                                                                           26.
          
               ahmed looks at zora, then yussef, and then is silent.
          
                                     yussef
                         we were feeling really ill.
          
               yasira points toward the corral.
          
                                     yasira
                         the goats are going to feel even
                         worse if they don't eat. take them
                         out again.
          
                                     ahmed
                         our stomach really hurts.
          
                                     yasira
                         then start jerking the meat.
          
               yasira walks out.    yussef and zora exchange a look.
