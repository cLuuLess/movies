          35   int. bathroom, eve's -- day
          
               chieko leans on the sink while mitsu pees in one of the
               stalls. chieko is noticeably upset.
          
               mitsu walks out of the stall, fixing her skirt.   she sees
               chieko is distressed.
          
                                     mitsu
                             (in sign language)
                         what's the matter?
          
                                     chieko
                             (in sign language)
                         they look at us like we're monsters.
          
                                     mitsu
                         oh, come off it.
          
                                                                              24.
          
               chieko is at a loss for words. mitsu stares at her: it looks
               like another one of many tantrums.
          
               chieko hikes up her skirt and starts to pull down her panties.
          
                                     mitsu (cont'd)
                         what are you doing?
          
                                     chieko
                         now they're going to meet the real
                         hairy monster.
          
               she makes the gesture of sticking her finger up a hole, then
               goes to the toilet, throws her panties in and flushes. she
               turns to look at mitsu defiantly, who cannot help but laugh.
