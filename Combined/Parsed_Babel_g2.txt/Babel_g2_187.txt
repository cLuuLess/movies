                they carry susan to the helicopter in a stretcher. they
                load her in carefully. richard follows her through the wind
                generated by the helicopter. anwar catches up to them to say
                goodbye.
          
                                      anwar
                          good luck, mister...
          
                                      richard
                          thank you for everything.
          
                richard gives anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately.
                richard takes out his wallet and holds out three hundred-
                dollar bills, which anwar rejects.
          
                                      anwar
                          no sir, no... allah be with you.
          
                they look each other in the eye and then richard gets into
                the chopper. it takes off.
