          118   int. bus -- day
          
                the driver sits in the driver's seat and stares out at the
                desolate landscape through the windshield.
          
                several of the tourists nap in their seats. one of them, a
                french tourist, robert (70), starts to breathe with
                difficulty. jane (65), his wife, is alarmed.
          
                                                                      69.
          
                                jane
                        (in french)
                    are you ok?
          
          robert nods, but it is clear that he is not.    jane shouts at
          the driver.
          
                                jane (cont'd)
                        (in french)
                    could you please turn on the air
                    conditioning?
          
          the driver shakes his head regretfully.
          
                                driver
                        (in broken french)
                    no air condition, no gasoline near.
                    i'm sorry.
          
          robert inhales, he can barely breathe.
          
                                jane
                        (in french)
                    my husband is feeling ill.     you have
                    to turn it on.
          
                                driver
                        (in french)
                    no possible. no gasoline near.      i'm
                    sorry.
          
                                lilly
                        (in french)
                    please, it's too hot.   we can get
                    dehydrated.
          
                                driver
                        (in french)
                    i'm really sorry, forgive me, but
                    gasoline finish with air conditioner.
          
          tom turns to jane.
          
                                tom
                    what is he saying?
          
                                jane
                    that he can't turn on the air
                    conditioning, that it's not possible.
          
          tom stands up and goes to yell at the driver.
          
                                 tom
                    fuck you.   we're gettin' out of here.
          
                                                                               70.
