          32   ext. street, tokyo -- day
          
               yasujiro parks his car and chieko gets out.
          
                                     yasujiro
                             (in sign language)
                         don't forget you have the dentist at
                         four.
          
               chieko looks annoyed, and blows her father a kiss goodbye.
               as she is about to get out of the car, yasujiro grabs her
               arm. she turns to look at him.
          
                                                                            22.

                             (in sign language)
