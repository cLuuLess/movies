          187   ext. street, tijuana -- evening
          
                amelia smokes, drifting. after a while she sits on a sidewalk
                and leans on a post. she looks into the street at the people
                passing by and starts crying softly.
          
                a dusty and battered pick up truck arrives. inside are her
                son and her comadre. her son steps down and hugs her in
                silence as she cries. her comadre observes them from a
                distance.
