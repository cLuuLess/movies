          129   ext. yussef and ahmed's house -- day
          
                yussef and ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house.
                yussef's lip is split. ahmed's nose is bleeding.
          
                abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters
                watch the scene, silent. abdullah stops to look at yussef.
          
                                      abdullah
                          why did you do this?
          
                they don't answer.   abdullah leans over and slaps ahmed.
          
                                      abdullah (cont'd)
                          answer me, god damn it!
          
                ahmed won't answer and he turns to yussef again.
          
                                      yussef
                          we were testing the rifle.
          
                abdullah turns and gives yussef a powerful slap, which he
                endures with silent dignity.
          
                                      abdullah
                          are you idiots? you killed a woman,
                              (he turns to zora)
                          and you, you got naked so your brother
                          would see you?
          
                                      ahmed
                          yes, she got naked lots of times.    i
                          saw how yussef spied on her.
          
                                                                             75.
          
                                      zora
                          that's not true.
          
                abdullah turns to yussef.
          
                                      abdullah
                          is it true or not?
          
                yussef is silent. abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps
                zora. he looks furious, scared, indignant.
          
                                      abdullah (cont'd)
                          why did you do this to us?
          
                he can barely hold in his tears. zora brings her hand to
                her face tearily. abdullah turns to ahmed.
          
                                      abdullah (cont'd)
                          where's the rifle?
