                the illegal immigrants cross into mexico, where they disband
                into small groups. amelia walks alone. before she walks
                away she turns to one of the other deported mexicans.

                          do you have a cigarette?
          
                he acquiesces. he rummages through his pant pockets and
                pulls out a pack of cigarettes. he offers one to amelia, who
                takes it. he also pulls out some matches and lights one.
          
                                                                          115.
