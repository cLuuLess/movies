          9    ext. yussef and ahmed's house -- day
          
               yussef is still spying.    ahmed approaches.
          
                                     ahmed
                         what are you doing?
          
               yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.
          
                                     ahmed (cont'd)
                         i told you not to spy on her again.
          
               yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. ahmed pulls him
               by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. yussef falls
               on his ass.
          
                                     ahmed (cont'd)
                         i said don't spy on her.
          
               yussef gets up and dusts himself off.
          
                                     yussef
                         what the hell do you care?
          
                                     ahmed
                         come on, let's go.
          
               he turns around and leaves.
