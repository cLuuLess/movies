          88   ext. yussef and ahmed's house -- moments later
          
               dawn. the desert is a rose plain softly lit by the sun's
               first rays. yussef and ahmed are digging a hole with their
               bare hands. once they're finished, they clean up around the
               hole and mark it with three stones.
