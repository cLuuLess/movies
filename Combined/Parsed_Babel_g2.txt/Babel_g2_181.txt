          183   int. general store -- afternoon
          
                richard walks into the cubicle.    the phone is off the hook
                and richard answers.
          
                                      richard
                          hello...
          
                                      secretary (o.s.)
                          just a moment, i'm going to put you
                          through to ambassador ken clifford.
          
                richard awaits. in the corner of the room, he sees a goat's
                head covered with flies.
          
                                      ken
                          hello, richard jones?
          
                                      richard
                          yes, speaking.
          
                                      ken (o.s.)
                          i'm very sorry about what happened
                          to your wife, but you can be sure
                          that the culprits will be punished.
          
                                      richard
                          my wife is dying. she's in urgent
                          need of medical attention.
          
                                      ken (o.s.)
                          we're working on it...
          
                                                                          112.
          
                richard interrupts angrily.
          
                                      richard
                          we've been here for five hours.
                          what the fuck are you waiting for?
          
                                       ken (o.s.)
                          the moroccan government won't let us
                          use their airspace. they refused to
                          acknowledge that this was an act of
                          terrorism...
          
                                      richard
                          i can't wait anymore... i'm taking
                          my wife to a clinic in tinerhir right
                          now...
          
                                      ken (o.s.)
                          stay put... we've settled the matter.
                          a helicopter should arrive soon...
          
                                      richard
                          we can't wait any longer.
          
                                      ken (o.s.)
                          the helicopter is on its way. don't
                          move.
          
                                      richard
                          my wife is in critical condition.
                          how long is the chopper going to
                          take?
          
                                      ken (o.s.)
                          soon... it'll be there soon... be
                          patient, it won't be long.
