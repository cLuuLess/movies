          40   int. yussef and ahmed's house -- day
          
               yussef and ahmed are jerking a couple of young goats with
               very sharp knives. they set the thin strips on newspaper.
          
               they look nervous.    they talk in whispers.
          
                                     ahmed
                         d'you think something happened?
          
                                     yussef
                         i don't know.
          
                                     ahmed
                         people were screaming.
          
               they are silent for a long while.
          
                                     ahmed (cont'd)
                         it was your fault.
          
               yussef stares at him in disbelief.
          
                                      yussef
                         it was both our faults. we both
                         shot.
                             (a beat)
                         swear to me you'll never say anything.
          
               ahmed won't answer. yussef looks around the room to make
               sure nobody is listening to them.
          
                                        yussef (cont'd)
                         swear.     nobody, never.
          
               ahmed remains pensive.    he sighs and answers.
          
                                                                            27.
          
                                      ahmed
                         i swear.   nobody.
