          90   ext. mountain range -- morning
          
               alarid squats, scrutinizing the four empty cartridges lying
               on the earth. one of his men approaches and alarid signals
               with his hand for him to stop immediately.
          
                                                                            53.
          
                                     alarid
                         stop right there...
          
               the man remains motionless. alarid follows the prints that
               lead away from the cartridges. he reaches the mess of goat
               hoof-prints. he picks up a ball of shit and feels it.
          
                                     alarid (cont'd)
                         they're from around here. find out
                         who has a .270 caliber rifle.
