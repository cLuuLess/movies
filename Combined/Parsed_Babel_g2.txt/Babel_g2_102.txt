          102   ext. chicken coop -- day
          
                the chickens walk around a rustic chicken coop made with
                wire mesh and mesquite posts. santiago opens the door to
                the coop and lets the kids in, mike and debbie among them.
                once inside, santiago tells them to catch the chickens.
          
                                      santiago
                              (in spanish)
                          i'll give ten pesos to the first one
                          of you who catches a chicken.
          
                the kids start chasing the chickens, which scamper as soon
                as they feel hands trying to grab them.
          
                at first, mike and debbie don't know what to do, but they
                are soon amused and run to catch them. after a while, debbie
                catches one and holds it up.
          
                santiago applauds her.
          
                                      santiago (cont'd)
                          debbie is the winner. now we need
                          another five.
          
                the kids get back to their game of catching chickens.
