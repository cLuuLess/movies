          110   int. patricia's room -- day
          
                patricia, in her bridal dress and clearly six months pregnant,
                is sitting on her bed with her hands around her belly, with
                her mother, father and entire family around her.
          
                                                                             62.
          
                                      patricia
                              (both in spanish)
                          my belly's been hard since the
                          morning.
          
                                      amelia
                          that happens when you're nervous.
          
                                      madre
                          d'you think the baby's coming?
          
                                      amelia
                          there's no way the baby's coming;
                          she's only six months pregnant.
          
                                      patricia
                          but my belly feels hard, really hard.
          
                                      amelia
                          d'you want to get married?
          
                                       patricia
                          yes.
          
                                      amelia
                          well, let's go then.
          
                                      madre
                          and what if the baby comes out?
          
                                      amelia
                          well, we'll have the wedding and
                          baptize the kid while we're at it.
