          94   ext. hassan's house -- day
          
               hassan lies on the floor, cuffed, with a broken mouth,
               surrounded by cops. alarid is carrying out the interrogation,
               squatting next to hassan's face.
          
                                     alarid
                         why did you shoot at the bus?
          
                                     hassan
                         i didn't shoot at anyone.
          
                                     alarid
                         then who, you idiot?
          
               hassan remains silent and turns to look at his wife who is
               sitting on a chair, cuffed, a few yards away.
          
                                                                             55.
          
                                     hassan
                         it wasn't me.
          
               alarid punches him in the face.
          
                                     alarid
                         that was your rifle.
          
                                     hassan
                         no, not anymore, i sold it today.
          
                                      alarid
