          96   ext. desert -- day
          
               as they climb a hill, they encounter a convoy of moroccan
               police trucks. they are terrified. the vehicles screech to
               a dramatic halt before them, lifting up much dust.
          
               alarid opens the passenger window.
          
                                     alarid
                         hey, do you know where abdullah adboum
                         lives?
          
               ahmed and yussef exchange a glance.   yussef nods.
          
                                      yussef
                         yes.
          
               ahmed gets very nervous.   yussef points the wrong way with
               an air of certainty.
          
                                     yussef (cont'd)
                         over there, you have to cross those
                         mountains.
          
                                     alarid
                         they told us he lived around here.
          
                                     yussef
                         no, we just live here with our mother.
                         abdullah lives over there.
          
               alarid scrutinizes the brothers' faces.
          
                                                                              56.
          
                                     alarid
                         if you're lying to me i'm going to
                         come back and cut your balls off.
          
               ahmed breathes nervously.    yussef continues in cold blood.
          
                                     yussef
                         you can come back whenever you like.
          
               alarid smiles and gestures at the driver with his head that
               they should go on. the police vehicles drive off in the
               direction yussef pointed them in.
