          30   int. locker room, volleyball court -- day
          
               chieko sits on a bench in her underwear. she looks aggravated
               and absorbed in her own thoughts. her other teammates get
               dressed. two of them walk past wrapped in towels, freshly
               showered, and stand in front of her. they talk to each other
               in sign language.
          
                                     teammate 1
                         you shouldn't have lost your temper.
                         we lost the game.
          
                                     chieko
                         it wasn't my fault, it was the ref.
          
                                     teammate 2
                         if you hadn't been thrown out, we
                         would've won the game.
          
               chieko, angry, gets up and starts to rummage through her
               locker. her teammate walks over and gets her attention.
          
                                     teammate 1
                         why are you in a bad mood?
          
               chieko doesn't answer.    teammate 2 approaches.
          
                                     teammate 2
                         she's always in a bad mood because
                         nobody's fucked her yet.
          
               she caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers chieko.
          
                                     chieko
                         i'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid
                         of my mood.
          
               teammate 1 laughs, amused. teammate 2 gives chieko a scornful
               look. chieko smiles sardonically.
          
                                                                            21.
