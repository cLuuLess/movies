          25   ext. bus -- moments later
          
               the tourists crowd around to board the bus. some boys in
               rags approach to sell them trinkets.
          
                                     boys
                         stilo...stilo...
          
                                                                            18.
          
               some of the tourists buy them. they come to susan, who
               becomes instantly uncomfortable. she gestures with her hand
               to say they have no money, but the kids insist.
          
                                     boys (cont'd)
                         stilo...stilo...
          
                                     susan
                         i don't have any money... i don't
                         have any...
          
               richard takes off his binoculars and gives them to the
               youngest of the boys (7), who receives them with wide eyes.
          
                                     richard
                         here.
          
                                     susan
                         what are you doing?
          
               richard just gets in the bus. susan stares at the boy with
               the binoculars for a moment and then gets in.
