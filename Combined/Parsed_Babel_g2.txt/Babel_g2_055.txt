          55   ext. desert highway -- day
          
               no cars drive by. the road is almost deserted. in the
               distance, a run-down renault approaches. richard stands in
               the road to stop it.
          
               the car brakes and richard runs toward the driver: an old
               peasant traveling with his eight year-old grandson.
          
                                     richard
                         i need your help. we were attacked.
          
                                     old man
                             (in arabic)
                         i don't understand...
          
               richard grows desperate.
          
                                     richard
                         help... hospital...
          
                                     old man
                             (in arabic)
                         i don't understand you sir.
          
               richard sees that anwar and the bus driver have gotten out
               of the bus and he starts shouting at them for help.
          
                                     richard
                         tell him we need his help.
          
               with the distraction, the old man drives off. richard watches
               helplessly as they drive away and he grabs anwar by the arm.
          
                                     richard (cont'd)
                         let's take her to the clinic.
          
                                                                            35.
