          24   ext. small eatery, moroccan desert -- later
          
               the group of tourists spread about a small eatery with open
               air tables on a dusty terrace. a bus is parked behind them.
          
               at a table, on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster
               of mountains, richard and susan look through some menus.
               richard seems at ease in this place. susan appears to be
               bothered by the dust and otherness.
          
               a waiter brings a plate and some cutlery.
          
                                     waiter
                             (in broken english)
                         you want to order?
          
                                     richard
                         i'll have a chicken cous-cous and a
                         coke, please.
          
                                     susan
                         what do you have that doesn't have
                         fat in it?
          
                                     waiter
                         everything is delicious.
          
                                                                      16.
          
          susan reads the menu again.
          
                                susan
                    i'll have the fried eggplant and a
                    diet coke.
          
                                waiter
                    we don't have diet coke.
          
                                susan
                    then a regular coke.
          
          the waiter smiles and goes to place the order. susan takes
          out a small bottle with antibacterial gel, cleans her hands
          and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly.
          
          richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of
          binoculars. he spots a hawk flying over the plains.
          
                                richard
                    look, look: a hawk.
          
          richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds
          and then puts them down.
          
                                richard (cont'd)
                    this country is incredible.
          
          susan remains silent and then turns to look at him.
          
                                susan
                    richard, why did we come here?
          
                                richard
                    what d'you mean why? i thought you
                    would like it.
          
                                susan
                    really: why are we here?
          
          richard knows that susan's answer implies something else.
          
                                richard
                    to forget everything, to be alone.
          
          susan, sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with
          her chin.
          
                                susan
                    alone?
          
          richard sighs in disappointment. the waiter arrives with
          the cokes and the food, which does not look particularly
          appetizing. he leaves everything on the table and goes.
          
          richard is about to pour his drink when susan stops him.
          
                                                                          17.
          
                                     susan (cont'd)
                         throw out the ice.
          
                                     richard
                         the coke is warm.
          
                                     susan
                         yeah, but you don't know what kind
                         of water is in there.
          
               she grabs richard's glass and tosses out the ice. then she
               does the same thing with hers. they are quiet for a moment.
          
                                     richard
                         why can't you ever relax.    you're
                         always stressed.
          
                                     susan
                         you're the one stressing me out.
                         you're why i can't relax.
          
                                     richard
                         you could if you tried.
          
                                     susan
                         tried? don't you think i tried?
          
                                     richard
                         you're never going to forgive me,
                         are you?
          
                                     susan
                         do you even know what i'm talking
                         about?
          
                                     richard
                         susan, please; we didn't come all
                         this way just to argue.
          
               susan gets angry and faces him.
          
                                     susan
                         oh, we didn't? then when are we
                         supposed to "argue"? or are you
                         planning on running away again?
          
               richard sighs, defeated. they stop speaking and sit looking
               at the mountains.
