          97   ext. yussef and ahmed's house -- day
          
               ahmed and yussef run home. their mother and sisters are
               milking some goats into a tin bucket. when they fill, abdullah
               empties the milk out into a barrel.
          
                                     ahmed
                         papa... papa...
          
               abdullah puts the bucket down on the floor and turns to look
               at his kids, who stop before him, panting, exhilarated.
          
                                     abdullah
                         what happened?
          
               ahmed can barely control his gasping.
          
                                     ahmed
                         the police... they're looking for
                         you...
          
                                        abdullah
                         me?    why?
          
                                     yussef
                         no, they're not looking for you...
                         they're looking for us...
          
                                        abdullah
                         you?    why?
          
                                     yussef
                         because of what happened to the
                         tourist...
          
               yasira and her two daughters stop milking and approach.
               abdullah can't seem to understand what their talking about.
          
                                     abdullah
                         what tourist?
          
                                     ahmed
                         the american... yussef killed her...
          
                                                                            57.
          
                                     yussef
                         that's not true, we both did.
          
                                     yasira
                         what are you saying?
          
               ahmed fires his words out.
          
                                     ahmed
                         yussef started shooting at the cars
                         because hassan said that the bullet
                         could go really far...
          
                                      yussef
                         that's a lie, you started shooting
                         at the cars.
          
                                     ahmed
                         yes, but you killed her.
          
               abdullah loses his patience and grabs ahmed by the shoulders.
          
                                     abdullah
                         what the hell are you talking about?
          
               ahmed looks at his father straight in the eyes.
          
                                     ahmed
                         yussef killed the american and he
                         spies on zora naked and zora lets
                         him watch her...
          
               abdullah turns toward zora.   in his mind, everything is
               confusion.
          
                                     abdullah
                         what is your brother talking about?
          
                                     zora
                         that's bullshit.
          
                                     ahmed
                         it's not bullshit; she's a whore and
                         my brother spies on her...
          
               as soon as the words leave ahmed's mouth, yussef decks him
               and leaves him sprawled on the dust.
          
               ahmed shoots right back up and runs at yussef kicking, until
               they're both entangled in the fight and end up rolling on
               the ground. abdullah tries to get between them.
