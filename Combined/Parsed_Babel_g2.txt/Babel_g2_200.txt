          201   ext. balcony, chieko's apartment -- night
          
                from the balcony, naked, chieko observes the city stretching
                before her.
          
                yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely
                naked. there are still traces of chieko's tears in her eyes.
          
                yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this,
                but says nothing. he slowly walks toward her. chieko looks
                hurt, but whole.
          
                yasujiro stands beside her. they look at each other. chieko
                holds out her hand and takes his. chieko squeezes. she looks
                at the city and then looks at her father's eyes.
          
                he strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony, with
                the massive city sprawling under them.
