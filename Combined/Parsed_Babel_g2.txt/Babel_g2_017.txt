          17   int. kitchen, l.a. house -- day
          
               debbie (4) and mike (5) are having breakfast while amelia
               leans on the sink and looks at them, overwhelmed.
          
                                     amelia
                             (to debbie, in spanish)
                         do you want another quesadilla?
          
                                       debbie
                         mhh.
          
               amelia turns around to warm up a tortilla. mike stops eating
               his cereal and looks at her.
          
                                                                          12.
          
                                     mike
                         how many little birds did the hawk
                         eat?
          
               amelia turns around and sees mike, who is truly worried.
          
                                      amelia
                             (in english)
                         none, because he started to like
                         quesadillas.
          
               amelia strokes his hair. a car horn honks. amelia looks
               out and sees a school bus parked outside the house.
          
                                     debbie
                         is the bus here?
          
                                     amelia
                             (in spanish)
                         yes, but today you're not going to
                         school.
          
                                       debbie
                         why?
          
                                     amelia
                         we have things to do.
          
               amelia turns around and walks out to the street. through
               the door we can see her saying something to the bus driver.
               the school bus leaves and amelia walks back into the house.
