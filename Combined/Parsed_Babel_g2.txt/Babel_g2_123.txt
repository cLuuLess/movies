          123   ext. park, tokyo -- day
          
                they arrive at a park with a playground: swings, see-saws,
                slides. several of their deaf-mute volleyball friends are
                there.
          
                with them are two young men with hair dyed blond. one of
                them, takeshi (18), has an earring, and the other, haruki
                (19), has several tattoos.
          
                mitsu and chieko greet them in sign language.    chieko asks
                the slightly chubby kumiko who they are.
          
                                      kumiko
                          they're my cousins.
          
                chieko turns to look at them, curious. haruki, the guy with
                tattoos, exchanges a look with her. chieko suddenly feels
                intimidated and looks down.
          
                                      chieko
                          is he deaf-mute like us?
          
                                      kumiko
                          no, but he understands some.
          
                haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in
                to whisper something to takeshi, his brother. they both
                laugh.
          
                haruki approaches chieko and talks to her face to face so
                she can read his lips.
          
                                                                                 72.
          
                                      haruki
                          what's your name?
          
                chieko and her friend smile.    chieko takes out her notebook
                and pen and writes her name.    haruki reads it out loud.
          
                                         haruki (cont'd)
                          chieko?
          
                chieko nods.
          
                                      haruki (cont'd)
                          my name's haruki.
          
                chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. haruki takes
                out a flask and holds it out to her. chieko opens it and
                smells it. haruki stands in front of her.
          
                                         haruki (cont'd)
                          it's whisky.
          
                chieko smiles and gives a long swig.       mitsu asks for some
                and also gives it a long drink.
          
                                      haruki (cont'd)
                          do the cops come around here?
          
                                      mitsu
                              (gutturally)
                          sometimes.
          
                haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. mitsu
                and chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp
                of whisky.
