          38   ext. yussef and ahmed's house -- later
          
               the brothers make it back home. agitated, they put the goats
               back into their corral. zora walks out and approaches them.
          
                                     zora
                         what's wrong?
          
               yussef, busy closing the corral gate, pays no attention.
               ahmed, breathing agitatedly, doesn't answer.
          
                                     zora (cont'd)
                         i asked you what's wrong.
          
               ahmed, full of adrenaline, glances angrily at her.
          
                                     ahmed
                         what do you care, whore?
          
               yussef gets in the way.
          
                                     yussef
                         don't talk to her like that.
          
               yussef steps up to defend her, but ahmed spins around and
               goes into the house. yussef turns to zora.
          
                                     yussef (cont'd)
                         something we ate make us sick so we
                         came back.
          
               without another word, yussef also goes into the house.
