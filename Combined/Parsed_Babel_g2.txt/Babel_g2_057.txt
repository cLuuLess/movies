          57   int. bus -- day
          
               the bus rattles along. richard huddles over susan, trying to
               stop the blood flowing from her neck. barth, an old man starts
               shouting.
          
                                     barth
                         marrakech isn't this way. they're
                         going to shoot at us again.
          
                                     richard
                         we've got to get her to a hospital.
          
                                     barth
                         they're going to kill us all. turn
                         back... turn the bus around...
          
               richard gets exasperated at the old man's screaming.
          
                                     richard
                         shut up, god damn it!
          
               barth shuts up and the bus drives on.
