          72   int. general store -- day
          
               richard is in a small cubicle dialing on an old cream-colored
               rotary phone while anwar waits discretely in a corner. dozens
               of people watch from outside. richard turns to look at them
               while the call connects.
          
                                     richard
                         yes... rachel? it's richard...
          
                                     rachel (o.s.)
                         Â¿are you still in moroccco?
          
                                     richard
                         yes, we're still in morocco...rachel,
                         there was an accident, your sister
                         was shot...
          
                                     rachel (o.s.)
                             (surprised)
                         what? who shot her?
          
                                     richard
                         i don't know... we were shot at from
                         some hills.
          
                                      rachel
                         is she ok?
          
                                     richard
                         she was hit in her neck and shoulder.
                         rachel, she's not doing well... i
                         need you to tell the embassy as soon
                         as possible... wait... and call
                         mark...
          
                                     rachel (o.s.)
                         where are you?
          
               he turns to anwar.
          
                                     richard
                         anwar, where are we?
          
                                     anwar
                         in tazarine, three hours southwest
                         of erfoud.
          
                                     richard

                         three hours southwest of erfoud...
                         in the desert... it's a town...
                         there's no hospital... there's nothing
                         here at all...
          
                                     rachel (o.s.)
                         where are you calling me from?
          
                                                                            42.
          
                                     richard
                         from a shop. rachel, this is urgent...
                         urgent... call the embassy... they
                         have to help us... call james too...
          
                                     rachel (o.s.)
                         why did they shoot her?
          
                                     richard
                         i don't know... rachel, you're
                         sister's badly hurt... do you
                         understand? call for help... now...
          
               he hangs up. as soon as he does, he turns to anwar.
          
                                     richard (cont'd)
                         call an ambulance...
          
                                     anwar
                         i'll call erfoud so they send one
                         over.
          
               anwar, clumsy and stressed at richard's desperation, takes
               the phone and starts dialing.
          
                                     richard
                         and find a doctor...
          
               as he finishes dialing, anwar turns to richard.
          
                                     anwar
                         they've already gone to look for
                         him.
