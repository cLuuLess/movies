                kenji sits in a half-empty bar.   he turns to the bartender.
          
                                      kenji
                          another whisky.
          
                the t.v. has been turned on to a japanese newscast. kenji
                takes out chieko's note, reads it and, as soon as he is done,
                closes his eyes. he looks around. everybody seems to be
                immersed in a world far from his own.
          
                a reporter appears on t.v.
          
                                      reporter
                          susan jones, the american woman
                          wounded in an attack in morocco ten
                          days ago, left the hospital today,
                          heading to the united states...
          
                susan appears on screen in a wheelchair pushed by a male
                nurse and followed by richard.
          
                the bartender leans over to kenji.
          
                                      bartender
                          do you want something to eat?    i
                          could make you a sandwich.
          
                                      kenji
                          no thank you.
          
                when he looks back at the news, the story has changed.   kenji
                drinks his whisky parsimoniously.
          
                                                                         123.
