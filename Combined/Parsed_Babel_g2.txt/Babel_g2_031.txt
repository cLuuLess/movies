          31   int. yasujiro's car -- day
          
               yasujiro drives while chieko looks at the swarming tokyo
               streets. she is wearing a skirt revealing of her long
               volleyball legs.
          
               her fathers speaks to her in sign language.
          
                                     yasujiro
                         what do you want to eat?
          
                                     chieko
                         i said i'd meet my friends from the
                         team at eve's.
          
                                     yasujiro
                         weren't we going to have lunch
                         together?
          
                                     chieko
                         dad, i told you i was going to eat
                         with them, but you never pay attention
                         to me.
          
               yasujiro shakes his head in disapproval.
          
                                     chieko (cont'd)
                         my mother always paid attention to
                         me.
          
                                     yasujiro
                         why do you want to fight?
          
               they don't say anything else.   the traffic is chaotic.
          
                                     yasujiro (cont'd)
                         i miss your mother too.
          
               chieko just looks at him.
          
                                     yasujiro (cont'd)
                         i'm doing what i can, sweetie.
          
               they don't say anything else.   the traffic is chaos.
