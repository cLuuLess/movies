89  ext.   lorry						late afternoon 89
	
	sam climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on
	jill. he ends up standing next to a rusty kodak photospot
	standard. the picture on it - though faded by pollution -
	is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
	the murk and mess of the power plant. jill has made her
	way over to a rather shadowy figure lurking around the
	corner of one of the metal structures. they appear to be
	exchanging parcels. sam is worried by this suspicious
	behaviour - reinforced as it is by a ministry poster on
	the side of the building that illustrates, almost
	identically, the action we have just seen along with the
	warning: "mind that parcel. eagle eyes can save a life".
	
	cut to the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry.
