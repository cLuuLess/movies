112 int.   sam's office				  evening	  112
	
	sam recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
	desk in his office. he is bruised and battered and has a
	black eye. his suit is torn and bloody. mr warren is
	gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.
	behind warren, crowding the doorway, are the people who
	circulate around him and are the cast of the warren high
	energy circus. lime is with them.
	
					   warren
			this is a black eye for the
			department, lowry! ... and i don't
			care how you behaved when you were at
			records! information retrieval is an
			executive branch! we're proud of our
			reputation and we protect it!
	
	one of his accolytes thrusts a paper into his hand - he
	glances at it.
	
			damn it, lowry, that convoy of troop
			carriers is still not accounted for
			... i thought i told you to deal with
			it.
	
	he slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
	other forms.
	
			and what the hell is this mess? an
			empty desk is an efficient desk.
	
	he has picked up some of the forms.
	
			good god! ... queries from security,
			searches from central banking about a
			cheque, clarification notices from
			accounting concerning unreturned
			receipts, another demand from the
			motor pool.
	
						sam
			mr warren ... i have to find out
			about ...
						 
					   warren
			shut up! i don't know what's going on
			here, lowry, but don't think you can
			intimidate us with your friends and
			relatives in high places! now shape
			up!
	
	he dumps the papers and folders onto sam's desk and storms
	off with his entourage, leaving a gleeful lime in the
	doorway.
	
						sam
				(grabbing lime as he starts
				to slip away)
			lime, i need to use your computer
	
						lime
			sorry, a bit busy at the moment.
				(he indicates sam's
				smothered desk)
			you seem to have quite a lot to do
			yourself.
				(he disappears into his
				office)

corridor   day						 112a
	
	sam rushes out of his office after lime. but, lime has
	locked his door. sam bangs on the door.
	
						sam
			shit!
	
	
112b	  int.						sam's office   day112b
	
	sam storms back into his office. reaching a peak of
	frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the
	pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. within
	seconds it returns. sam sends it off a second time. it
	doesn't return a second time, periodically something
	passes through the tubes causing them to move. sam's
	pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.
	at this point sam's desk begins, as before, to creep
	through the wall. he grabs it violently. he pulls it.
	there is a scream from the other side of the wall. sam
	smiles. th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and
	then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside sam's
	office door. it shakes the whole building. sam goes to his
	door and opens it.
