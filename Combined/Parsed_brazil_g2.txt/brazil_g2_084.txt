	jill's lorry starts down one of the "streets".
	
						jill
				(as they pass a clock in
				"c"s)
			look at that - right on time.
	
						sam
			what? i thought you were free to come
			and go as you please.
	
						jill
			well, almost ... unfortunately i do
			have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
	
						sam
				(slightly surprised)
			every day?
	
						sam
			turn around!
	
						jill
			what?
	
						sam
			they'll be there waiting.
	
						jill
			who will?
	
						sam
			security.
	
						jill
			you're joking.
	
						sam
			no. please. they're going to arrest
			you.
	
						jill
			i thought you arrested me.
	
						sam
			yes ... but, this is real. now, stop!
				(he grabs for the emergency
				brake)
	
						jill
				(pushing his hand away)
			cut it out, sam.
	
						sam
				(grabbing at the steering
				wheel)
			will you please turn back.
	
						jill
				(shoving him back)
			get away!
	
						sam
				(lunging for the steering
				wheel)
			turn!
	
						jill
				(unable to control him)
			stop it ... damn you!
	
	sam throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid.
