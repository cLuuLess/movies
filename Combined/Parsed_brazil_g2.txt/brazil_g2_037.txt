	sam charges out into the open air. jill has disappeared.
	the messerchmidt, however, is in flames. sam doesn't know
	which way to turn. spotting an old mattress lying by the
	building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
	attempt to smother the flames. the group of children watch
	him silently. suddenly with a great roar, jill's lorry
	comes round the corner at speed. sam sees that jill is at
	the wheel. sam runs after the lorry.
	
						sam
				(shouting)
			wait! it was nothing to do with me!
	
	the lorry roars away. sam dashes back to his smoldering
	three-wheeler. he flings himself into it and starts it up.
	he also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
	three wheels have been removed. he turns round in despair
	and sees the group of children regarding him
	expressionlessly.
	
	they include the little girl buttle.
	
	defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. a
	shadow passes across his face. looking up he sees girl
	buttle standing over him.
	
						sam
			go away.
	
					 girl buttle
			her name is jill.
	
						sam
			what? ...jill? jill who? jill who?
	
					 girl buttle
			layton.
	
						sam
			jill layton ...
				(getting up)
			you're a very good little girl. what
			are you doing here?
	
					 girl buttle
			i'm waiting for my daddy.
	
						sam
				(uncomprehending)
			he will be pleased when he comes
			home.
	
	girl buttle doesn't answer and sam starts to walk away.
	after a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
	to look at the little girl buttle who stands alone
	patiently in the vandalised wilderness.
