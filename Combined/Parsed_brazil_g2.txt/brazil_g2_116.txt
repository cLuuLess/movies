	the screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing
	about a beautiful blue sky. they course this way and that.
	pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
	mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.
	the absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
	sam sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.
	he is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
	far below him the grey prisoners gather beaming with
	happiness. diving back to the ground - sam unsheaths his
	sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
	the great columns. the forces of darkness who have been
	lurking in the shadows slink back. sam, with one mighty
	swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
	cracks begin to race up and through the column. it is
	disintegrating. as it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
	topple. everyone steps back. down it plummets. and smashes
	into a million pieces. the bright blue sky escapes in all
	directions. the grey prisoners' iron collars and chains
	fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a
	beautiful blue sky. they look up to the sun. sam is
	exultant.
