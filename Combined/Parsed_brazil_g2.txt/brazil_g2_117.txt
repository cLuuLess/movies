129 int.   mother's bedroom			   dawn		129
	
	pull back from the sun through a window. the light falls
	on sam's smiling sleeping face. showly he wakes. he little
	by little remembers where he is and reaches over for jill.
	she isn't there. sam panics.
	
						jill
			merry xmas.
	
	she is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him. she
	crawls over to him - they start to embrace.
	
						sam
			everything is going to be all right.
	
	but crash !!! it's a raid! like a giant drill a whirling
	cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of
	mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole
	in the buttle ceiling ... cuts show doors being burst open
	by security troops. jill and sam are frozen in panic.
	security troops are sliding down a fireman's pole" from
	the hole in the ceiling.
	
						sam
				(shouts)
			she's dead. check the list!
	
	but it is sam they have come for. he is being dragged out
	of the bed.
	
					   guards
				(as they struggle with him)
			you turncoat bastard! judas!!
			traitor!!
	
	a canvas bag is plunged over his head. all goes black.
	
						sam
				(muffled)
			jill!!!
	
	a shot rings out. jill screams. it echoes through the
	blackness.
