63  int.   corridor					 day		   63
	
	cut to sam coming out of his office, turning right and
	walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads:
	officer dv/048.
	
	as is his custom, sam opens the door without knocking.
	
	
63a int.   lime's office				 day		  63a
	
	cut to sam's pov. here is an office much like his. it's
	the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall.
	the other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
	round-headed little junior executive wholly occupied with
	trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. he
	is unaware of sam.
	
						sam
			hello.
	
	lime startled, lets go of his desk and vents his
	irritation on sam whom he mistakes for someone else.
	
						lime
			no, you can't have any more chairs!
			there's only one left in here now,
			and i need that to sit on!
				(realizing his mistake)
			oh ... er, sorry. who are you?
	
						sam
			sam lowry.
	
						lime
				(becoming unctuous)
			ah, yes, you're the new boy from next
			door, ha ha!
				(he advances toward sam
				with hand out to shake.
				shaking hands)
			my name's lime. harvey lime. welcome
			to expediting.
	
						sam
			ah.
				(he pauses - looking
				around)
			would you mind if i borrowed your
			computer console?
	
						lime
			what?
	
						sam
			i'll bring it back in ten minutes.
	
						lime
			you want to take my console into your
			office?
	
						sam
			yes.
	
						lime
				(after a moment's
				consideration)
			i'll tell you what .... you tell me
			what and i'll do it for. i'm a bit of
			a whizz on this thing.
				(indicates computer
				console)
	
	sam hesitates, but sees that there's no other way.
	
						sam
				(taking print-out on jill
				from his pocket)
			alright. there's someone i want to
			check out. a woman called gillian
			layton.
	
						lime
				(leering)
			a woman eh? i see.
	
						sam
				(trying to ignore this)
			i know her age and distinguishing
			marks. but i need an address or a
			place of work or something
	
						lime
				(continuing to leer)
			this is your dream girl, is it?
	
						sam
				(taken aback)
			what?
				(recovering)
			look, let me use the console for a
			few minutes.
	
						lime
				(trying to be jocular)
			you must be joking -
				(entirely unconvincing)
			when there's a woman involved -
			there's no stopping me. now, let me
			have that sheet.
	
	he takes jill's print-out sheet from sam and begins to
	punch the keys laboriously with one finger. nothing
	happens.
	
						lime
			sod it, it's broken!
	
						sam
			you haven't switched it on.
	
						lime
			oh - yes. look you're putting me off,
			standing there! go back to your
			office and i'll give you a knock when
			i've finished.
	
	sam hesitates, but goes.
	
						lime
			go on. i'm not going to elope with
			her.
	
	sam exits.
