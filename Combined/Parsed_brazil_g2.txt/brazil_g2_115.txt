127 int.   mother's flat				 night		127
	
	sam enters the flat. jill is nowhere to be seen. the
	lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door
	beams a shaft of bright light. music pours forth ... it is
	"brazil".
	
						sam
				(cautiously)
			jill?
	
	getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.
	there is jill but, transformed. she is wearing one of
	sam's mother's wigs which billows in the air blown by a
	fan. she is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed
	from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. she
	looks like the dream girl. sam stands open-mouthed. jill
	notices him and smiles.
	
						jill
			what do you think? ... is it me?
	
						sam
				(still stunned)
			you don't exist any more. i've killed
			you. jill layton is dead.
	
	he holds out a print-out. she reads it and slowly looks
	up.
	
						jill
			care for a bit of necrophilia?
	
	they rush together.
