	sam presses the button for the 50th floor. the lift doors
	close on him and the charlady. from somewhere far away
	there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. sam glances
	around the lift. there appears to be an air conditioning
	vent in the ceiling.
	
	sam glances enquiringly at the charlady who merely smiles
	at him. another scream is heard.
	
						sam
			what's that?
	
	the charlady smiles again.
	
			doesn't that disturb you?
	
	the charlady fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
	out a pair of wax earplugs.
	
					  charlady
			beg your pardon?
	
	the lift arrives.
