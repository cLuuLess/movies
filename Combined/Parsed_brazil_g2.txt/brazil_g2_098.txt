108 int.   lingerie department/shopping centre			108
	
	to the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
	sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. as we
	slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
	exotic occasions we come upon sam and jill pushing a
	shopping trolley. in the trolley is the "suspicious"
	parcel which jill was given at the power plant.
	
						sam
			this is a hell of a time to buy a
			nightie.
	
						jill
			are you still following me?
	
						sam
			please, jill ... i love you.
	
						jill
			go away.
	
						sam
			there are plenty of other safe
			places. why don't we go back to my
			flat?
	
						jill
			leave me alone!
	
						sam
			you've got to trust me. it sounds
			silly but i know we were meant to
			meet.
	
						jill
			you mean you were meant to hijack my
			truck, make me crash it, and have
			every security man in town looking
			for me?
	
						sam
			i vas just trying to help. i decided
			to trust you. maybe i was wrong.
			whose side are you on really? who are
			your friends? who was the man who
			gave you the parcel? what's in it?
			it's the only thing you saved from
			the lorry .... it must he something
			very special.
	
						jill
			i saved you from the lorry and you're
			not very special.
	
						sam
			........... it's a bomb isn't it?
	
						jill
				(exasperated)
			oh ... jesus!
	
	sam grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start
	tearing it open.
	
						sam
			i'm going to open it!
	
						jill
				(grabbing parcel and trying
				to take it from him)
			no you're not!
	
	they start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. sam's
	suit gets slightly ripped. their tug-of-war is interrupted
	by a voice off camera.
	
						voice
			sam!!
	
	sam turns to see mrs terrain and shirley a short distance
	away. mrs terrain is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
	wheelchair which shirley is pushing.
	
					 mrs terrain
			it's me and shirley!
	
	from the terrains' pov sam looks as if he is wrestling
	with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
	length mirror. the mirror or something obscures jill. mrs
	terrain and shirley exchange puzzled looks and proceed
	toward sam.
	
						sam
			ah ... hello, mrs terrain. sam lets
			go of the parcel and pushes jill
			away. she moves off.
	
						sam
				(after jill for mrs
				terrain's benefit)
			i think that'll hold it.
				(to shirley)
			hello shirley. just helping someone
			tie up a christmas present. how are
			you?
	
					 mrs terrain
			my complication had a complication,
			but dr chapman says i'll soon be up
			and bouncing about like a young
			gazelle. are you buying a christmas
			present for your mother?
	
						sam
				(trying to keep an eye on
				jill who is disappearing
				from sight)
			er, yes ...
	
					 mrs terrain
			shirley and i come here regularly. i
			love romantic lingerie.
	
	she unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things
	with strategic holes in them.
	
					 mrs terrain
				(coyly)
			picture me in these.
	
	at this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
	corner of the store. it is the corner that we last saw
	jill moving towards. sam races towards the smoke, dust
	covering his suit. he finds bras, knickers, broken shop
	dummies, bleeding customers and shop assistants all over
	the place. on the edge of this devastated area he sees
	jill struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
	plaster dust. he rushes over to her.
	
						sam
					  (frantic)
			are you alright?
						jill
			yes.
	
						sam
				(anxiety giving way to
				anger)
			you don't deserve to be! you should
			be dead, or maimed like them .... how
			could you ...?
				(indicating the wounded)
			what a bloody stupid thing ... i
			should. have made you open it in the
			lorry
	
	she has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
	open. under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
	christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
	she throws the parcel and its contents hard into sam's
	chest. he topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
	the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
	
						jill
			there's your bomb! our annual bribes
			for official ass-holes like you!
	
	sam sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. liquor
	oozes from the broken bottle all over sam's suit. he is at
	a loss for words.
	
	jill's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
	badly hurt bomb victims. she goes to help them.
	
						jill
				(to sam)
			come on, make yourself useful, there
			are people hurt!
			
	jill goes around trying to make the injured comfortable.
	sam follows her. he takes off his jacket with his
	information retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
	make a pillow for one of these victims. by now sirens are
	wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
	general pandemonium. security guards run into the area and
	begin arresting everyone, including the dead and injured.
	one of the guards tries to drag off the woman whom jill is
	attending.
	
						jill
			hey stop ... she's hurt!
	
	the guard gives jill a thump in the side of the face with
	his gloved hand. sam sees red.
	
						sam
			don't touch her!!
	
	the guard looks up and as he does so he is transformed
	into the giant warrior from sam's dream. he towers over
	the wounded, the dying and the debris of the blasted
	lingerie department. sam grabs for a weapon and comes up
	with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. it
	makes a passable club.
	
						jill
			sam .... don't!!
	
	the two combatants square off ... looking for an opening
	... a chink in the other's defences - at which point sam
	is flattened from behind by a trooper's gun butt.

	sam is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. he
	tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing
	descent. with a thud he hits the bottom. stunned, bruised
	and battered he tries to get up. standing over him are the
	grey prisoners. they press forward.
	
						sam
				(feebly)
			where is she? is she here?
	
	the grey prisoners dissolve into what looks like several
	baggees.
