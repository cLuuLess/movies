28  int.   posh restaurant (entrance)	   day		   28
	
	the conversation between sam and his mother takes place
	while they are going through the sort of security checks
	familiar at airports. they are, however, just outside the
	velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
	
					   mother
				(in full flow)
			mr helpmann was very close to your
			poor father. he was very close to me.
			still is. he'll take you under his
			wing at information retrieval. you'll
			like it when you get there.
	
						sam
			you're not listening, mother.
	
	a warning buzzer goes off as mother's handbag goes thru
	security check. it turns out to have been activated by a
	gaily wrapped package. a security guard relieves her of it
	and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
	executive toy which we have seen twice before.
	
					   mother
			it's a present for my son.
	
	she takes the toy back and hands it to sam.
	
					   mother
			i hope you like it. it's very
			exclusive.
	
						sam
			what is it?
	
					   mother
			it's something for executives.
	
	at this point the maitre d arrives on the scene.
	
					  maitre d
			madam lowry, how exquisite to see you
			again. merry christmas.
	
	he pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. he
	looks disdainfully at sam's unfashionable clerk's suite
	
					   mother
			hello, spiro. merry christmas.
	
						spiro
				(blocking sam's way)
			i'm sorry but ...
	
					   mother
			you remember samuel, my son.
	
						spiro
				{suddenly unctious)
			oh, but of course ...
	
					   mother
			we're meeting mrs terrain.
	
						sam
			are we?
	
						spiro
			ah yes, the lady is waiting.
	
	spiro leads the way. sam and his mother follow, across the
	restaurant which is much like the palm court at the plaza
	new york. trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
	potted palms combine to impress us with their
	sophistication and taste. a string quartet can just be
	made out against the far wall. except for the unfortunate
	intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
	across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
	right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
	looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
	wealth and breeding. sam, mother and maitre d make their
	way across the room. the waltzing strains of the string
	quartet accompanying them.
	
	cut to group of tables with diners. at one of them sits a
	wealthy-looking older woman with a rather plain-looking
	daughter in her 20s. the older woman is easily
	distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
	that covers a goodish part of her head. the two of them
	(the mother and daughter, not the mother and bandage) are
	perusing the menus. sam notes the daughter, unpleased.
	
						sam
			mother, i thought we were going to be
			able to talk .... oh god, she's got
			what's he name with her.
	
	sam and his mother arrive at the table.
	
					 mrs terrain
			ida! sam!
	
					   mother
			alma, how are you? you're looking
			wonderful! hello, shirley.
	
					   shirley
				(shy to sam)
			salt?
	
					 mrs terrain
				(to shirley)
			not yet.
				(to sam and mother)
			happy christmas, sam.
	
	she hands sam a gaily wrapped package which obviously
	contains the same executive toy.
	
					   mother
			sorry we're late. shall we order? get
			it out of the way. what are you going
			to have alma?
	
	she starts to hunt through the huge menu the maitre d has
	just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
	dishes available.
	
					 mrs terrain
			i can't make up my mind whether to
			have a number one or a number two.
			what do you recommend, spiro?
						 
						spiro
				(conspiratorially)
			between you and me, madam, today the
			number two.
	
					 mrs terrain
			thank you, spiro. shirley, what are
			you going to have?
	
					   shirley
				(panics quietly)
	
						spiro
				(conspiratorially)
			between you and me, mademoiselle,
			today the number one. madam lowry?
	
					   mother
			oh, to hell with the diet, a number
			eight, please.
	
						spiro
			a most perceptive choice, madam, if i
			may say so.
				(to sam)
			monsieur?
	
						sam
				(brusquely)
			a steak, please. rare.
				(to his mother)
			mother, i need to ...
	
						spiro
				(piqued)
			monsieur. quel numero.
	
						sam
				(handing back menu)
			i don't know which numero.
	
						spiro
				(writing on pad)
			numero, trois.
	
	
	everyone is a bit embarrassed here. mother gives sam a
	withering look. spiro stalks away.
	
					   mother
				(trying to restart things)
			alma, you wicked thing ...
				(indicating bandages)
			you've started your treatment.
	
					 mrs terrain
			you noticed.
				(enthusiastically)
			i must tell you all about it.
	
						sam
				(to his mother)
			mother, will you listen to
	
	at this moment the food arrives. spiro elaborately lifts
	off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the
	plates of food. each order looks identical - a big splodge
	of brown lumpy stuff. the only differences between the
	lumps are the identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
	each. the beautiful colour photos match the photos which
	were on the menus.
	
						spiro
				(showing off that he
				remembers who's ordered
				what)
			numero huit, braised veal in wine
			sauce.
				(he sets it in front of
				sam's mother)
	
				mrs terrain
			it's too exciting. i've left dr jaffe
			and gone to dr. chapman.
	
						spiro
			numero deux, duck a l'orange.
				(he sets it in front of mrs
				terrain)
	
					   mother
			the acid man?
	
					 mrs terrain
			really, ida, just because his
			techniques are revolutionary ... i
			don't go around calling dr jaffe the
			knife man.
	
						spiro
			numero une, crevettes Ã  la
			mayonaaise.
				(he sets it in front of
				shirley)

					   mother
			i'm sorry alma, i didn't mean to
			sound so ...

					 mrs terrain
			that's all right ida ... it's just
			that he's such an artist. to him,
			cutting is so crude ... so primitive.

						spiro
			numero trois, steak.
				(he sets this in front of
				sam)
			monsieur, mesdames, bon appetit.

					 all but sam
			merci.

					 mrs terrain
			acid on the other hand, can be used
			for such wonderfully subtle shading,
			such delicate nuances - just like a
			rembrant etching ... and it's so much
			quicker. why, if it weren't for a
			teensy-weensy complication - the
			doctor said it could have happened to
			anyone - i would have had these
			bandages off yesterday.

					   shirley
				(to sam, after attracting
				her mother's attention and
				receiving a nod)
			salt?
	
	they are just about to dip into their respective splodges
	when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
	blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. chaos erupts
	around the carnage as waiters try putting out the flames
	with extinguishers. people, bloody and dying, are moaning.
	the diners not actually affected by the blast look up for
	a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
	their meals.
	
	immediately after the explosion.

					   mother
			what were we saying?
	
						sam
				(picking bomb debris out of
				his brown lump)
			this isn't rare!
	
					   mother
			by the way, i saw a wonderful idea
			for christmas presents at the
			chemists. gift tokens. medical gift
			tokens.
	
					 mrs terrain
			oh, that sounds marvellous.
	
					   mother
			yes, they're good at any doctor's and
			at many of the major hospitals - and
			they're accepted for gynecological
			complications including caesarian
			section.
	
	sam, in the act of taking in another forkful of his
	unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust
	
						sam
			look - please - i'm sorry - but
			honestly, mother, this is -
	
					   mother.
			i quite agree! - it's impossible!
	
	mother raises her arm to gain the attention of the maitre
	d who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency.
	the activity in the background has increased throughout
	the conversation. the fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
	blaring. ministry troops have charged in and are arresting
	waiters. stretchers have been bought in for the injured
	and these are being rushed past our little group's table.
	the maitre d comes to the table, his dj now blood-
	spattered.
	
					  maitre d
			i am sorry, madam ... i don't know
			what to say ... this very rarely
			happens to us - i'll do what i can
			straight away
	
	he hurries away.
	
					 mrs terrain
			really, sam - when are you going to
			do something about these terrorists?
	
						sam
			what? now? it's my lunch hour.

					   mother
			actually, alma, that's one of the
			little things i was dying to tell you
			... sam's been promoted to
			information retrieval.

						sam
				(angry and surprised)
			mother!

					 mrs terrain
			oh that's wonderful! congratulations
			sam...

					   shirley
			you can show those fucking murderous
			bastards a thing or two.

					 mrs terrain
				(shocked and embarrassed)
			shirley!
	
						sam
			stop this!
				(leaping to his feet)
			i'm not being promoted. i'm not going
			to information retrieval!
				(he scrumples promotion
				notification which he has
				been holding and throws it
				on the floor)
			if i want you to stick your oar in,
			mother, i'll tell you where to stick
			it!
	
	everybody is shocked. he recovers his composure slightly.
	embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper
	which he starts smoothing back into its flat state.
	
					   shirley
				(back to her uncertain
				form)
			pepper...?
	
						sam
			look - i've got to get back -
	
	as sam goes, maitre d reappears with a group of waiters -
	those remaining unarrested - whom he has organised to gut
	up a folding screen around the table. this cuts of the
	sight if not the noise of the victims of the explosion.
	
					   mother
			sam ... you haven't had dessert.
	
						sam
			i'm sorry. i don' t want dessert. i
			don't want promotion. i don't want
			anything.
	
					   mother
			don't be childish, samuel. of course
			you want something. you must have
			hopes, wishes, dreams.
	
	their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
	rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.
	
						sam
				(shouts loud)
			no, nothing. not even dreams!
