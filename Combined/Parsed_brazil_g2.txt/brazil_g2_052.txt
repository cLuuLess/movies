62  int.   sam's office				  day		   62
	
	sam looks lost ... disoriented. he doesn't know where to
	begin because there's nothing to begin with. he squeezes
	in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
	starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. there in his
	"in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
	gaily wrapped with a card from helpmann - merry xmas &
	welcome. sam can't quite believe. he returns to lining up
	his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
	against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. sam
	turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
	both fall over with a "plop". puzzled, he stands the books
	up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". same result.
	intrigued, a bit exasperated, sam carefully, and before
	his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
	and "plop", the books topple over. puzzled, sam grabs hold
	of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
	wall. the desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
	somehow held stubbornly. sam grits his teeth, reallllly
	pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.
	intrigued, sam gets up, goes around his desk and heads for
	the door.
