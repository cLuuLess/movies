	the lift comes to rest. sam is still trying to get it to
	respond and return him to the lobby. two technicians are
	waiting as the doors open. from sam's pov he sees them
	hang a sign on the door and walk away. he bangs the
	buttons for another moment with no result. he looks out of
	the lift and is able to read the sign - "lift out of
	order". frantically he looks around for another lift. all
	the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
	to one side, its doors standing open. rushing over to it
	he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
	there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. before
	he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.
	
						voice
			hey, you - get out of there.
	
	a guard approaches looking tough and mean.
	
						guard
			what do you think you're doing ...
			that's the deputy minister's lift.
	
						sam
			sorry, i'm in a hurry.
	
						guard
			hold on, sonny ... let's see your
			i.d.
	
	sam fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to
	the lobby before jill leaves. he has forgotten he is
	wearing his new i.d. badge. the guard can't see it because
	jill's dossier is covering it.
	
						sam
			shit ... it's here somewhere. my
			name's lowry, sam lowry - expediting
			... can't this wait?
	
						guard
			no, sir ...
				(getting out book of forms)
			i'm going to have to file a report on
			this. now ... what date is it
			today?...
	
	sam gives up trying to find his i.d. card.
	
						sam
				(frantic)
			sorry, it'll have to wait.
	
	he runs off - dropping suit - towards some stairs he has
	spotted.
	
						guard
			stop!! come back!
	
	he starts to run after sam. two other guards also give
	chase.
