21  int.   record clerk's pool						 21
	
	we come in on a close up of a pink version of the receipt
	being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we pull out to
	reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
	desks, each desk with a built-in t.v. console, and each
	(except one) occupied by a clerk. every desk is snowed
	under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
	the previous scene. more pacers are delivered to each desk
	intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. office boys
	bustle about with even more paperwork. from the back of
	the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
	tabulations, figures ... all of this activity is
	supervised from an elevated walkway by mr kurtzman.
	satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
	walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
	of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.

	mr kurtzman goes through this door and as he closes it
	behind him, all activity in the clerks pool ceases. each
	clerk adjusts his t.v. screen with the flick of a switch,
	and all the screens change to something which looks very
	like "the good, the bad and the ugly".
