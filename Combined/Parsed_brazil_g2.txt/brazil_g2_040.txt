49  int.   sam's corridor				evening		49
	
	the transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
	of sam's corridor. passengers disembark and head for
	various doors along the corridor. sam almost fails to get
	off in time - so concentrated on jill's picture is he.
	looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
	something he heads for his own front door.
