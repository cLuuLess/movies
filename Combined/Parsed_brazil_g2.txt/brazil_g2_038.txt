47  int.   record clerks pool			 day		   47
	
	it is the end of the work day. the clerks are busily
	getting their coats and leaving the office. as the last
	one goes mr. kurtzman comes out of his private office with
	his hat and coat on. he turns out the office light. he
	sees sam isolated in the empty room, still working at his
	computer console. totally absorbed in what he is doing.
	
					  kurtzman
			oh ... sam. i've had the transport
			pool onto me ... you don't know
			anything about a personnel
			transporter gone missing do you?
	
	sam doesn't seem to hear him. on the computer screen is a
	front and side view picture of jill. her name and code
	number is at the top of the screen. sam is punching up
	personal dossier information like "age", "height",
	"weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
	"distinguishing marks" etc.
	
						sam
				(preoccupied)
			a "personnel" transporter? they've
			got it wrong. i had a personal
			transporter. i'll do the paperwork
			tomorrow -
	
	sam punches up a few more categories for jill's dossier.
	
					  kurtzman
			is it all right about mrs buttle's
			cheque?
	
						sam
			i delivered it.
	
					  kurtzman
			can i forget it?
	
						sam
			yes.
	
	sam punches a few more buttons on the computer.
	
					  kurtzman
			what a relief!
				(on reflection)
			i shall probably have nightmares.
	
	at this point the word "classified" superimposes itself
	over most of the screen and "irq/3" starts agitating at
	the bottom
	
						sam
			damn! blast!
	
					  kurtzman
			what's the matter?
	
						sam
			you don't happen to know how i can
			get around an irq/3 do you?
	
					  kurtzman
			all information on 3rd level suspects
			is classified.
	
						sam
			i know that.
	
					  kurtzman
			all enquiries to information
			retrieval. which is hopeless, of
			course. they never tell you anything.
			but come the time they want something
			from us ...
	
	throughout this verbal wallpaper sam has been punching
	keys cancelling the classified overprint. he then punches
	in the code for a hard-copy print-out. jill's two-view
	computer portrait rolls out as sam ponders his options.
	
						sam
				(cutting off kurtzman)
			i've go to accept that promotion to
			get behind this, haven't i?
	
					  kurtzman
			yes.
				(realising what he's
				suggesting)
			no! you can't! you've only just
			turned it down!
				(thinking sam is joking)
	
						sam
			i never signed the form.
	
					  kurtzman
			i did it for you.
	
						sam
			what! shit!
			
					  kurtzman
			it's what you wanted isn't it?
	
						sam
			yes ... no ... i don't, know.
	
	kurtzman picks up jill's print-out and glances at it. he
	grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.
	
					  kurtzman
			come on, before they turn the lights
			out.
	
	sam nods. he turns off the machine. he stands up and
	follows kurtzman towards the door. the door is some
	distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
	out. kurtzman bumps into a desk and curses.
