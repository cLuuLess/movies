40  int.   buttle sitting room			day		   40
	
	cut to sam entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
	in half-darkness. this is the same flat from which the
	father was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
	still in the ceiling. sam becomes aware of a woman sitting
	absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
	broken) window in the room.
	
						sam
			are you mrs buttle?
	
	the woman nods very slightly without looking at him.
	
						sam
			my name is lowry - sam lowry. i'm
			from the ministry of information.
				(no response)
			i've come to give you a cheque.
	
	sam takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
	table to tempt mrs buttle into a flicker of interest but
	she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. sam
	pushes the cheque a little way towards mrs buttle but she
	does not respond.
	
						sam
				(indicting cheque)
			it's a refund ... i'm afraid there
			was a mistake.
	
					 mrs buttle
			mistake?
	
						sam
				(encouraged)
			yes. not my department ... i'm only
			records. it seems that mr buttle was
			overcharged by information retrieval.
			i don't think they usually make
			mistakes ... but, er ... i suppose
			we're all human.
	
	sam looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
	
			oh ... what happened to the ...?
	
	he gets nothing back.
	
			actually, my bringing this here is
			rather unorthodox ... usually any
			payments are made through the central
			computer ... but, er ... there were
			certain difficulties, and rather than
			cause delay, we thought you might
			appreciate this now ... it being
			christmas.
	
					 mrs buttle
			my husband's dead, isn't he?
	
						sam
			er ... i assure you mrs buttle, the
			ministry is always very scrupulous
			about following up and eradicating
			error. if you have any complaints
			which you'd like to make, i'd be more
			than happy to send you the
			appropriate forms.
	
					 mrs buttle
			what have you done with his body?
	
						sam
			um ...
	
	mrs buttle starts to cry.
	
						sam
			look, i'm very sorry, but i'm afraid
			i don't know anything about it ...
			i'm really just delivering the
			cheque. er ... if you wouldn't mind
			signing these receipts
				(producing blue and pink
				receipts)
			i'll go and leave you in peace.
	
	sam picks up the cheque and gives it to mrs buttle
	together with the receipts. mrs buttle tears them up and
	throws them in his face.
	
						sam
			uh ...
	
					 mrs buttle
			he hadn't done anything ... he was
			good ... what have you done with his
			body?
	
	sam looks around for an escape and sees a young buttle
	standing in the doorway. the boy is looking at him with a
	blank tearful face. suddenly the boy launches himself at
	sam with terrible ferocity. sam is knocked against the
	wall. a mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
	floor. the boy is all over sam kicking and pulling his
	hair. mrs buttle's reaction, however, is to try and pull
	the boy away from sam. by the time she succeeds, sam is on
	his hands and knees, in pain. the boy is crying and
	shouting, and mrs buttle is loudly trying to quieten the
	boy.
	
	from sam's pov, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
	floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with jill's
	head and shoulders framed in the hole. the moment is
	unreal for sam in his dazed condition. the vision seems
	unreal too. jill is staring at sam out of the piece of
	mirror and. she's very much the girl from his dream now.
	
						jill
			are you alright?
	
						sam
				(mumbles)
			it's you ... it's you ...
	
						jill
			mrs buttle, are you alright?
	
	sam grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
	angle so that the vision disappears. he looks for the
	vision on the floor but can't find it. then he begins to
	realise the reality of what he has seen. he stands up,
	dazed and battered. mrs buttle has been looking up at the
	ceiling. sam looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
	the empty space of the hole.
	
						sam
			wait! stop! come back!!
	
	mrs buttle is shouting. sam rushes out of the flat.
