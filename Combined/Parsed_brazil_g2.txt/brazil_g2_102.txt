	it is the end of the working day. jack is leaving for
	home. he is putting on his executive-styled bullet-proof
	vest and packing his "secret connection" briefcase. as the
	scene progresses sam and jack proceed out of the door and
	down he corridor, passing other i.r. officials. sam is
	dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to
	jack to is trying to distance himself from him.
	
						sam
			come off it, jack! of course you can
			check to see if she's been arrested.
	
						jack
			i'm sorry, sam, i'm afraid this whole
			case has become much more complicated
			since last we talked.
	
						sam
				(exasperated)
			she's innocent, jack --- she's done
			nothing wrong.
	
						jack
			tell that to the wives of the
			security men she blew up this
			afternoon. listen, we've also had a
			report just in from central services
			that tuttle has wrecked an entire
			flat and sabotaged adjacent central
			services systems - as a matter of
			fact, in your block. i'd keep my eyes
			open if i were you, sam. bye.
	
						sam
				(catching up with jack)
			you don't really think tuttle and the
			girl are in league?
	
						jack
			i do. goodbye.
