	the impression is that the place could be an abandoned
	airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
	contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all
	the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles
	of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
	grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
	houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
	areas of roofing. each group of assorted supplies lies
	inside the squares of the grid of streets. the streets are
	eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each
	square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. the effect
	is a nightmarish gigantic aladdin's cave of black shadows
	and garishly lit mountains of stuff.
