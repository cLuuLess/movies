int. robert's coffee shop - neil + chris - day

in a booth next to the window. out the window is morning
traffic on beverly boulevard. empty coffee cups say they've
been there a while. they lean close and talk low. neil's
explosive behind it.

                         neil
             lapd? the g? what? where the
             hell did this heat come from?

                         chris
             maybe it's only the ema score,
             not us.

                         neil
                 (low)
             wake up!
                 (beat)
             assume they got our phones, our
             houses bugged, i beepers on all
             the cars. we got major problems..
             where's cerrito?

neil looks over at the cook behind the high counter and
recognizes him.
