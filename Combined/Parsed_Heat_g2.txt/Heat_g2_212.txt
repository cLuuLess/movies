charlene crosses back to her chair. farina stares at her
unsure. marciano re-enters and paces idly.

                      marciano
              (worried)
          where the hell is he?

                      charlene
              (taunts him)
          maybe he's not coming.

                      marciano
              (explodes)
          you better hope he shows! or
          you're going to the can, you two
          dollar...

farina grabs marciano, spins and slams him into the wall.

                      farina
              (shouts at cop)
          get him the hell out of here!

          this guy's  john pearson. valid
          i.d. car's  registered to one
          bukowski.   ran a make to dmv.
          it's clean.   so's the car.

                      farina
              (into radio)
          let him go.

farina clicks off the radio and picks up the phone.

                      farina
              (continuing; to
               charlene)
          want a cup of coffee while we
          wait, mrs. shiherlis?

                      charlene
              (sad smile)
          that would be nice.

farina dials. charlene closes her eyes. it's like she
sees the gray institution of a women's prison. she shuts
her eyes tighter to make the vision go away. tears start
flowing.
