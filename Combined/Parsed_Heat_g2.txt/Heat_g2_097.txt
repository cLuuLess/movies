it's later. breedan's been sick. now he's sober. they
sit near trash barrels under a huge plaster half shell,
fishing nets and blue lights.

                      breedan
          i got any left?

                      lillian
          there's other paychecks. you
          blow it off. it's worth it,
          baby, cause you mess with that
          man and you be violated right
          back to san quentin. so you got
          to handle it 'til we get you a
          different job.

                        breedan

          invented the hard time this
          gangster can't handle!.
               (crashes)
          why you stickin' with me, lillian?
          why?

lillian stares right at him.

                      lillian
          'cause i'm proud of you.   proud
          you my man.

                       breedan
              (cracks up)
          proud of me?
