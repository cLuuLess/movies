int. second floor apartment - charlene - fight

enters and sees marciano already there.    surprised:

                      charlene
              (screams)
          whose side are you on?

                      marciano
          i'm on yours.

                      charlene
          you slimy piece of shit.     what a
          joke.

                      marciano
          you told me you want out from
          under? you're scared to death
          of neil. you wanted out? this
          is out!

                      charlene
          what's your end?

                      marciano

          into this?

                         farina

                           marciano
                   (surprised)
            huh?

                        farina
            you heard me. she had a rough
            ride.
                (beat)
            go mix her a drink. cabinet
            above the sink.

                           marciano
            fuck her.

                        farina
            get the fuck in there!

marciano does. charlene seems to soften and relax and
take satisfaction at marciano's put-down.

                        farina
                (continuing; soft)
            he's right. and you know it.
            you think you'd be betraying
            chris?

                           charlene
                   (right to his face)
            yes.

                        farina
            well, you're right. you would
            be. but if you don't betray
            chris, you betray dominick.
            because he becomes an orphan
            when you go to prison as an
            accessory 'cause you got no living
            parents to take him. then he
            ends up state-raised and fucked
            for life. your son dominick's
            innocent. he didn't choose a
            life like that. chris did.

charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the
door - presumably at dominick.

                        farina
                (continuing)
            give up chris. you get off clean.
            do it for your kid.

charlene sits - shell-shocked - dressed in black with white
face and red lipstick. marciano re-enters with a drink
for her.  charlene looks towards the bedroom containing
dominick, then nods her head "yes." farina dials a number.

                       farina
               (continuing; into
                cellular phone)
           vincent. it's me. we're set
           here. she'll make the call.

charlene dials a number into the regular phone.   then:

                       charlene
               (into phone)
           i'm going to give you an address
           of where i'm staying. could you
           get it to chris?

                                                   cut to:
