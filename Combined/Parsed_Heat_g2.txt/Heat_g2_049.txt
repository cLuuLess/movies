int. albert torena's apartment - albert torena - day

answers the door. daylight floods in past the silhouette
of hanna who shoves torena in the chest, knocking him into
the apartment. hanna, following him in...

                      hanna
          you were supposed to get back to
          me last night. so where the
          fuck were you, albert?

                      albert
          i couldn't break free, man!

                      hanna
          i oughta violate your ass right
          now.

                      albert
          i was all night hitting up los
          vatos like one of those flamenco
          matador guys. cuttin' in real
          smooth. generating leads and
          shit. i'm a dancer, man!

albert torena's an anorexic latino fence. hanna scans the
apartment. religious objects crowd the mantle. fourteen
stolen tv's in packing cases in the dining room.

                      hanna
          you're a bust-out speed freak
          jackin' metamphetamine again.
              (beat)
          i'm in a hurry.

                      albert

                       hanna
          no.   right now.

                      albert
          i implore him, man. but he say
          "no."
              (beat)
          he in phoenix. tonight's the
          best i can do for you. the zebra
          on crenshaw. eleven o'clock.

                      hanna
          you be there, too.

                        albert
          mon, i go

                        hanna
          be there!

hanna leaves.

                      cezar
          i picked you out to pitch it to
          first, but don't think you're
          the only action in town and i'm
          giving it away. 'cause i'm not.

kelso's a large crippled man in a wheelchair.

                        neil
          what is it?

                      cezar
          a bank. on thursdays it gets
          cash deposits for distribution
          to other branches. the branches
          have to buttress their cash
          accounts to handle friday payroll
          checks from a toyota and nissan
          plant, a steel mill and two
          refineries. one day a week,
          thursday, the main branch carries
          the full whack.

                      neil
          you want a $100,000 advance,
          against a full 101. why?

               cezar
   'cause i can get it. 'cause
   this is the best thing i seen in
   three years. 'cause a screw-up
   makes 10 percent of nothin' equal
   nothin'. and 'cause those are
   the terms and they ain't
   negotiable.

               neil
   on the prowl or strong?

               cezar
   strong. through the front door.
   during the day.

               neil
   how many guys?

                cezar
   four.   three plus a driver.

               neil
   that's not a $100,000 worth
   anything. you're giving me an
   address to what's strictly a
   cowboy score: "get the guns and
   let's go!" we smash, grab and
   boogie while they hit the alarm.

               cezar
   three alarms. and that's why
   the price. 'cause you chop-in
   through the roof the night before
   on the prowl and bypass 'em. i
   got circuit diagrams, blue prints,
   the works. so yeah, they hit
   the alarms, but nothing gonna
   happen.

               neil
   do i have to kill people?

               cezar
   i doubt it. two men have the
   two keys to open the box.

               neil
   full architectural, plumbing and
   electric, camera placements?

                cezar
   all of it.

               neil
   what do you estimate?

                      cezar
          eight point, one. eight point,
          two million dollars.

that gives neil pause. kelso gets satisfaction from neil's
reaction to the amount. then:

                      cezar
              (continuing)
          where's nate?

                       neil
          he hadda make a call.
              (beat)
          you're on.
              (rising)
          here's five grand earnest money.
          you get the rest after lunch.

they shake hands.
