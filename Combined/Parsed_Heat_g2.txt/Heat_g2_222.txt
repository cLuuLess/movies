int. emergency corridor - tracking hanna with lauren as
justine - day

catches up.

                      hanna
              (to lauren)
          you're gonna be okay, baby.
          your mommy and me are here.
          everybody's here. we're going
          to take care of you. we love
          you...

lauren relaxes in his arms, carried like a baby; and tears
stream down her face.

justine

one arm locked around hanna - trying to see her daughter.
then lauren goes wild again and hanna tightens.

                      orderly
          let me take her.

                       hanna
          i got her.

                      doctor
          watch her tongue!

                      hanna
          she's not epileptic!   this isn't
          a seizure.

                      doctor
              (to nurse)
          5 mg of thorazine.

hospital waiting room - hanna + justine - later

his arm around her.    she leans back against him.

                      hanna
          you okay, baby?

she shrugs. then she moves closer to him and be pulls her
into his shoulder.

int - mercedes - neil + eady - night

neil drives.   he's pensive.   he sees the "hyatt" sign.

                      radio announcer (v.o.)
              (radio filter)
          hey there, old aware ones, and
          you, too, my fair ones ...

neil kills the radio.

                        eady
          what is it?

                        neil
              (lies)
          nothing.

he turns the radio back on.

                      radio announcer (v.o.)
              (radio filter)
          brought to you this fine day
          which is a-okay!

the mercedes is in the left. suddenly neil pulls across
three lanes and shoots up an offramp - fast. neil checks
his watch.

                      neil
          i got this errand to run that i
          forgot.

                      eady
          the airport is right there.    is
          there time?

                      neil
              (continuing)
          sure. it's a thing i got to
          take care of... is all.
