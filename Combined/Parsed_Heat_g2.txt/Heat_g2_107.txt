to the cylinder, exposing electrical wiring and magnetic
tumblers and "gates."

ecu: chris' fingers

like a cardiac surgeon's, have  a balletic grace as they
manipulate the tumblers so the  groove cut in each one lines
up. as they do, a bar of metal   called the "fence" falls
into the channel created by the  lined-up gates, unlocking
the mechanism.

wide: chris

touches the door. it swings - soundlessly - open on its
hinges.  surprisingly, they now pack up. neil, chris and
cerrito climb into the pontiac and drive away. the door
was left wide open.
