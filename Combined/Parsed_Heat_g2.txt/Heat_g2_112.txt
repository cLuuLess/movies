int. basement - neil

looks up at the ceiling. down at the floor. he thinks.
pause. this is the first tire we've heard them speak in
this sequence.

                       neil
               (he decides; whispers)
           ...we walk.

                       chris
               (tense whisper; re:
                the box)
           i'm 60 seconds away. it's a rat
           or something.

                       neil
               (whispers)
           it is not an animal sound.   we
           are out of here.

                       chris
               (tense whisper)
           we need the cash!!

                      neil
              (tense whisper;
               already going)
          we walk!! now.

no argument.   chris puts down his equipment.

they strip off and drop their surgical gloves. chris  tosses
his shop coat on the floor. both unpin the lapels of  what
is revealed to be dark suits with shirts underneath.  they
abandon everything. they walk out the back door and  keep
going.
