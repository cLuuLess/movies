ext. general liquors, las vegas - wide - day

a "las vegas police department" car pulls to the curb.
hanna and schwartz get out and cross the crabgrass, dirt,
and debris-filled forecourt to a cheaply constructed wood
and glass one-story building.

                                                   cut to:

marcian0's office - marciano - day

hangs up the phone.    we hear the door open.

                       marciano
               (rising; big smile)
           what can i do for you guys?
           ignores his hand and shoves him
           back into his office chair with
           an open hand.

closer

hanna rips open marciano's desk drawer finds a gun, unloads
it, throws it on the floor, finds a small tape recorder,
pops the tape out and tosses it to schwartz. then he
flashes a badge at marciano.

                        marciano
            l.a.p.d. who the hell you think
            you're pushing around? you got
            no jurisdiction and i know people
            here!

                       schwartz
            who? the fucking tooth fairy!
            so what?

                        hanna

            jersey warrant for smuggling
            cigarettes up from north carolina
            three years ago or you go to
            work for us. cut and dried.
            that...is...it.

                        marciano

                        schwartz
            "who?" the stranger you been
            talkin' dirty to on the telephone
            every day for the last month.

                        marciano

                         hanna
                 (sits down)
             'cause she's got a great ass and
             you got your head all the way up
             it.

                           marciano
                   (defeated)
             so?

                         hanna
             so it's no big thing. i don't
             even want her. you can have
             her, after. i want her husband
             and all his buddies; that's all.
             and you're gonna help.
