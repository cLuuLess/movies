ext. safeway - hanna + civilians

who panic. shooting. windows explode. a lady holds her
ears and shrieks. a newspaper coin box shatters. a man's
bag of groceries explode milk and eggs everywhere. he
goes down.

hanna

doesn't have a clear shot and drops, dragging people down
with him.

neil

behind the wheel - burns rubber pulling out of the lot
over curbstones and through a fence into the alley.
