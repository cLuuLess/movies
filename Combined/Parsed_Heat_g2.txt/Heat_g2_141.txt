ext. first commercial bank of wilmington - traveling past
entrance - day

we pan to hold it. the entrance is on the street.    the
parking lot is on the side.

                      neil (o.s.)
          there's the slot.

pull back to reveal we're shooting from inside a mercury
station wagon. breedan drives. by now   we're wide all the
way from behind the rear seat. cerrito  and chris sit in
the rear. ahead, cones block parking in  one slot.

                      breedan
          looks right. come out the door,
          your angle takes you into the
          car. don't have to run around
          the doors. you want them open?

                      neil
          no. 'cause time is not a problem.
          and i want nothing to look weird.

                      breedan
          po-lice response time?

                      neil
          there is none.

                      breedan
          why?

                      chris
          cause we bypassed all the alarms
          last night.
              (continuing)
          for you this whole gig is a slow
          cruise down hawthorne...
