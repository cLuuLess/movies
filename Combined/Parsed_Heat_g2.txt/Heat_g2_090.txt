int. chinese restaurant - plum wine at table - later

elaine drinks. widen. michael whispers in her ear. she
smiles. then she laughs and drapes an arm around his neck
and plants a kiss that almost knocks him over. the party,
winding down. everyone luxuriates in the afterglow.

charlene and chris

sedate, comfortable, each in separate thoughts.

                       chris
               (quietly)
           you okay?

                          charlene
           i'm fine.

                       chris
               (arm around her)
           makin' it happen this time...

                         charlene
           i hope so.    i really hope so.

they're close for this moment: the afterglow of the dinner.

neil

looks at charlene.

charlene

sees and holds his look and then her attention shifts to
elaine.

neil

checks his watch.     waiter approaches neil with the bill.

                          michael
                  (to neil)
