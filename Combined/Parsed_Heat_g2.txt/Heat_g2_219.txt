int. holiday inn: hanna's room wide - night

it's empty. out the windows the mustard hollywood glare
stays low into the building.

angle - a shadowy figure

surreptitiously moves through the room examining things.
it's a woman and in rear shot she is naked. we hear a key
in the lock. she turns: it is lauren.

door

opens. hanna - disgusted - tips off his clothes and throws
them at the furniture. he turns on the shower and goes
in. he didn't see lauren.
