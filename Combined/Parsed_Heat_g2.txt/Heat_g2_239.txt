          what's the situation?

          three teams are moving up the
          other three stairwells to the
          14th floor. elevators are out
          of commission because of the
          fire alarm. surveillance said
          mccauley looked right at 'em.

          yeah, yeah, that's fine.   stay
          on it. 10-4.

for some reason hanna's disinterested. he's moving down a
different track. he's cruising the streets looking for
something else.

hanna's pov: side streets

adjoining the hotel are cluttered with emergency vehicles,
cars, pedestrians, on-lookers, service people from adjoining
buildings.

hanna

trying to see through, past, around everything.    we don't
know what it is he's looking

hanna's pov: fire engine, ambulance, mercedes, black and
white...

woman waiting in the passenger seat. it is eady. she's a

it's what he was looking for.
