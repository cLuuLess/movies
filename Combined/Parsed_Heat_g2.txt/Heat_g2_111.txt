int. ema, inc. - bruce

is in agony. his muscles are cramped - he rolls on the
floor trying to control himself. his head inches up, drops
back.

hanna

calms bruce with hand gestures.

wide

the clock says 2:00 a.m.

                       hanna
               (tense whisper)
           quiet! !

bruce starts shaking, violently. he twists. his belt
buckle hits the floor. there is the smallest tap. hanna
closes his eyes.
