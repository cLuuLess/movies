int. south la brea motel - close on hooker - night

she's a black prostitute - all of 18. she looks bored and
chews gum as she puts on a rayon japanese kimono and exits.

angle on bed - waingro

sits on the edge of the rumpled bed in his jeans. he wears
a neck brace. his face is still swollen and bruised from
neil's beating. his belt isn't buckled. he's in a daze.
o.s. we hear a toilet flush. prostitute returns. waingro
looks over at her:

                         prostitute
              (tired)
          hey, baby.

                      waingro
          showed you a good time?     huh?

                       prostitute
          oh, yeah.   you fly. you cool.

             don't lie to me. i can always
             tell when people lie to me.

                         prostitute

             horse and this was the monster
             fuck of my young life.
                 (pause)

                         waingro
             you don't have a truth-telling
             style.

                         prostitute
             the fuck's wrong with you?

waingro winds up and cracks the girl.     she knocks over a
cheap lamp and bounces off a wall.

prostitute

throws a small table at her. it smashes apart.
