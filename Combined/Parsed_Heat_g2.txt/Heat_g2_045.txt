the dried-out remains of dinner. hanna roots around, grabs
a lamb chop, forgets the rest and goes into the living
room. int. hanna living room - justine sees hanna, goes
back to book.

                       hanna

                         justine
             she's been in her room all day
             and won't talk. so "no," she's
             not okay. and neither am i.
                 (even tempered)
             if i try to create something
             like a mood between us you back
             away. i made a great dinner for
             us. that was four hours ago.

             alley off adams.
                 (beat)
             i'm really sorry the lamb got
             overcooked.

justine looks at him, elegantly rises, exits into the
bedroom and closes the door.

                         hanna
             looking after her is tired.
             very tired. he doesn't know why
             he said what he did. he regrets
             it. so he turns on his tv to
             watch the news and his eyes glaze
             over.
