flips six eggs on the grill, throws frozen french fries in
the oil, turns bacon, flips pancakes and dumps eight pieces
of bread in the toaster. solenko enters.

                        breedan
                (without turning)
            you spell me? i didn't take my
            break yet ...

                        solenko
            that spic, cisco kid, whatever,
            didn't show. after the lunch
            rush, haul out the garbage and
            mop the back. take your break
            later.

breedan takes it out on the toaster handles - banging down
each one.
