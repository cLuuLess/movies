nothing. then the pontiac with its lights off rolls
forward. chris gets out with a salesman's sample case and
pads down the five steps to the rear entry of the jewelry
store. chris is in a black suit and sneakers. there are
surgical gloves on his hands. the others stay in the car.

tighter: chris

assembles a heavy lock punch from the black case.      it's
formidable. he nods.

cerrito

in lineman's gear  is out of the car and he quickly climbs
the telephone pole  like an experienced lineman. the
telephone pole is  next to the roof upon which jackson and
the swat team are  staked-out.

top of pole - cerrito

arrives. he's 18 inches away from 11 cops.       team nor
cerrito are aware of each other.
