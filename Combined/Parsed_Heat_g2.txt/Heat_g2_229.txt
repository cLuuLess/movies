slide open. neil emerges. he does two things. he wedges
the ash tray to hold open the elevator door. then, he
smashes the glass and sets off the fire alarm. immediately
a siren sounds. the building's elevators - except neil's
descend. we hear:

           a fire has been reported. please
           leave your rooms now. proceed
           down marked fire exits. use the
           staircases. do not use the
           elevators. this is not a drill.
