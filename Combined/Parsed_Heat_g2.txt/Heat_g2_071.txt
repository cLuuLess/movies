          of orange county. horrell, piper
          and voight. they're working in
          the back of a trim shop on irvine.
          somebody was to pay him a visit
          this weekend, they'd find a
          metallic blue turbo...

raoul torena, albert's brother, is a thirty-five-year-old
with crew-cut black hair and a varri uomo sport jacket.
widen to include hanna.

                      hanna
          ...lookin' for me to rid you of
          your competition?

hanna's gaze drifts up into raoul's eyes: it's deadly.

                      albert
              (alarmed)
          raoul, hanna do what he say!
          that's why i reached for you..

hanna jerks raoul by the front of his verri uomo which is
being destroyed in hanna's fists.

                      hanna
          i'm not your 'carnal, you little
          motherfucker.
              (beat)
          and you 'know' 'cause i say so...
          after i hear what you got to
          tell me!

                       raoul
          okay!   okay...

hanna throws him back against the bench.

                      raoul
              (continuing)
          this is valuable shit! i could
          get killed telling you this shit!

low, flat and deadly:

                      hanna
          you can get killed ... walking
          down the street...

                      raoul
              (whisper)
          a dude i knew in mcneil's been
          out a couple, three years.

                        hanna
          yeah?

                      raoul
          he's an action junkie. if he'd
          said nothin', i'd a thought
          nothin'. but he goes on and on
          into extra overtime on how he
          ain't been do-in' nothin' and
          then i know this cat's got
          something goin' down...

raoul leans back in the booth, nods his head, proud of
this pearl of information. hanna looks at albert like
he's crazy.

                      hanna
              (to albert)
          what's wrong with you? you drag
          me here to waste my time like
          this?
              (to raoul)
          you saw a guy on the street...
          who's an ex-con?

                      raoul
          yeah.

                      hanna
          ...what do you expect for that?
          a junior g-man badge?

                      raoul
          you gonna make the call on the
          porsches?

                      hanna
          are you kidding?

hanna gets up to leave.

                      raoul
          i'm telling you this slick is
          double-duty! a real doubleblank
          mo-fo.

                      hanna
          what?

                      raoul
          huh ... ?

                      hanna
          you said "slick."

                      raoul
          yeah, that's what he calls people.
          "slick."

hanna plays it low key.   hanna sits back down.

                      hanna
          tell me about him...

          tattoos. peacock right here.

                       raoul (cont'd)
          ear. he's in c-block two days,
          and in the shower some muslim
          comes up into his face and he
          cuts the guy a new opening for a
          colostomy bag and goes back to
          shampooing his hair...
              (laughs)
