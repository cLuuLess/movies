ext. street - armored car

door crashes down, opens, guard one falls out. then guard
two. the driver comes out his door. cerrito grabs him.
neil handles the two guards.

                         neil
             up against the wall!

he yanks their guns away - his 9mm.      at the back of each
man's head in turn.

the driver

tries to twist away as a reflex. cerrito cracks him in
the face with the ar15, driving him to the wall.

wide: cerrito + waingro

cover the three. neil moves into the armored truck to
join chris who's already inside, ripping it apart,
searching. we see him disregard cash.

                      neil
              (to chris)
          8o seconds left.    move it.

waingro

behind the beautiful lady mask: trying hard to do good.
his gun jumps from guard to guard to guard.

neil

looks at waingro.   widen.   waingro's aware of neil's
scrutiny.

                      waingro
              (to guard two)
          flatten - up against it!    higher!

he slaps the back of guard two's head with the gun barrel.

                      guard two
              (a big, boastful
               man, quietly)
          ...you didn't have that gun..

                        waingro
          what?!

                       cerrito
              (cuts in; cool)
          that's true, slick, cause you're
          a real tough guy. but he has
          the gun. and me, too. so shut
          the fuck up.

wide

neil and chris emerge from the van with one manila envelope.

                      neil
          move out!
              (checks watch)
          38 seconds left!

wide: waingro

it's like waingro can't hear. he's fixated with guard
two. guard two turns and looks at him arrogantly - more
concerned with his masculine pride than his safety. he's
a stupid man.

waingro's pov: very wide

things happen slowly.

                        waingro (o.s.)
                (quietly)
            ...hadda mouth off? in front of
            them?

waingro's arm points out at the man - with the gun at the
end - and fires.

angle

guard two is blown up against the wall.    driver moves...

neil

leaving, spins.

driver

reaching for a two-inch hammerless .38 back-up tucked in
his boot. as he brings it up...

neil's 9mm. browning

fires two hammered-on shots.

cerrito's ar15

covers guard one. guard one stares at the men in the masks.
once killing begins, he knows what will happen. cerrito
looks at neil...

neil

angry; nods.

cerrito

kills guard one with three shots.

on ambulance

neil literally throws waingro into the back.
