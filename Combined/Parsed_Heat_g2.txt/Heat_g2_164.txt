int. dr. bob's dog and cat hospital surgery - chris - day

is unconscious on the table. bob, a veterinarian of 55 in
a white coat and bald head, works on him. dogs bark o.s.
from the kennels.

a clamp clatters into the bowl. chris moans in a dry rasp
and convulses. bob motions to neil to hold chris'
shoulders.

neil

holds chris down.

                           bob (o.s.)
            bottom tray.

with one hand neil gives bob a tray of syringes.

wide - the surgery

bob's back obscures a series of injections into chris'
neck and shoulder.

it's a veterinarian surgery and the metal table chris is
an is for holding down dogs. long leather straps aren't
buckled. there's pictures of cocker spaniels on the walls.
spent syringes clatter into pans.
