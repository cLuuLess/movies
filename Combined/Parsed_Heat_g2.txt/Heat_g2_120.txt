          my car. bugs. two of 'em.
          count 'em. one in the wheel
          well. second behind the fire
          wall. night of the party? i
          dropped elaine and swung by ema
          to check out the junction box...

             without the platinum how do we
             buy the bank score?

                         neil
             i cash in t-bills to pay-off
             kelso. that's not our problem.

                         cerrito
             what the hell happened to van
             zant and our 750?

                         neil
             with the heat we got, you wanna
             play world war two in the streets
             with van zant?

                         cerrito
             van zant gets a pass?!

                         neil
             fuck van zant. i got more
             motivation to whack him than you
             do. he is a luxury. our problem
             is: jam and take the bank or
             split.
                 (beat)
             and i mean right fucking now.
             do not go home, pack, nothing.
             thirty seconds from now we are
             on the road. gone.

no answer.    chris and cerrito are thinking.

                         chris
             for me, the bank's worth the
             stretch. i say accept the risk,
             stay.

             michael?

                         cerrito
                 (quietly)
             i roll with you. whatever...

                         neil
                 (quietly)
             not on this one, michael. on
             this one you make up your own
             mind.

                         cerrito
                 (he can't)
             ...you figure this the best thing
             to do?

                        neil
           i got some plans. to go away
           after. so for me, it's worth
           the stretch.

chris is surprised.

                       neil
               (continuing)
           but, elaine takes good care of
           you. you got plenty put away.
           t. bonds; real estate. if i
           were you, i'd be smart and cut
           loose of this.

cerrito

thinks.   the he shrugs, laughs:

                       cerrito
           hey. to me the action's half
           the juice anyway. i'm in.

                        neil
           all right.   all right.
