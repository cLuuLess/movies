ext. san diego freeway, phone booth - neil - twilight

green vapor lights have ignited on the freeway behind them.
neil drops the quarter and dials. eady sits in the mercedes -
waiting. behind them streams of cars and headlights pass
by. we hear a phone ring.

          still can't find nobody. it's
          in the delaware trust. you tell
          me later what to do. and about
          your ride. no changes. right
          on schedule.

           by the by: i heard your pal is
           checked into the airport hyatt
           under "jamieson"...if you still
           care...

neil doesn't answer.

                         nate (v.o.)
               (continuing; phone
                 filter)
           i figured you wouldn't waste the
           time.

in the background eady turns on the radio and watches neil
in the phone booth and rests her chin on her hand on the
door.

                        neil
               (into phone)
           you figured right.
               (smiles)
           take it easy, old man.

                        nate
                (phone filter; laughs)
           you take it easy. be careful,
           huh?

neil hangs up and turns to eady.    he stands there.    he
nods.

                       neil
               (to eady)
           that was the last bridge.

eady looks away.

neil

gets in and hugs her desperately. it's the most emotional
we've ever seen him. eady responds not at all. neil lets
her loose.
