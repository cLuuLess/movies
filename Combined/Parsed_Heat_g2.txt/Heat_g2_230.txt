                       painter one
               (still looking)
          yeah. whyn't you call out for
          pizza? sausage, peppers,
          onions...

                         painter two
              (ready)
          what?

                      painter one
          that chick on the ninth floor
          got naked and she's pressing
          herself against the glass again.

                      painter two
              (crosses to window)
          let me see.

painter one looks through the scope. he looks down at the
ninth floor and laughs. then he looks away and sees
something else:

painter two's pov: room

waingro goes to a drawer, pulls out a gun and starts towards
the door.

                         painter two (o.s.)
              (shouts)
          oh, boy...!
