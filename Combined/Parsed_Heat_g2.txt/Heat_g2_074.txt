ext. sunset. boulevard motel and alley - night

neon under the vapor lamps. o.s. the cacophony of horns
and sirens. pimps and hookers crowd the background. a
crime scene area near the garbage cans is roped off. an
ambulance, black-and-whites, a medical examiner's van clog
the alley.

crane down as hanna's car pulls in and he approaches the
medical examiner, richie, 25-35, black, diamond earring,
gray lab coat.

                       richie
               (to hanna)
           here's how we found her.

polaroid - black prostitute

in a nightgown, folded over the lip of a garbage can at
the waist. she's a pitiful rag doll. someone killed her
and then threw her away.

hanna

is too controlled.    anger's underneath.

                         hanna
           how old?

                       richie
           sixteen, seventeen.

                       hanna
           how'd she die, richie?

                       richie
           blunt instrument. cerebral
           hematoma.

                       hanna
           who are they?

their pov: heavyset black woman

and two stunned young boys. she's crying and arguing with
two uniformed lapd trying to hold her back. one lapd is a
black woman. the heavyset woman doesn't really know what
happened yet except it's bad.

                         richie (o.s.)
               (low)
           the family.

                       hanna (o.s.)
           what the hell are they doin'
           here?

richie + hanna

                       richie
               (low; shrugs)
           it's fucked up. somebody inside
           knew the girl and called the
           family.

now richie bends over the body bag on the ground and unzips
it. we don't see the dead girl. we only see hanna. a
third uniformed officer in the background spins away.

                      hanna
          oh, this is nice.

                      richie
          i wanted you to see this 'cause
          i got a feeling it's serial and
          gonna end up in your court.

                      hanna
          homicide getting anywhere?

                      richie
          nowhere.

hanna rises. the mother's arguing with the man cop because
she wants to see. horror and hysteria blossoming through
shock. she pushes the uniformed cop of the way. hanna
goes to try to help. they grapple.

                      mother
              (reaches out)
          baby! where's my baby.!

anguish. it's a mess. the woman collapsing into hanna's
arms. for one moment hanna's eyes lock onto hers. he
freezes. one doesn't forget the look he sees in her eyes.

                                                   cut to:
