int. "toys 'r' us store" - on cerrito - day

michael cerrito - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
he's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. sicilian
from sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in attica, joliet and
marion penitentiaries. he's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." he's been off smack and everything else
for five years. he's clean and sober. he's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. if you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. if you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

clerk.
