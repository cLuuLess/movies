int. towner living room - on window - night

it's gray muslin drapes blow   in to camera on the night
wind. slowly we track left    into the draperies and shadows.
it's eerie. suddenly a face    is there. it's neil, flattened
against the wall, his .45 in   his hand.

wide

neil flashes his penlight around the room.      nothing.
