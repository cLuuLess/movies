            you're going to wait for me for
            a week. i'll buy a week with
            the five. it's above and beyond
            the fifty and if i wash, you
            keep it.
                (beat)
            you're going to wait for me 'cause
            you want me to take it down.
            you know it's got better odds
            with me in.
                (pause)
            now do we have an understanding?

michael and elaine cerrito, chris and charlene, towner and
his wife anna - a striking black woman we'll see later -
sit around the table and sing "happy anniversary" to the
tune of "happy birthday" as a chinese waiter brings elaine
and michael cerrito a cake; neil returns.

                        voices
            ...happy anniversary to you.
            happy anniversary dear michael
            and elaine. happy anniversary
            to you.

everyone applauds and laughs and raises glasses of plum
wine except cerrito who drinks club soda. elaine and
michael blow out the candles.
