                         bartender
                 (tired smile)
             once again?

                         waingro
                 (feeling good now)
             sure, good buddy. set it up.

bartender

pours and waingro knocks it back, watches the asian dancer
and pops a five and a ten to him across the bar.

another woman takes waingro's eyes. he spins around on
his bar stool and grabs her arm as she passes. big smile.
its...

lillian

breedan's woman. she, too, is a dancer and her shift's
over. she's wearing a raincoat over tights and a sweatshirt
she jerks her arm away.

                       lillian
               (heavy)
          get your fucking hand off my
          arm!

waingro backs way off and shrugs.    lillian leaves.
