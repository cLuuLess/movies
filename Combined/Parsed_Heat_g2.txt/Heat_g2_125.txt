int. van zant office - on van zant - day

he's checking a computer print-out against a ledger sheet.
he looks like he's been sleeping in his clothes. his door
opens. he's startled.

hugh benny

in an iridescent gold suit no tie - sticks his head in.
he breaks the ankles of people who - for the most part -
work for a living and have fallen behind on a juice loan.
he looks the part.

                         hugh
             hear from him yet?

                            van zant
             not a thing.

                         hugh
             maybe he went away.

                         van zant
                 (sarcastic)
             yeah. sure.
                 (beat)
             not hearing bothers me more...
                 (an afterthought)
             where's this guy?

hugh gestures down the corridor.

waingro

enters.

                         van zant
             i been living in this office day
             and night. what's with your
             friend?

                         waingro
             i know all about how he thinks.
             we took some major scores
             together. he's probably busy
             right now. but he's real
             thorough. he won't forget you...

                         van zant
                 (wry)
             that's reassuring.

                         waingro
             yeah, i got some moves i could
             make here, that could be a big
             help to you...
