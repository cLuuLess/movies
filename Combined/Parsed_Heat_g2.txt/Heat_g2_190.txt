               (into phone)
           it's me. tracks back to this
           union guy, van zant. he had
           some beef with neil. neil already
           settled it. van zant got dead
           earlier tonight.
               (pause)
           now hugh benny has reformed his
           wayward life and become a born-
           again good citizen. so, he's
           revealed the key player is this
           cowboy waingro. used to be part
           of neil's crew. waingro committed
           a double murder today on towner,
           a driver, and his old lady.
               (pause)
           meanwhile waingro's checked into
           the airport hyatt house under
           "jamieson." maybe neil will make
           a move on him, but not likely.
               (pause)
           get the word to bailbondsmen,
           bookies, snitches in county,
           etc. where waingro is. and get
           a team down there to set it up.
