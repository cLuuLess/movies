a monolith with alienating foregrounds. a bus pulls in on
beverly. neil mccauley and a nurse get off. neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
at 42 his short black hair is graying. he spent eight
years in mcneil and three in san quentin. he got out and
hit the street in 1987. four of the mcneil years were
spent in the hole. neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. he's very careful and very
good. neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. and if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. his lifestyle is obsessively functional. there's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. neil mccauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.
