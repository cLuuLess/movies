int. shower - hanna

is in it. the water streams off his body. the glass is
misted. he turns off only the hot and breathes fast in
the cold spray. off screen a cigarette lighter clicks.

bedroom - justine

smoking, still under the white sheets, watches hanna dress.

                      justine
          ... taking me out to breakfast?

                      hanna
              (looks at watch)
          can't. bosko's waiting..

          hi vincent. mom, where's my
          barrettes?

lauren, justine's daughter, is 15 and tall and anxious.

                         hanna
          hi, sweetie.

                      justine

                      hanna
              (to lauren in other
               room)

             daddy's picking me up! we're
             going to see the new site and
             then shopping and lunch.
                 (beat)
             they're not on the table.

                         justine
             then i don't know...
                 (to hanna)
             he's already half an hour late.

                         hanna
             he gonna show? or the son of a
             bitch gonna stand her up like
             last time?

hanna clips a 2" .38 in his waistband.       justine shrugs and
shakes her head.

                         justine
                 (starting out of
                  bed)
             want the coffee?

                         hanna
             i'm out of time...

he leaves.

                         justine
             falls back on the pillow,
             disappointed. it's as if she'd
             been stood-up. the bed sheet
             falls half off of her. she's
             exposed, vulnerable. she looks
             out the window, occluded by light
             muslin, away from us and exhales.
