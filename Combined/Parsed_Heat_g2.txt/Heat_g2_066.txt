crosses to the bathroom and turns on the water. he advances
on charlene who's backing up.- she falls over a waste can.

                      neil

                      neil
          listen...

neil kicks the waste can out of the way.    it clatters across
the room.

                      neil
              (continuing)
          we got to know who he is!

                      charlene
          nobody, neil! a liquor wholesaler
          from las vegas. alan marciano.

                      neil
          what he tell you? how connected
          he is? get you a spot in a show?

                      charlene

neil closes in.

                      neil

          with you. and you ...

                      charlene

                      neil
          i'm not part of your situation!

charlene gets attentive.   she's backed into the corner and
can't get any smaller.

                      neil
              (continuing)

          two big jobs back-to-bick. you
          will give chris this shot.
              (beat)
          after that, he fucks up, then
          okay.

          separate, myself. dominick will
          go with you. and my word counts.

          all on the line. so for the
          three of you, you are goin', to

neil grabs the whole lower part of her face in one hand.
his face is inches from hers.

                      neil
              (continuing; quietly)
          now that is what it is gonna be
          .

charlene hesitates; then acquiesces.

                      charlene
              (quietly)
          all right.
