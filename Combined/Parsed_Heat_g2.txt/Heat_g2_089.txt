int. men's room of chinese restaurant - close on faucet -
night

it's a loud torrent - tilt up to three shot: neil, cerrito
and chris are clustered around the sink. the water runs
seemingly aimlessly. it also would drown out a bug.

                      neil
              (loud over water)
          we'll down platinum through nate.
          the deal is 72% of today's quote
          on the bourse in the new york
          times.

                      cerrito
              (loud over water)
          you got the black boxes for the
          alarms?

                       chris
              (loud over water)
          yeah. towner delivered.   they're
          in the drop.

                      neil
              (loud over water)
          we pass by couple times tomorrow
          afternoon. check nothing strange
          in the neighborhood. tomorrow
          night: we take it down. you set
          on the rear door.

                      chris
              (loud over water)
          i'm going to punch it...
              (beat)
          what do we do about van zant?

                      neil
              (loud over water)
          kill him...after the score.

                       chris
              (loud)
          kelso?

                      neil
              (loud)
          we'll use nate's advance off the
          platinum when i down the merch
          to pay kelso for the bank package.

neil turns off the water and they leave.
