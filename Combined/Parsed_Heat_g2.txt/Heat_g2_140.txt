int. towner's house kitchen - towner's pickup - day

approaches, parks. he cuts the engine.       footsteps.   then
towner enters his living room.

                           waingro (o.s.)
            they buy it?

waingro

is revealed leaning against the door jam to the rear
bedroom. he straightens his clothes. a baseball bat rests
against the wall.

                           towner
            yeah.

                        waingro

a bamboo bar with a 9mm. beretta in his waistband.

                (wry)
            thanks. where's anna?

                        waingro
            she's resting. it's going down
            anyway? on schedule?

                        towner
            that's right.

                        waingro
                (to hugh)
            make the call.

hugh crosses to the phone.

                           towner
            where's she?

                           waingro
            i dunno.

            know what happens when neil finds
            out? to both of us?

                        waingro
            i know what's gonna happen.
            nothing's gonna happen. 'cause i
            got it master minded. i got it
            jammed. this is solid. take it
            from the kid.

                        towner
            you hope.
                (pause)
            what do you mean, you don't know
            where she is?

towner looks at hugh.

hugh

dialing the phone - stares at towner with a blank look.

towner

fear blossoms. he races to the bathroom off the kitchen
from which waingro entered.

               back)
          ...showing her a good time.

we see anna's arm on the floor. waingro's picked up the
baseball bat he rested against the door jamb.
