231 ext. boat deck, port side / roof of officers' quarters

lightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is trying to get
collapsible b down from the roof. they slide it down a pair of oars leaned
against the deck house.

                                lightoller

hold it! hold it!

the weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the deck, upside
down. the two swedish cousins, olaus and bjorn gunersen, jump back as the
boat nearly hits them.

                                                                   cut to:
