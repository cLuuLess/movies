79 int. upper landing / grand staircase and a-deck

jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out
before him. overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelier
at its center. sweeping down six stories is the first class grand
staircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time.

and the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaborate
hairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen in evening dress, standing
with one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly.

jack descends to a deck. several men nod a perfunctory greeting. he nods
back, keeping it simple. he feels like a spy.

cal comes down the stairs, with ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry. they
both walk right past jack, neither one gecognizeing him. cal nods at him,
one gent to another. but jack barely has time to be amused. because just
behind cal and ruth on the stairs is rose, a vision in red and black, her
low-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in white
gloves that come well above above the elbow. jack is hypnotized by her
beauty.

close on rose as she approaches jack. he imitates the gentlemen's stance,
hand behind his back. she extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissing
the back of her fingers. rose flushes, beaming noticeably. she can't take
her eyes off him.

                                   rose

cal, surely you remember mr. dawson.

                                    cal

                            (caught off guard)

dawson! i didn't recognize you.

                               (studies him)

amazing! you could almost pass for a gentlemen.

                                                                   cut to:
