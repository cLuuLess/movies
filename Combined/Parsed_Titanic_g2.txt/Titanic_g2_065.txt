97 int. gymnasium - day

jack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the ripple-glass
window to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the
woman who was riding the bike. rose and jack are alone in the room.

                                   rose

jack, this is impossible. i can't see you.

he takes her by the shoulders.

                                   jack

rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that
you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl
i've ever known and--

                                   rose

jack, i--

                                   jack

no wait. let me try to get this out. you're amazing... and i know i have
nothing to offer you, rose. i know that. but i'm involved now. you jump, i
jump, remember? i can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be
alright.

rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. jack is so open and real... not
like anyone she has ever known.

                                   rose

you're making this very hard. i'll be fine. really.

                                   jack

i don't think so. they've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and
you're goin' to die if you don't break out. maybe not right away, 'cause
you're strong. but sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.

                                   rose

it's not up to you to save me, jack.

                                   jack

you're right. only you can do that.

                                   rose

i have to get back, they'll miss me. please, jack, for both our sakes,
leave me alone.

                                                                   cut to:
