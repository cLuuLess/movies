jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe. rose wades
in, holding the axe above her head.

                                   rose

will this work?

                                   jack

we'll find out.

they are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. he positions the
chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe.
the chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either
side of it.

                                   jack

try a couple practice swings.

rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.

                                   jack

now try to hit the same mark again.

she swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark.

                                   jack

okay, that's enough practice.

he winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. she has to hit a target
about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on
either side.

                                   jack

                              (sounding calm)

you can do it, rose. hit it as hard as you can, i trust you.

jack closes his eyes. so does she.

the axe comes down. k-whang! rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... jack is
grinning with two separate cuffs.

rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.

                                   jack

nice work, there, paul bunyan.

he climbs down into the water next to her. he can't breathe for a second.

                                   jack

shit! excuse my french. ow ow ow, that is cold! come on, let's go.

they wade out into the hall. rose starts toward the stiars going up, but
jack stops her. there is only about a foot of the stairwell opening
visible.

                                   jack

too deep. we gotta find another way out.

                                                                   cut to:
