279 ext. ocean / underwater and surface

bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling
spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them.

280 jack rises into frame f.g. kicking hard for the surface... holding
tightly to rose, pulling her up.

281 at the surface: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. over a
thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. some are
stunned, gasping for breath. others are crying, praying, moaning,
shouting... screaming.

jack and rose surface among them. they barely have time to gasp for air
before people are clawing at them. people driven insane by the water, 4
degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form
death by fire.

a man pushes rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly
trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. jack punches him
repeatedly, pulling her free.

                                   jack

swim, rose! swim!

she tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her
lifejacket. they break out of the clot of people. he has to find some kind
of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water.

                                   jack

keep swimming. keep moving. come one, you can do it.

all about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a
chorus of tormented souls. and beyond that... nothing but black water
stretching to the horizon. the sense of isolation and hopelessness is
overwhelming.

                                                                   cut to:
