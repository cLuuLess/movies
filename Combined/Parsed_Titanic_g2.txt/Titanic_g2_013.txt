23 int. rose's stateroom / keldysh - day

lizzy is unpacking rose's things in the small utilitarian room. rose is
placing a number of framed photos on the bureau, arranging them carefully
next to the fishbowl. brock and bodine are in the doorway.

                                   rose

yes. very nice. have you met my granddaughter, lizzy? she takes care of me.

                                   lizzy

yes. we met just a few minutes ago, grandma. remember, up on deck?

                                   rose

oh, yes.

brock glances at bodine... oh oh. bodine rolls his eyes. rose finishes
arranging her photographs. we get a general glimpse of them: the usual
snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband.
