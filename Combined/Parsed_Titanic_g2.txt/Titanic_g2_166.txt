253 int. boat deck foyer / grand staircase

water raors through the doors and windows, cascading down the stairs like a
rapids. john jacob astor is swept down the marble steps to a-deck, which is
already flooded... a roiling vortex. he grabs the headless cherub at the
bottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it.

astor looks up in time to see the 30 foot glass dome overhead explose
inward with the wave of water washing over it. a niagara of sea water
thunders down into the room, blasting through the first class opulence. it
is the armageddon of elegance.
