286 ext. lifeboats / ocean

in boat 6: ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness.
the first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of
hundreds screaming.

                                 hitchins

they'll pull us right down i tell ya!

                                   molly

aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. come on girls, grab your oars. let's go.

                              (nobody moves)

well come on!

the women won't meet her eyes. they huddle into their ermine wraps.

                                   molly

i don't understand a one of you. what's the matter with you? it's your men
back there! we got plenty a' room for more.

                                 hitchins

if you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!

ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it all out.

287 in boat one: sir cosmo and lucile duff-gordon sit with ten other people
in a boat that is two thirds empty. they are two hundred yards from the
screaming in the darkness.

                            fireman hendrickson

we should do something.

lucile squeezes cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. she is
terrified.

                                 sir cosmo

it's out of the question.

the crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. they hunch guiltily,
hoping the sound will stop soon.

twenty boats, most half full, float in the darkness. none of them make a
move.

                                                                   cut to:
