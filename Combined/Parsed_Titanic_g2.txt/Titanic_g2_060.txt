92 int. gymnasium - day

an edwardian nautilus room. there are machines we recognize, and some
don't. a woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking
rediculous. thomas andrews is leading a small tour group, including rose,
ruth and cal. cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a
well trained stroke.

                                    cal

reminds me of my harvard days.

t.w. mccauley, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white
flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-day
counterpart on an "abflex" infomercial. he hits a switch and a machine with
a saddle on it starts to undulate. rose puts her hand on it, curious.

the electric horse is very popular. we even have an electric camel.

                                 (to ruth)
