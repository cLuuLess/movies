290 ext. ocean / boat 14

the beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as
boat 14 comes toward us.

angle from the boat as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant
trail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a
steerage family. daniel marvin's wooden biograph camera.

then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, the
first bodies come into the torch's beam. the people are dead but not
drowned, killed by the freezing water. some look like they could be
sleeping. others stare with frozen eyes at the stars.

soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. they hit the oars on the
heads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. one seaman throws up.
lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby.

                      (the worst moment of his life)

we waited too long.
