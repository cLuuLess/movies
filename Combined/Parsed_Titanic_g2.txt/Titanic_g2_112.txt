junior wireless operator bride is relaying a message to captain smith from
the cunard liner carpathia.

                                   bride

carpathia says they're making 17 knots, full steam for them, sir.

                                   smith

and she's the only one who's responding?

                                   bride

the only one close, sir. she says they can be here in four hours.

                                   smith

four hours!

the enormity of it hits smith like a sledgehammer blow.

                                   smith

thank you, bride.

he turns as bride exits, and looks out onto the blackness.

my god.

                                                                   cut to:
