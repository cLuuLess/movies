227 int. e-deck corridors

the corridor is awash, about a foot deep. standing against the wall, about
50 feet away, is a little boy, aobut 3. the water swirls around his legs
and he is wailing.

                                   rose

we can't leave him.

jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to
the child. jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--

a torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. in seconds it
is too powerful for them to go against.

                                   jack

come on.

charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with
each footstep. at the end of the hall are heavy double doors. as jack
approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors
right up to the ceiling. the doors groan and start to crack under the tons
of pressure.

                                   jack

back! go back!!

rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a
cross-corridor. a man is coming the other way. he sees the boy in jack's
arms and cries out, grabbing him away from jack. starts cursing him in
russian. he runs on with the boy--

                                   rose

no! not that way! come back!

228 double doors blast open. a wall of water thunders into the corridor.
the father and child disappear instantly.

jack and rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor to
ceiling. it gains on them like a locomotive. they make it to a stairway
going up.

                                                                   cut to:
