jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing.

                                   jack

look for something floating. some debris... wood... anything.

                                   rose

it's so cold.

                                   jack

i know. i know. help me, here. look around.

his words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them.
rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. she turns
and... screams.

a devil is right in from of her face. it is the black french bulldog,
swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes
bugging. it motors past her, like it is headed for newfoundland.

beyond it rose sees somehting in the water.

                                   rose

what's that?

jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. it is a
piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. he pushes her up and she
slithers onto it belly down.

but when jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,
almost dumping rose off. it is clearly only big enough to support her. he
clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best
he can.

their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. a
man swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. jack warns him
back.

                                   jack

it's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under.

                                    man

let me try at least, or i'll die soon.

                                   jack

you'll die quicker if you come any closer.

                                    man

yes, i see. good luck to you then.

                              (swimming off)

god bless.

                                                                   cut to:
