206 ext. boat 6 / titanic - night

ruth rows with molly brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors.
she rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship.

it slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. nothing is above
water forward of the bridge except for the foremast. another rocket goes
off, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outward
from the ship.

207 at the boat deck rail captain smith is shouting to boat 6 through a
large metal megaphone.

                                   smith

come back! come back to the ship!

chief officer wilde joins him, blowing his silver whistle.

208 from boat 6 the whistle comes shrilly across the water. quartermaster
hitchins grips the rudder in fear.

                                 hitchins

the suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.

                                   molly

we got room for lots more. i say we go back.

                                 hitchins

no! it's our lives now, not theirs. and i'm in charge of this boat! now
row!!

209 captain smith, at the rail of the boat deck, lowers his megaphone
slowly

                                   smith

the fools.

                                                                   cut to:
