165 int. rose and cal's suite

from inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the
corridor.

                                   ruth

i had better go dress.

ruth exits and hockley crosses to rose. he regards her coldly for a moment,
then slaps her across the face.

                                    cal

it is a little slut, isn't it?

to rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been
given. cal grabs her shoulders roughly.

                                    cal

look at me, you little--

there is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. the door opens and
their steward puts his head in.

                              steward barnes

sir, i've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up
to the boat deck.

                                    cal

get out. we're busy.

the steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a
dresser.

                                  steward

i'm sorry about the inconvenience, mr. hockley, but it's captain's orders.
please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight.

                       (he hands a lifebelt to rose)

not to worry, miss, i'm sure it's just a precaution.

                                    cal

this is ridiculous.

in the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious
they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. however, it's another
story in...

                                                                   cut to:
