288 ext. ocean

jack and rose drift under the blazing stars. the water is glassy, with only
the faintest undulating swell. rose can actually see the stars reflecting
on the black mirror of the sea.

jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly around
her legs. he rubs her arms. his face is chalk with in the darkness. a low
moaning in the darknes around them.

                                   rose

it's getting quiet.

                                   jack

just a few more minutes. it'll take them a while to get the boats
organized...

rose is unmoving, just staring into space. she knows the truth. there won't
be any boats. behind jack she sees that officer wilde has stopped moving.
he is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. he has died of
exposure already.

                                   jack

i don't know about you, but i intend to write a strongly worded letter to
the white star line about all this.

she laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. rose finds his eyes
in the dim light.

                                   rose

i love you jack.

he takes her hand.

                                   jack

no... don't say your good-byes, rose. don't you give up. don't do it.

                                   rose

i'm so cold.

                                   jack

you're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going
to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady,
warm in your bed. not here. not this night. do you understand me?

                                   rose

i can't feel my body.

                                   jack

rose, listen to me. listen. winning that ticket was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak.

                                   jack

it brought me to you. and i'm thankful, rose. i'm thankful.

his voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart.
but his eyes are unwavering.

                                   jack

you must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will
never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless...
promise me now, and never let go of that promise.

                                   rose

i promise.

                                   jack

never let go.

                                   rose

i promise. i will never let go, jack. i'll never let go.

she grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. it is quiet now,
except for the lapping of the water.

                                                                   cut to:
