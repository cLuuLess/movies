196 int. scotland road / e-deck

the widest passageway in the ship, it is used by crew and steerage alike,
and runs almost the length of the ship. right now steerage passengers move
along it like refugees, heading aft.

crash! a wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open under the
force of jack's shoulder. jack and rose stumble through, into the corridor.
a steward, who was nearby herding people along, marches over.

                                  steward

here you! you'll have to pay for that, you know. that's white star line

                               jack and rose

husband offers them a flask of whiskey.

                                 irishman

rose takes a mighty belt and hands it to jack. he grins and follows suit.
jack tries a number of doors and iron gates along the way, finding them all
locked.

                                                                   cut to:
