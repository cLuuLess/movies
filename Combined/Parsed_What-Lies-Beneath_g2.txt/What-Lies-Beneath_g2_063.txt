int.  president's house - night

...a large cocktail party.  the house is crowded with
professors, administrators, and their spouses.  president
templeton, a frosty-haired, avuncular chap, greets them with
his wife, a sharp looking woman in her late fifties.

                     templeton
          there they are.

                     norman
          you remember my wife, claire.

                     mrs. templeton
               (shaking hands)
          of course.  you must be so proud.

                     claire
          i am.

                     mrs. templeton
               (to norman)
          everyone's very anxious to shake hands
          with our newest academic celebrity.

she takes their coats.  dean templeton leads them in.

                     templeton
          must've been some paper.  your father
          would be very proud.

this seems to strike a nerve.

                     norman
          uh-huh.

claire notices this and squeezes his hand.  templeton leads
norman into a large living room which is filled with
colleagues.  several of them turn and begin clapping.  others
follow suit.
