int.  norman's study - day

she walks in and stands before:

the repaired photograph of herself and norman...at the party
for the dupont chair.

she takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then
smashes it on the edge of the desk.  she extricates the
picture from the broken glass.  the caption reads:

"dr. norman spencer being awarded the distinguished dupont
chair in genetics by dean of sciences torvald ackerman."

she stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over
and scans the stories on the back.  one tells of a hotly
contested city council race, another contains details of a
large alumni donation to the university.

she notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't
noticed before.  it's only a small portion of one column, but
it seems to detail the search for a missing girl.
