int.  bathroom - morning

angle - claire...her face a mask of terror.

                     claire
          oh god...

claire's pov

the bathtub, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the
water blasting.  norman's limp hand pokes through the
curtain.  an electric cord leads from the mirror socket into
the tub.

claire races over and rips the plug from the wall.  she tears
the shower curtain away to find a bluish norman lying,
unconscious in the tub.

                     claire
          no, no.  please no...

she hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a
heartbeat.

                     claire
          norman!!  wake up!  please!

claire shakes him to no effect.

                     claire
          oh god...norman!

she slaps him on the face...once, then twice.  he suddenly
sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns
to life.

                     claire
          it's me...it's me...

sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to
pull him upright.  she discovered her blowdryer in the tub
and hurls it across the room.
