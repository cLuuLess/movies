ext.  hallway - night

claire catches up to the completely spooked jody outside the
work room.  she holds onto her arm.

                     jody
          i have to go.

                     claire
          jody, wait.

cooper's growling in the work room.  they look in.

                     jody
          claire, this is...this is...

claire, transfixed, walks in.
