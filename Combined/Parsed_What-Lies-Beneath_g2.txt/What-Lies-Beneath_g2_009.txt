"juilliard"...now it's on the same t-shirt only claire's
wearing it and she's much younger.  it's an old photograph in
an album.  younger norman stands next to her in the shot, his
arm draped around her waist.  a cello case stands beside her.

claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and
sees propped in the corner...the cello case.  she gazes at
other photos.

-- claire in her wedding dress, norman beside her in a tux
   with a very wide bow-tie.

-- claire and norman in front of a university building.  a
   tiny caitlin rests on her hip.

claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.
