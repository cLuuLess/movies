ext.  backyard - morning

claire sets up a camera and tripod.  she steps back and aims
her camera.  she glances up at a large upstairs window at the
feur's house.  one side of the curtain seems to be pulled
open, but no one's there.

feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  the
morning sun hits the flowers just right and she snaps several
pictures of them against her lovely house.

she glances back at the feur's window.  the curtain is now
closed.

she walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.
when this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers
across the fence.  she can barely see over, but glimpses:

a deep furrow in the mud of the driveway.  just then, a car
pulls into the driveway, claire scrambles down from her
perch.
