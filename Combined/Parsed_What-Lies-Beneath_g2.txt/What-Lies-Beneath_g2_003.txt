int.  room - day

claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:

a lovely, wooded lake.  it couldn't be more picturesque.  a
24' sailboat is moored at the dock and an old stone
lighthouse sits on a point across the lake.

the sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from a figure
still shrouded by covers.

claire sits beside the sleeping form.  she scans the room
briefly, taking in a greenpeace flag and a picture of a
tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.

she gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped
hair and tiny nose ring.  claire leans over and inhales the
sleeping scent of her only daughter, caitlin.  she places her
hand on a cheek.  the girl's eyelids flutter softly.

                     claire
          morning, beauty.

caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.

                     claire
          let's go.  or we'll never leave on time.

from out of the pillow comes caitlin's voice.

                     caitlin
               (muffled)
          i'm totally ready.

claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.

                     claire
          come on, i'll make you some waffles,
          maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the
          mall.
               (beat)
          caitlin...

claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is caitlin's
behind.

                     caitlin
          mother...

claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from
the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.
caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.

                     caitlin
          you're such a morning person.

claire turns at the door.

                     claire
          it is unwise to heckle the keeper of the
          plastic.

she starts to leave.  caitlin calls out.

                     caitlin (o.s.)
          blueberries!

claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.
