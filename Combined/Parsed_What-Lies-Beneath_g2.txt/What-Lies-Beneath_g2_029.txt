int.  norman's study - dusk

claire walks in and sees:

insert-- lying on the floor...a framed newspaper photograph
of norman and claire.

the caption announces that he's being promoted to the
"distinguished dupont chair in genetics."  through the
spiderwebbed glass, norman can be seen shaking hands with an
older academic, hugging a smiling claire to his side.

claire kneels down to gather the picture.  a single shard of
glass is missing.  she finds it a foot away by a distinctive
knot in the wood floor.

she notices a copper glint in the point of glass, but when
she moves it, it's gone.  she places the pieces of broken
glass on the frame and stands.

out of the window directly in front of her sees:  mr. feur,
removing a dirt covered shovel from his trunk.  she glances
down at the picture, then back up at mr. feur, who carries
the shovel around back.

                     claire
          oh no...

claire wraps up the broken picture.  she hears a car door
slam and glances out the window in time to see mr. feur
driving off.
