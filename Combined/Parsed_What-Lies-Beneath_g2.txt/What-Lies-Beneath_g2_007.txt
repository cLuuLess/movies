int.  norman and claire's room - night

claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton
nightgown.  norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.

she gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him
and starts reading.  after a moment:

                     norman
          whatcha reading?

                     claire
               (reading the cover, sexy voice)
          genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic
          organisms.

                     norman
               (slight smile)
          how is it?

claire snuggles up.

                     claire
          excellent.  couple of swedish sailor cells
          just gang divided a virginal cheerleader
          cell.

                     norman
               (lost in his book)
          nice.
               (beat)
          almost done.

she pulls slightly away.

                     claire
          if you have to work...

                     norman
          no, no.  i'm just about...
               (beat)
          there.

he places his book on the bedside table and turns to her.

                     norman
          how are you?

                     claire
          fine.

                     norman
          it's okay if you're not.

                     claire
          i am, really.

                     norman
          it's just she's been the focus for a
          while.

                     claire
          not the focus.

                     norman
          you know what i mean.

claire thinks for a moment.

                     claire
          to tell you the truth...i'm
          excited.

                     norman
          you are...

                     claire
          to get my life back.  to have some time
          for myself.  some time for us.

he caresses her.

                     norman
          you did a great job.  she's a good kid.

                     claire
          we did.

there's a weighty pause.

                     norman
          it's just us now.

                     claire
          i know.

he kisses her.

                     norman
          tired?

                     claire
          nope.

                     norman
          wanna fool around?

                     claire
          yup.

they start to kiss.  it's slow and a bit methodical in the
manner of long time lovers.  suddenly, the sound of a woman
wailing can be heard.  they stop.

                     norman
          did you...

                     claire
          shhh.

they listen.  the sounds start to become louder.  it is
clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and
savage love making.

                     norman
          jesus.

he walks over and closes the window.  it doesn't help.

                     norman
          i guess they're making up.

the woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.

                     claire
          what is he doing to her?

they lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.

                     norman
          and we moved out here for the quiet.

                     claire
          mmm.

beat.  the mood has passed.

                     norman
          maybe we should just...

                     claire
          tomorrow.

                     norman
          i'm finished at three.  no.  squash with
          stan.

                     claire
          after that.

                     norman
          i'll be there.

beat.

                     norman
          love you.

she smiles.

                     claire
          night.

they lie together in the darkness as the feurs finally
climax.
