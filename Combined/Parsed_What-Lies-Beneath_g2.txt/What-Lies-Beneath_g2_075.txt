int.  madison's room - day

claire enters the room.  her face freezes.

angle

several posters for alternative and metal bands, side by side
with academic plaques and awards.

                     mrs. frank
          full scholarships.  princeton too.  she
          wanted to stay close.

                     claire
          you must have been very proud.

she nods.  claire moves along looking at pictures.  some with
different men, others with rough looking friends.  claire
stops at a picture tucked into a mirror.

insert

madison singing at a recital of some kind.  she's lovely,
with striking green eyes.  around her neck is a distinctive
silver necklace, with a perfectly wrought, silver rosebud.

                     mrs. frank
          such a pretty voice.  surprised she didn't
          major in music.
               (beat)
          that's the last picture.

a phone rings in the hallway.

                     mrs. frank
          s'cuse me.

claire's eye is pulled past the picture into the mirror, the
reflection of something pinned to the edge of a bulletin
board.  she turns and moves over to:

a short blond braid.  she reaches out to touch it.  claire
hears footsteps.  mrs. frank leans back into the room.

                     mrs. frank
          they're calling me in to work.

                     claire
          i should be going anyway.
