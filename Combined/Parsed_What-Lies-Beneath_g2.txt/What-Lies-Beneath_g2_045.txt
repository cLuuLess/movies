int.  dr. drayton's office - day

claire sits in a comfortable looking chair with her purse in
her lap, arms crossed.

                     dr. drayton (o.s.)
               (a smooth, mellifluous
                baritone)
          who's idea was it?

                     claire
          mine.  his.  we both...thought...

she trails off.  camera slowly pulls back to reveal, dr.
timothy drayton, a stocky, light skinned black man in his
late forties with a kind face and piercing brown eyes.

                     claire
          i didn't want to come.

                     dr. drayton
          then why did you?

                     claire
          because he was worried about me.

                     dr. drayton
          your husband?

                     claire
          yes.
               (beat)
          i'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full
          of prozac so he can live out his life in
          peace.

                     dr. drayton
          do you really think so?

                     claire
          no.

there's a pause.

                     dr. drayton
          why is he worried?

                     claire
          because, i don't know, because
          sometimes...sometimes i forget
          things...and ever since caitlin left,
          ever since my daughter left for school,
          there've been...i fainted and...
               (beat)
          why is this so hard?

dr. drayton takes a little silver bowl full of shiny, red
fireballs next to his chair.  he proffers it to claire.

                     dr. drayton
          fireball?

                     claire
          you're joking.

he shakes his head.  she shrugs, then grabs one and pops it
into her mouth.

                     dr. drayton
          it's hard because i'm a complete stranger
          and what we're talking about is
          incredibly personal.  besides, the first
          time most people come here, a part of
          them is wondering if i'm gonna think
          they're crazy.

she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods.

                     dr. drayton
          don't worry, i'm required to have at
          least three sessions in order to commit.

her eyes get a little wider.

                     dr. drayton
          now that's a joke.

she manages an unsteady smile.

                     dr. drayton
          i have some training at helping people
          through the stressful moments in life,
          one of which you may or may not be
          experiencing.  if you want to get some
          stuff off your chest, great.  if not...

he smiles and shrugs, "no problem."  she stares at him for a
moment.

                     claire
               (re: fireball)
          these are good.

                     dr. drayton
          mm-hmm.

she studies him for a moment.

                     claire
          there's a ghost in my house.

he nods slightly, as if she's told him, "i have some
anxiety."  claire goes on.

                     claire
          she finished my solitaire game and turned
          on the radio...she likes rock and roll.
          angry rock and roll.

                     dr. drayton
          how do you know it's a she?

                     claire
          i saw her in the water.  beside me.  she
          was filling the bathtub.

                     dr. drayton
          what does she look like?

                     claire
          pretty.  she's a blond.

                     dr. drayton
          do you have any idea who she is?

                     claire
          um...i'd rather not say...just yet.

                     dr. drayton
          fine.

                     claire
          what do you think i should do?

he thinks for a moment, then:

                     dr. drayton
          try to contact her.

claire nearly swallows her fireball.

                     claire
          what?

                     dr. drayton
          try to communicate with her somehow.

                     claire
          you think that'll help?

                     dr. drayton
          can't hurt.  and i think it's important
          you find out what she wants.

claire ponders this for a moment, then looks back up at him.

                     claire
          are you humoring me?

                     dr. drayton
          nope.

she seems satisfied by his sincerity.

                     claire
          how?

                     dr. drayton
          i don't know.  my aunt used to use my
          uncle's old pajamas and a candle.

he stands.  claire nods, then stands.  she smiles too.

                     claire
          is this time okay?

he nods.
