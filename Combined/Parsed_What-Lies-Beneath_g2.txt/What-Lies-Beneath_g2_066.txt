ext.  templeton's house - night

claire and norman walk toward the car.

                     norman
          you don't remember?

                     claire
          when she said it, there was something
          familiar...but no.

he looks at her for a moment.

                     norman
          you dropped a glass.

                     claire
          i...

                     norman
          a cheap wine glass from the caterers.  you
          started crying.  i tried to comfort you...

                     claire
               (something's triggered)
          in the living room...

                     norman
          you shoved me away and ran out to the
          patio.  i took you home.

                     claire
          but why?  i can't understand how i could
          just completely--

                     norman
          it was maybe a week after the accident.
          we were moving.  it was a hard time.

                     claire
          but i don't remember.

                     norman
          sweetheart, it was over a year ago.

                     claire
          what's wrong with me?

he stops, takes her shoulders gently.

                     norman
               (reassuring)
          nothing.  nothing at all.  it's been a
          hard year.  but you're better now.  and
          things are really looking up for us.  so
          let's try to enjoy that.
               (gently)
          please?

she thinks for a beat.

                     claire
          yes.  yes.  that's what i want.

she takes his hand and kisses it.
