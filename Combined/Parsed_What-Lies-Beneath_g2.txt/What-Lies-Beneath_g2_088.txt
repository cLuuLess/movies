int.  bedroom - day

claire sits beside norman on the bed as two e.m.t.'s, an old
guy and a heavy woman pack up.  stan's on the phone, jody off
to one side.

                     heavy woman
          vitals are good.  i'd take it easy for a
          couple of days.

                     norman
          thanks.

the e.m.t.'s leave as stan hangs up.

                     stan
          they'll take you for a cat scan tomorrow
          if you're feeling dizzy at all.

                     norman
          that won't be necessary.   

he glances at claire as he walks stan out.

                     norman
          not unless there's a miracle drug for
          clumsiness.

they leave.

                     claire
          jody, she tried to kill him.

                     jody
          i know.

                     claire
          i can't believe this is happening.

                     jody
          we need help.  please let me call the
          medium.

                     claire
          that could take days.  i need to do
          something now.  don't you see?  she wants
          us dead.

jody thinks for a moment.

                     jody
          alight, alright.  stay calm.  you opened
          this door.  there's got to be a way that
          you can close it.

                     claire
          like what?

                     jody
          i have an idea.  but, i mean, i'm just
          making this up...

                     claire
          what is it?
