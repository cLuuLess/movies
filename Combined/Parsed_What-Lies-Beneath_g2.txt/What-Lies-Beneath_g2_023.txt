int.  norman's lab - night

claire walks in to find norman surrounded by several grad
students.  at school he's a very different man; pressed shirt
and tie, hair neatly brushed back.  they're preforming some
unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.
she stops by the door to watch him.

                     norman
          ...and then what...courtney?

an intense asian girl answers.

                     courtney
          we administer the halothane.

                     norman
          dosage?

she glances at her notes.

                     courtney
          three point five cc's.

                     norman
          excellent.  properties?  andrew from
          downtown...

andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.

                     andrew
          an organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,
          which when administered in aerosol form
          temporarily renders the subject immobile.

                     norman
          nothing but net.

he measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an
apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.

                     norman
          prudence here's an old friend.

he moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to
courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  the sheep
suddenly goes completely still.  norman moves around and
begins a brief procedure.

                     norman
          i try to stay on her good side because i
          owe her my career and most of our grant
          money.  why else?

he completes the procedure.  they look at him blankly.

                     norman
          always do unto others as you'd have
          others do unto your ewe.

groans, laughter.  he stops claire.

                     norman
          that'll do it.  write this up for tuesday!

andrew and amy tend to prudence, the rest leave.  claire
moves over to him.  they kiss.  norman packs notes and some
of the chemicals into a leather case.

                     norman
               (warm)
          what are you doing here?

                     claire
          there were some noises.  i didn't want to
          disturb you.

she watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led
out of the room.

                     norman
          what do you mean?  some noises where?

                     claire
          in the house.  i was scared.

                     norman
          did you call the police?

                     claire
          no.  can you drive me home?  i'll bring you
          back in the morning.

                     norman
          of course.

he takes her arm.
