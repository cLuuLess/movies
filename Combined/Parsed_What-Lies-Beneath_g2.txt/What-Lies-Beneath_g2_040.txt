int.  work room - day

claire walks into the work room with the portable phone to
her ear and a cup of jody's special tea.  she sniffs it and
makes a face as she turns on the computer.  after several
rings a girl picks up on the other end.

                     claire
               (on phone)
          caitlin?

                     girl's voice
               (overlapping)
          can you hang up?  i'm trying to make a
          call.

the line goes dead.  claire hits redial and gets...a busy
signal.  she clicks the phone off as the computer boots up.
claire puts the phone down and starts a game of alice's
solitaire.  she turns a card and waits.

                     claire
          gee, that's tricky.  sure could use some
          help.

she waits, the cursor blinks benignly.

                     claire
          come on...

nothing happens.
