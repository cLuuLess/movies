ext.  columbia university - day

claire's frozen in the hug.

                     caitlin
               (beat)
          mom.

her eyes open.  widen to reveal claire, holding caitlin on
the college campus.  the urban skyline looms in the
background.

                     caitlin
          i have'ta go.

after a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  caitlin
glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed
this overt display of maternal affection.

                     caitlin
          i'll call you.

claire produces an envelope, which she presses into her
daughter's hand.  it's a book of train tickets.

                     claire
          come home anytime.

caitlin looks at norman.

                     norman
          really gonna leave me, huh?

she nods.  they share a tender look.

                     norman
          be good.

she throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  a bit
overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of
caitlin's head.  after a moment, she steps back...

                     caitlin
          bye.

...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old
columbia dorm.  a banner is draped across its portals which
reads:

                  "welcome class of '04."

claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly
shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  her
eyes are shining.  norman wraps an arm around her waist as
she daps at a tear with a kleenex.

                     claire
               (smiling)
          i almost made it.

they turn and head for the car.  claire sneaks one last look
over her shoulder.

caitlin glancing back at claire with an apprehensive smile.
