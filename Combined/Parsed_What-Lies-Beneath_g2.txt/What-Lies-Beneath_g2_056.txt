ext.  porch - day

claire's carrying some cuttings into the house.  she hears a
knock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...mrs.
feur.  the real one.

                     mrs. feur
          i wanted to apologize.

                     claire
          you do?

                     mrs. feur
          for scaring you like i did.  when i
          thought about what that must have seemed
          like that day...

                     claire
          and then you weren't there.

                     mrs. feur
          right.  i'm sorry.

there's an awkward pause.

                     claire
          would you like some iced tea?

                     mrs. feur
          very much.

claire leads her toward the house.
