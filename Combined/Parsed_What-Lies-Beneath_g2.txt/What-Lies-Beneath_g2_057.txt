ext.  porch - day

claire pours mrs. feur a glass of iced tea from a pitcher.
she's small and delicate looking with big, watery eyes.

                     mrs. feur
          your house is so beautiful.

                     claire
          thank you.

                     mrs. feur
          and these roses.  they're much prettier
          up close.

she regards mrs. feur for a moment.  she seems skittish and
shy.

                     claire
          i...there's something i have to ask
          you.

mrs. feur waits.

                     claire
          that day...at the fence.  you seemed
          terrified.  i don't think i was imagining
          that.

there's a pause.  mrs. feur looks down into her lap.

                     mrs. feur
          no.

                     claire
          of what?  what were you so afraid of?

                     mrs. feur
          you're going to think i'm crazy or
          something.

a tiny smile.

                     claire
          not this week.

she looks away for a moment, then looks back at claire.

                     mrs. feur
          love.

                     claire
          what?

                     mrs. feur
          have you ever felt so completely consumed
          by a feeling for someone that you
          couldn't breathe?  that the time together
          is so passionate and consuming that you
          felt physical pain when they would leave?

                     claire
          um...sure.

                     mrs. feur
          i couldn't catch my breath.  that's not a
          metaphor, that's...and i panicked.  i
          never dreamed anyone would hear me back
          there...
               (beat)
          i tried to leave him.  went to my mother's
          in boston.  he brought my things up and
          pleaded with me to come home.

claire is mesmerized.

                     mrs. feur
          you must think i'm pathetic.

                     claire
          no.  no, i don't.

                     mrs. feur
          i'm sorry that i frightened you like
          that.  but i was so touched by your
          concern.  i've been lonely here.
               (beat)
          perhaps we could be friends.

claire stares at this strange, passionate woman.

                     claire
          i would like that.

mrs. feur smiles at her.
