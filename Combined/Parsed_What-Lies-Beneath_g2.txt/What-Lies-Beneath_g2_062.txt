ext.  cbgb's - night

the last groups of young people file out of the club.  a
couple of them glance at claire, who seems very out of place
standing on the bowery late at night.

                     voice (o.s.)
          mom?

she turns to see caitlin standing before her, a bass guitar
case on a strap over her shoulder.  there's an awkward pause.

                     claire
          that was very good.

                     caitlin
          mom, i'm sorry.  i wanted to tell you.
          but it never felt right.

                     claire
          why?

caitlin stares at the ground.

                     caitlin
          i didn't want to bring up memories.  i
          didn't want to do anything that might
          make you regret your choices.

claire winces silently.

                     caitlin
          besides, dad would have freaked.

                     claire
          no, he wouldn't.

                     caitlin
          i think playing in a band called "bitch"
          might put a dent in the whole "perfect
          family" thing.

                     claire
          that's not true.

                     caitlin
          yes it is.  can we please not do that?
          please?  cause it is.

claire doesn't disagree.

                     claire
          he loves you very much.  he just--

                     caitlin
          i know he does.

beat.  claire studies her surprisingly strong daughter.

                     caitlin
          are you mad at me?

                     claire
          listen to me.  the one thing in life that
          i definitely don't regret...is the choice.
          i made to be your mother.

they hug.  for a moment, claire's got her little girl back.
her eyes well up.

                     claire
          i miss you.

                     caitlin
          so much.

                     claire
               (laughing)
          it got so bad your father almost had to
          put me away.

                     caitlin
          what do you mean?

                     claire
          i started seeing things.

                     caitlin
          a ghost?

beat.  claire stares at her daughter.

                     claire
          did you?

                     caitlin
          no.  but once i heard...

                     claire
          what?

                     caitlin
          someone crying.  a girl.
               (beat)
          i thought i was crazy.

                     claire
               (quietly)
          then we both are.

caitlin nods.
