int.  restaurant - night

a cozy, candlelit italian place in town.  claire and norman
arrive at the table.  stan rises.  the chair next to him is
empty.  he kisses her cheek.

                     claire
          hi stan.  sorry we're late.
               (too earnest)
          it was my fault.

she greets stan, a friendly looking man in his forties.

                     stan
          we just got here.

claire flashes a semi-playful look back at norman.

                     claire
          where's the new squeeze?

a voice speaks out from behind her.

                     voice
          here i am.

claire turns to find a tall, elegant brunette standing behind
her.  the woman's face registers some shock.

                     stan
          i'd like you to meet...

                     claire
          elena?

                     elena
          ohmigod...

the two women embrace, then beam at each other.

                     claire
          wow.

                     elena
          this is...

                     claire
               (to norman)
          we know each other.

                     norman
          hope so.

later

post meal.  several empty wine bottle decorate the table.

                     elena
          we had this finnish conductor, aki, laki,
          something.  he had these ridiculous bangs.
          and he'd sweep them off with his baton
          every minute or so, and it drove us
          insane, remember?

claire nods.

                     claire
          he looked like one of the monkees.

                     elena
          anyway, claire slept with him...

                     claire
          i didn't sleep with him.

                     elena
          ...just so she could cut them off.

                     claire
          he was so pissed.

                     elena
          i came in from my room...

                     claire
               (interjecting)
          we were suite mates.

                     elena
          and there's this brilliant conductor in
          purple briefs with no bangs cursing his
          ass off in finnish.

                     claire
          oh god...

they dissolve into giggles.  norman and stan smile.

                     stan
          well...

                     norman
               (to stan)
          i made an honest woman out of her.

elena puts her hand on claire's.

                     elena
               (to stan)
          you should have heard her play.

                     claire
          stop.

                     elena
          we both auditioned for the philharmonic.
          one cello position open.

                     claire
          do we have to?

                     elena
          and i kicked ass.  my best stuff.  then i
          stood in the hallway and listened to her
          audition...and i cried.

                     claire
          she's making this up.

                     elena
          i'm not.  couldn't pick up my cello for
          weeks.

                     stan
          what happened?

elena looks at claire, then smiles.

                     elena
          she got it.
               (beat)
          turned it down.

                     claire
          i met a dashing young grad student after a
          recital one night...

claire puts her arm around norman.

                     claire
          ...and three months later i was married.

he squeezes her hand.
