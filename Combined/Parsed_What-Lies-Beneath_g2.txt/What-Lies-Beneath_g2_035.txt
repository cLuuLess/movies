int.  upstairs - night

claire turns off the lights and crouches down.  she raises a
pair of binoculars.

pov - binoculars

claire rakes the binoculars across the feur's house...past
their car parked in front until she finds a light on
downstairs.

the tall, powerfully built mr. feur walks into the room and
sits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for
one.  he eats a tv dinner, slowly chewing and staring
straight ahead.  he sips from a can of beer.

just then...a hand grabs claire's arm.  she lets out a
screech and turns to see norman standing beside her.

                     norman
          what are you doing?

she glances back out the window and sees mr. feur standing
at the window, paging the curtain.  she squats down, pulling
norman with her.

                     claire
               (shrill whisper)
          get down!  he'll see.

                     norman
               (also whispers)
          what's going on, claire?

                     claire
          shhhh.

she peers over the sill in time to see mr. feur turning away
from the window.  she takes norman by the hand and leads him
downstairs.
