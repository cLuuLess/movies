int.  bathroom - day

claire enters the steamy bathroom.  the tub is nearly
overflowing with water.  she squats down to drain the tub.

she stops, feeling watched, then slowly peers behind her...no
one's there.  claire reaches toward the water to yank the
plug's chain, then freezes.  in the bathwater's still
reflection she see:

a pretty young blond standing beside her.  startled, she pops
up and slams into the shower head.

claire collapses over the side of the tub, her head dipping
underwater.  a small cloud of red surrounds her.  moments
later, an arm wraps around her.

                                                      cut to:

blurry shapes.

                     voice (o.s.)
          claire...
