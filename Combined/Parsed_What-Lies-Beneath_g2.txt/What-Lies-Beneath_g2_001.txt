int.  bathroom - day

a hazy shape-- accompanied by a whirring sound.

a steam covered mirror is cleared with a blow dryer.  claire
starts to come into focus.  the dryer stops.  she presses the
red g.f.i. button on the socket.  zap!  a big blue spark
shoots out.  claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer
starts whirring again.

she clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  she
regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-
looking woman around forty.

claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable scar
above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,
as if confirming her existence.
