int.  pickup - night

the truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  she stares
at the door for signs of norman.

                     claire
          come on...come on...

...and vroom, the truck roars to life.  claire spews gravel
as she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway,
constantly watching the door.

when she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks
into the rear view mirror.  the boat momentarily blocks the
open door, then clears.  still nothing.
