int.  dining room - night

claire and norman eat dinner.  a rainstorm pelts the windows.

                     norman
          of what?

                     claire
          of him i think.

                     norman
          did she say that?

                     claire
          more or less.

norman chews.

                     norman
          honey, they're young.  they're probably
          newlyweds.

                     claire
          i'm telling you.  there was something in
          her voice...

                     norman
          remember how we were?

                     claire
          not like this.  we were never like this.
               (beat)
          i want to go over there.  after dinner, we
          can--

                     norman
          why?

                     claire
          to make sure she's all right.

norman puts down his fork.

                     norman
          claire, honey, we are not going to march
          next door and accuse our new neighbor of--

                     claire
               (overlapping)
          that's not what i'm sug--

                     norman
          ...when tonight they'll probably be
          keeping us awake.

                     claire
          but what if something happens?

                     norman
          claire...

                     claire
          i'd never be able to live with mysel--

                     norman
               (reassuring)
          nothing's going to happen.
               (beat)
          besides, i have to work tonight.  the
          conference is in less than two weeks.
          i've got to stay focused on that for just
          a little longer.
               (beat)
          this is...

                     claire
          i know.

                     norman
          it's what i've been working for.

she glances down at her untouched plate.

                     claire
          i just wish you could have heard her.

                     norman
          look, i'll call harvey tomes in the psych
          department, see what i can find out.

                     claire
          promise?

he gives her a "didn't i just say so" look.  she smiles.

                     claire
          i'll make you some coffee.

she reaches for his plate to clear it.  norman grabs her hand
and kisses it.
