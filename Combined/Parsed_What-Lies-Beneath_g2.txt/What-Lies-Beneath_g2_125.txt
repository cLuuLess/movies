ext.  cemetery - day

a casket

widen to reveal claire, dressed in black, stepping away from
the grave.  a tiny arm snakes around her waist.  she glances
down to see caitlin, her eyes shining, clasping her mother
tightly.  claire takes a last look into the grave.

                     claire
          rest in peace.

the gravestone - madison elizabeth frank

mother and daughter turn and step back.  next to them, also
in black, is mrs. frank.

                                                      cut to:

fingers

racing across the neck of a cello.  the solo continues and
now reaches the difficult transition that had stumped claire
before.

widen to reveal
