int.  a living room - night

claire, her hair short and sexy, eyes tightly shut, brow
beaded with sweat.  the piece builds to a dark, passionate
crescendo.

her eyes remain shut for a moment, then flutter open.

claire's pov

a new york apartment, the glimmering skyline visible through
a large window.  cooper gazes up attentively.

claire sips a glass of wine, her face unsmiling, but serene.
