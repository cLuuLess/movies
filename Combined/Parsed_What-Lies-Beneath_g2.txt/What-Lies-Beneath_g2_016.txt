int.  norman's study - day

but the whispering has suddenly stopped.

                     claire
          hello?

the lovely circular room is completely empty.  she looks
around, puzzled.  cooper, the family's aging lab, casually
ambles over.

                     claire
               (to cooper)
          please tell me you heard that.
