int.  foyer - night

the foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  claire
nervously walks out and looks around.

                     claire
          cooper!

pov - the garden

no sign of the dog.

claire turns to go back inside.  when she touches the
doorknob, she hears the whispering again.  a fleeting shadow
draws her eye to a coat rack mirror which reflects directly
into the study.

                     claire
          hello...?!

the whispering stops.
