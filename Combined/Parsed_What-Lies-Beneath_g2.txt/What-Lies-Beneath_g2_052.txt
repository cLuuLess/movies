ext.  lab building - night

norman nods to a security guard as he leaves a darkened
university building.  he sees claire standing at the foot of
the steps.

                     norman
          what are you doing out here?

                     claire
          he killed her.  i'm not crazy.  he killed
          her and--

                     norman
          this is the feur thing?

                     claire
          yes.  and he's going to get away with it.

norman's momentarily speechless.

                     norman
          how do you know this?

                     claire
          we had a seance.

                     norman
          who did?

                     claire
          jody and i.  and she was there, norman,
          she was.  it scared jody so bad she had to
          leave.

                     norman
          how did you--

                     claire
          jody brought a ouija board and we
          summoned her.

he regards her for a moment.

                     norman
          are you angry at me?

this stops claire in her tracks.

                     claire
          what?

                     norman
          maybe you resent how busy i've been.

                     claire
          what are you...?  no.

                     norman
          you know what i've got at stake with this
          paper.  you know that.  i can't help but
          think that you're doing this now to hurt
          me, or to sabotage me somehow.

                     claire
          sabotage?

                     norman
          ever since the accident i've been
          worried that you'd been unhappy, or...

                     claire
          the accident...?

                     norman
          but then you've been so much better...

                     claire
          norman, this isn't about you.  this is
          something that's happening to me.  it's
          not to get even...and it's not some
          warped bid for attention.  some strange
          things are happening in our house,
          whether you believe in them or not...

                     norman
          sweetheart--

                     claire
          no!  not sweetheart, no.  i believe in
          what's happening.  i don't want to, but i
          do.  i guess i was foolish enough to think
          that would be enough for you.

she turns on a heel and walks toward her car.
