ext.  campus - night

norman catches up to her as a large crowd is filing out of
the concert hall next door.

                     norman
          you're overreacting.

she turns on him.

                     claire
          don't tell me how to react!

norman glances around at the crowded sidewalk.

                     norman
          keep your voice down.

                     claire
          i will not.

some of the bystanders stop to watch.

                     claire
               (still loud)
          maybe you're right.  maybe i'm losing my
          mind...

                     norman
               (looking around)
          claire, please...

claire leans in and lowers her voice without diminishing her
intensity.

                     claire
          ...but what if i'm not?  what if she died
          in terror and betrayal and some part of
          her can't move on while that's
          unresolved.  can't you just...

something behind him catches her eye.  she trails off.

                     claire
          wow...

claire walks past him toward the parking lot.

                     norman
          claire, please...

there's a dangerous energy to her walk.  people step out of
the way.
