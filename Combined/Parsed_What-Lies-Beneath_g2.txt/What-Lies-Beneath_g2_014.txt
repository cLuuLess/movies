ext.  driveway - day

claire walks out to find her best friend, jody, pretty, in
her forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.

                     claire
          hey there.

jody hugs her.

                     jody
          how you holding up?

                     claire
          good.  i'm good.

                     jody
          you are?

                     claire
          why does everyone find that so
          surprising?

                     jody
               (are you kidding?)
          cause...your...only daughter just went
          away to school...who you were incredibly
          close with aaand i'd be tripping...

                     claire
          okay, i'm a little tender.

                     jody
          well good.  so you're human.

                     claire
          and so far my day has consisted of taking
          pictures of my roses for the garden club.

                     jody
          wow.  got here just in time.
               (reaching into her bag)
          i brought you this.

she proffers several homemade tea bags.

                     claire
          what is it?

                     jody
          kambucha mushroom tea...

                     claire

          psychic wellness.  sela suggested i bring--

                     claire
          you're discussing me with your psychic?

                     jody
          she's not a psychic.  just a very
          enlightened spirit.

                     claire
          thanks, but i'm fine.

                     jody
               (pressing it into her hand)
          so you'll have some later.
               (beat)
          notice anything...different?

claire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint
karman-ghia behind her.

                     claire
          oh my god.  you bought it.

                     jody
          yep.

                     claire

                     jody
          beautiful thing, alimony.  lose a husband,
          get a car.  think it'll help me pick up
          dudes?

                     claire
          absolutely.

                     jody
          listen, i've gotta run.  i just thought
          i'd stop by and see if you want to take
          the boat out, say thursday morning?

                     claire
          you got it.

jody grins.

                     jody
          see you then.

jody drives off.  claire walks down the driveway to her front
door and sees mr. feur staring at her from a window.  she
starts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.

claire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the
