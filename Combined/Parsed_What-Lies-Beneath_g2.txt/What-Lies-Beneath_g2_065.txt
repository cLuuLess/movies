int.  powder room - night

claire stands in the spacious powder room, checking her
makeup in the mirror.  mrs. templeton enters from the
bathroom.

                     mrs. templeton
          how're you holding up?

                     claire
          just fine.  it's a lovely party.

the two women fix their makeup side-by-side in the mirror.

                     mrs. templeton
          norman was telling me the dream house is
          finally finished.

                     claire
               (nodding)
          almost.

                     mrs. templeton
          wonderful.  it's good to see you two doing
          so well.

claire looks confused.

                     claire
          i'm sorry?

                     mrs. templeton
          i know how hard it can be sometimes.

claire turns to her.

                     claire
          uh-huh.  what can be?

                     mrs. templeton
          well, i don't think i've seen you since
          the reception at dean ackerman's last
          year.

claire's still in the dark.

                     mrs. templeton
          for the dupont chair.
               (off claire's look)
          i swear.  i'm becoming the nosy old lady i
          used to run from at amherst.

                     claire
          no.  i'm just not sure what you mean.

                     mrs. templeton
          there was just...some tension.  you were
          upset.  i remember being concerned.

                     claire
          at the party.

                     mrs. templeton
          toward the end.  you remember?

                     claire
               (recovering)
          ohhh yes.  no, no.  just a little, you
          know...we're fine.

                     mrs. templeton
          well, i'm glad.  pardon my intrusiveness,
          but we do have to stick together you
          know.

                     claire
          who's that?

                     mrs. templeton
          the wives.

beat.

                     claire
          right.

mrs. templeton leaves.  claire looks into the mirror.

                     claire (v.o.)
          what was it about?
