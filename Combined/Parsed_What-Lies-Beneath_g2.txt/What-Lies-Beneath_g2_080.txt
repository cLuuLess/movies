int.  norman's study - day

norman finds claire seated on his desk, her legs spread.

                     norman
          i take it your not mad at me.

                     claire
          wouldn't go that far.

she grabs his belt and pulls him into her, then holds the
apple to his mouth.  norman tentatively takes a bite.  she
mashes it slowly into his mouth until he recoils slightly.

                     norman
               (mouth full)
          okay...

when he chews the huge bite, a glistening drop of juice runs
down his chin.  claire leans forward and licks it off.

                     norman
          what's gotten into you?

she just smiles mischievously, then starts kissing him.  it
looks like she's eating his lips.  norman's getting hot.  she
bites down on a lip.

                     norman
          ow!

                     claire
          what's the matter?

                     norman
          it's too rough.

                     claire
          since when?

something about this response frightens him.  claire yanks
norman's belt open.  he steps back, tripping over his
castered desk chair.  she's on top of him in a flash, sitting
astride him.  she speaks in a forceful, sexy whisper.

                     norman
          i don't like this, this...

                     claire
               (pinning his hands above his
                head)
          why don't you shut up and fuck me,
          professor.

she grinds up against him.  suddenly, something pulls her eye
to the hallway.

pov - the coat rack mirror, now from inside the study.  in
it's reflection:  another claire, shorter hair, stunned
expression.  where she's standing...it's daytime.

claire leans over him until they're nose-to-nose.

                     claire
               (tense whisper)
          i think she's starting to suspect
          something.

                     norman
               (through clenched teeth)
          who?

                     claire
               (leaning down)
          your wife...

                     norman
          stop it!

norman shoves her off of him onto the floor.  he stands,
breathless.

                     norman
          what the hell are you doing?!

in a moment, it's claire again, stunned and trembling against
the wall.

                     claire
               (to herself, remembering)
          "you know..."

                     norman
               (rattled)
          what?

she looks up.

                     claire
          i was there.

                     norman
          claire--

                     claire
               (flooding back to her)
          i came to work in the garden and i saw
          you with her...in my house.

                     norman
          oh god...

                     claire
          i snuck back to my car, trying to
          convince myself it never happened.  and
          when i woke up in the hospital...somehow
          it hadn't.  until now.

he just stares at her, his face anguished.

                     norman
          it was last year.  we were having
          troubles.

                     claire
          so you fucked a student?!

                     norman
               (reaching for her)
          that's not what i'm sayi--

                     claire
               (pulling back)
          don't touch me.  just get away from me.
          go!

he's frozen.

                     claire
          i said get out!

norman doesn't move.  he's never seen her like this.

                     claire
          fine...

she bolts toward the living room.  he follows her.
