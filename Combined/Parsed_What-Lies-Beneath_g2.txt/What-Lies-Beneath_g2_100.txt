ext.  sailboat - dusk

claire stands toward the bow watching the sunset.  the leaves
on the surrounding hills are stunning.  norman appears beside
her.

                     norman
          last sail of the year.

she gazes out.

                     claire
          the leaves...

                     norman
          incredible.  we should take a drive before
          they're gone.  spend the night at some
          cozy little bed and breakfast.

                     claire
          look for antiques...

                     norman
          yep.  there's some great places nearby.

                     claire
               (a reflex)
          adamant.

                     norman
          what?

                     claire
          little village down seven.  supposed to be
          charming.

                     norman
          huh.

                     claire
          do you know it?

                     norman
          don't think so.

                     claire
          maybe we can stop there for lunch.

he wraps an arm around her.

                     norman
          whatever you'd like.

she leans against him, staring out.
