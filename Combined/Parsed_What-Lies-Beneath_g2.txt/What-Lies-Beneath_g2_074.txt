int.  living room - day

claire sits on a couch in the cramped living room.  mrs.
frank serves up a mug of coffee.  a soap plays silently on an
old 19" rca.

                     mrs. frank
          just plain old coffee.  none of that mocha
          nonsense.

                     claire
          it's fine.

she sizes claire up.

                     mrs. frank
          you look a little old for a student.

                     claire
          i'm not.  we...we met at a party.

                     mrs. frank
          sounds about right.  never understood how
          a girl that wild got all a's.  sure didn't
          get it from me.  they wanted to put her in
          a special school for the gifted when she
          was young.  maddie wouldn't hear about it.

                     claire
          she never mentioned her father.

                     mrs. frank
          well she wouldn't.  he left when she was
          twelve.  never spoke about him after that.

there's a silence.  mrs. frank stares at the tv.

                     mrs. frank
          don't need the sound.  you can pretty much
          tell what's happening by the faces.  turn
          it up sometimes, though.  feels like
          someone's here.

claire doesn't know what to say.  mrs. frank turns to her.

                     mrs. frank
          why are you here?

                     claire
          i don't know.

                     mrs. frank
          it's like that.  doesn't seem real.  no
          note.  nothing.
               (beat)
          cops say she'll be back.  i just wanna
          know what happened.

claire stares at this tough, tragic woman.

                     mrs. frank
          wanna see her room?

claire nods.
