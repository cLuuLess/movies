ext.  feur's back porch - day

she takes in the lake view from the large porch.  the wind is
really blowing.  her eye catches on something.  propped
against the back door...

the soil covered shovel

claire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,
then knocks at the back door.  there's no answer.  she knocks
again.  nothing.  she's turning to go, then the door swings
open.  the smile fades from claire's face.

claire's pov

the immense mr. feur filling the doorway.

                     mr. feur
          yes?

                     claire
          um...

                     mr. feur
          i'm running late here.  i just came back
          for my briefcase.

                     claire
          right.  well, i wanted to stop by to
          welcome you to the uh, to the
          neighborhood.  i'm claire spencer.  from
          next door.

                     mr. feur
          this really isn't a good time.

he starts to close the door.

                     claire
          well maybe your wife...

                     mr. feur
               (growing cold)
          she isn't here.

                     claire
          when...when will she be back?

                     mr. feur
          i don't know.

                     claire
          oh-kay...

                     mr. feur
          i have to go.

slam.  and claire is staring at a closed door.

                     jody (v.o.)
          what do you mean she's gone?
