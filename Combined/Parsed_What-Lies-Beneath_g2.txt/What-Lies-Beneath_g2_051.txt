int.  bathroom - night

still sucking on her finger, claire walks in and begins to
clean up the remains of the seance.  she bends down to pick
up the ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub
is again full to the brink of overflowing.

                     claire
          what do you want?!

claire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.
there is only silence.  she reaches in to pull the plug,
nearly scalding her hand.  when she turns for a hand towel
she finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:

                      "you know"

she draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.
