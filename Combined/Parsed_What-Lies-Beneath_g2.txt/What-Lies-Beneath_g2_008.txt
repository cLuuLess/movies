int.  caitlin's room - day

claire pushes open the door to caitlin's room carrying an
armful of folded laundry.  she moves quickly to the bureau,
not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a tiny
black top from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  she's
just about to close it, when something catches her eye.

claire's pov

she drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old
juilliard t-shirt with a very seventies logo from the drawer.
claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of
caitlin's recently concluded childhood; pictures, trophies,
stuffed animals.

she brings the now faded t-shirt to her face and drinks in
the smells.  she stares down at the word "juilliard."
