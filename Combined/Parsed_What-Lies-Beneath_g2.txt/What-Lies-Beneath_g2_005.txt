ext.  sidewalk cafe - day

claire peruses her "to do" list as caitlin munches a panini.

                     claire
          ...and i still think we should get you
          some mittens.

caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.
the bond between them is palpable.

                     claire
          do you have a scarf?

                     caitlin
          hey.

claire looks up from her little pad of paper.

                     claire
          yes?

                     caitlin
          it's only two hours away.

                     claire
          i know that.

                     caitlin
          i'll come back all the time.

                     claire
          of course you will.

                     caitlin
          i'm just saying, you're going to be
          fine.

claire smiles.

                     claire
          sweetheart, i've known this day was
          coming for a long time.  i've got your
          father and the garden and the new house.
          you really don't have to worry.

caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some
concern.  claire takes her hand.

                     claire
          really.

she nods reassuringly and pulls caitlin into an embrace.  her
eyes close.

                     caitlin (v.o.)
          mother...
