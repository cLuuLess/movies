ext.  jody's studio - day

an old industrial loft filled with finished and half-finished
oil paintings.  jody brings claire some tea.

                     claire
          ...and everything i have, everything i
          thought my life was...christ when i think
          of all the lies...

jody looks down.

                     claire
          what?
               (beat)
          jody what?

jody looks up, tears in her eyes.

                     claire
          oh god...you knew.

                     jody
          i was down in adamant...

                     claire
          adamant?

                     jody
          artsy little village down seven.  there's
          a guy there who sells my work.  i had just
          dropped off some paintings and as i got
          in my car...i saw norman sitting at this
          little cafe.

claire waits for her to continue.

                     jody
          i started to walk over...but he wasn't
          alone.  a blond.  i only caught a glimpse.
          she was young.
               (beat)
          i should have said something right away.
          but i didn't.

                     claire
          why?

                     jody
          partly because i didn't want to hurt
          you...but partly...partly because i was
          relieved.

                     claire
          relieved?

                     jody
          i had just been left by richard.  i was
          bitter and miserable and for some fucked
          up reason, it made me feel better that
          your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.

claire nods.

                     jody
          by the time i finally got up the nerve to
          tell you, stan called from the hospital
          and it was too late.

                     claire
          too late?  jody, it was an accident.

                     jody
          alone?  on a two lane road?  with a ton of
          valium in your system?

claire walks over to a window.

                     jody
          i got there first.  stan covered up the
          pills and i had it out with norman.  he
          seemed desperate not to lose you.  he
          promised to handle it.  and we all let it
          drop away.

                     claire
          all of us.

beat.

                     jody
          i'm a terrible friend.

                     claire
          no.

claire turns.

                     claire
          how could i expect you to tell me
          something that i wouldn't even tell
          myself?

                     jody
          what are you going to do?

                     claire
          i don't know.

                     jody
          if she was dangerous before--

                     claire
          she could have hurt me if she wanted to.

                     jody
          you don't know that.
               (beat)
          if it's your belief that gives her form,
          then you've got to shut her out.  somehow
          you have to break the connection.

                     claire
          no.  she wanted me to know the truth.  now
          that i do...i think she's at peace.

jody isn't as sure.
