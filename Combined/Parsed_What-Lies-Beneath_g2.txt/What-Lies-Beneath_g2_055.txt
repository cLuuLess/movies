int.  dr. drayton's office - day

claire sits back in the chair.  she looks drained.  a soft
rain taps against the windows.

                     claire
          and his face...it seemed so gentle, and i
          knew...in that second i knew that i'd
          imagined the whole thing.

dr. drayton takes this in.  she seems genuinely frightened.

                     claire
          what's happening to me?

                     dr. drayton
          well, that's what we're here for.

he watches her calmly, some empathy on his face.

                     dr. drayton
          whether you imagined it or not, you
          actually saw and heard things that
          frightened you...that gave you reason for
          concern.

                     claire
          yes, but...

                     dr. drayton
          your friend saw them.

                     claire
          isn't there something called group
          hysteria?

                     dr. drayton
          you think you influenced her?

                     claire
          maybe.  i don't know.  i just know that
          when all this was happening, i felt, some
          part of me felt...alive.  like somebody
          needed me.  and the more i reached out to,
          it, the fuller it became.

                     dr. drayton
          you're saying you willed these events to
          happen?

                     claire
          i don't know, i'm very confused right
          now.

beat.

                     dr. drayton
          did you ever find out what it wanted?

claire remembers.

                     claire
          she said, "you know."  that i know.

                     dr. drayton
          do you?

                     claire
          no.

                     dr. drayton
          what do you think?
               (beat)
          guess.

claire ponders this.

                     claire
          i felt...pain.  that she'd been hurt by
          someone.
               (beat)
          this is great.  i'm trying to intuit the
          emotions of a figment of my--

                     dr. drayton
          have you been hurt?

                     claire
          me?  no.  well, in the accident i was
          injured, but...

                     dr. drayton
          you were in an accident?

                     claire
          last year.  i drove my car up a tree.
          nothing serious, this...
               (she indicates her scar)
          ...a minor concussion.  but the car looked
          bad.  it could have been bad.  i think it
          scared the hell out of norman.

beat.

                     dr. drayton
          how's your marriage?

claire's eyes widen.

                     claire
          listen, don't hold back.

dr. drayton smiles kindly.

                     claire
          well, he's been amazing throughout this
          whole thing.  patient and caring...
               (beat)
          i mean, sure, he can be obsessed with his
          work, and...it's a very important time
          right now with all that.  but,
          sometimes...i mean with everybody, right?
          sometimes it's like...

she trails off.

                     dr. drayton
          what?

                     claire
          that he doesn't...see me, or, you know,
          that i'm...that's something's wrong...with
          me.

                     dr. drayton
          that can't feel good.

                     claire
          no, it doesn't...okay, look, i see what
          you're doing here, and that's, i'm sorry,
          but that's not it.  my marriage is fine.
          i've had some kind of "empty-nest"
          episode where i saw some things that
          weren't there.  let's deal with that.  i'm
          willing to deal with that.
               (beat)
          i just don't want to go conjuring
          problems where none exist.

claire finishes her tirade.  dr. drayton lets her settle for
a moment.

                     dr. drayton
          fair enough.  but you should know that i'm
          far less concerned with whether things
          you saw "existed," than i am with why you
          saw them.

she takes in the ramifications of that.
