int.  work room - night

claire stares at the computer screen triumphantly.

                     claire
          see?

                     norman
          what am i looking at?

                     claire
               (indicating completed solitaire
                game)
          i didn't do that.

                     norman
          who did?  mrs. feur?

                     claire
          maybe.  point is...not me.

                     norman
          right.  and why is she here?  if he killed
          her, why doesn't she haunt him?

                     claire
          she was lonely, i talked to her.  norman,
          i know how it looks, but--

                     norman
          claire, listen to me.  i know you're under
          some strain.  but there's no such thing as
          ghosts.  they don't exist.  our neighbor
          did not kill his wife, and i...wait, why
          aren't you dressed?

                     claire
          dressed?

                     norman
          dinner.  with stan and his new girl.

                     claire
          when?

                     norman
          what do you mean?  claire, we talked about
          it.  you didn't want japanese, i said, our
          first date since...

                     claire
               (she seems confused)
          oh.

                     norman
          ...since caitlin.  you don't remember
          this?

                     claire
          tonight?

                     norman
          yes, tonight.  we're going to be--

she looks at his watch.

                     claire
          fashionably five minutes late.

she bolts up the stairs.
