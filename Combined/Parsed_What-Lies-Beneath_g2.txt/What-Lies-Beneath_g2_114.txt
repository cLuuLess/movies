int.  foyer - night

she fumbles for some keys in a basket by the door, then looks
at the cell phone's recharging cradle.  it's empty.

she spots norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles
through the pockets.  she finds the phone, and flips it open
to see if it's working.  a drop of something splats on the
phone.  then another.  it's blood.

she looks up and sees norman, his forehead gashed, glaring
down from the landing.

she reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in
her hand make it difficult to open.  norman hurls himself
over the banister.  thud!

a bloody hand yanks her backwards.  claire slams into the
corner by the armoir.  norman advances on her.  at the last
moment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles
over on norman.
