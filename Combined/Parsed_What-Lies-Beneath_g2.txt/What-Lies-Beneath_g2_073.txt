ext.  porch - day

claire rings the bell.  a drawn looking woman in her early
fifties answers the door.

                     claire
          mrs. frank?

                     mrs. frank
          yeah.

                     claire
          i'd like to talk to you about madison.

                     mrs. frank
          you know where she is?

                     claire
          no, i don't.

                     mrs. frank
          please leave me alone.

she starts to close the door.  claire leans forward.

                     claire
          she's my friend.

the woman stops.

                     claire
          was.  we were...acquainted.  i've been
          away for awhile.  when i came back...

she studies claire.

                     mrs. frank
          what's your name?

                     claire
          claire.

                     mrs. frank
          she never mentioned you.

claire doesn't know what to say to this.

                     mrs. frank
          then again, she didn't say much about her
          college friends.

she gives claire the once over.

                     mrs. frank
          i'm watchin' my shows.

she motions claire in.
