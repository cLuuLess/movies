int.  pickup - night

angle

claire through the windshield.  her face striped by the
reflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across
the windshield.  she flips open the cell phone and punches in
911.  it blinks:  "no service."

                     claire
          shit.

she glances into the rear view mirror.

claire's pov

a stern section of the boat's covering tarp untied, flapping
in the breeze.

claire desperately punches the "talk" button again..."no
service."  she's past the center of the bridge.  she looks
again:  "roam."  claire punches the talk button again.

smash!

a trailer crank punches through the window.  norman's arm
follows, coiling like a python around claire's neck, his grim
visage pressed against the glass.

she squashes down the accelerator.
