she's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to
falter.  she tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters

claire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.
norman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the
halothane to take its full effect.  finally, she freezes.
norman picks up the phone and stands over her.

                     norman

he picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her
slowly up the stairs.

                     norman
          the ghost stuff, that was impressive.

          i figure you saw her that day in the

          masterpiece.
