int.  norman's study - night

norman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit
room.  he pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting
closed on his desk.  he looks around, sees the room is empty
and walks over to it.

the mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is
engraved:  to n.c.s. with love always, m.e.f.

he pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside.

the lights switch on.

claire stands in the doorway, holding out the silver rosebud
necklace.

                     claire
          looking for this?

norman stares at her dumbly.

                     claire
          she's out there isn't she?  she's in the
          lake.

                     norman
          okay.  don't...you don't understand what
          this is.

                     claire
          don't i, norman?  you kept the fucking
          necklace.  of a woman you killed!

                     norman
               (nearly hysterical)
          i did not!  i did not kill anyone.  jesus.
          claire, listen to me.  i walked in and she
          was lying there dead.  i swear to you.  on
          my life!  she took pills and she killed
          herself in our house to destroy me!  to
          destroy us!  if i hadn't stopped by here
          before school, the painters would have--

                     claire
          i don't believe you.

                     norman
          it's true.  that's...you have to believe
          me!  oh god, i'm telling you the truth!
               (beat, fighting tears)
          i did what i had to, claire.  she was
          gone.  there was nothing i could do for
          her.  i did...i put her in the lake.  i
          rolled the car in...and i watched it sink.
               (beat)
          and i've lived with that image ever since.
               (beat)
          i couldn't just stand there while
          everything-- my career, us,
          everything, just washed away.  don't you
          see, claire?  she's doing this!  this is
          exactly what she wants you to think!

claire's lip is quivering with confusion.

                     claire
          i don't know what's true anymore.
               (beat)
          but that girl must be brought up.  now do
          you want to call the police?  or should i?

norman stares at the phone.  he's a wreck.

                     norman
          fine.  i can't live with it anymore.

he takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits.

                     norman
          this is dr. norman spencer.  no, it's not
          an emergency.

he looks at claire.

                     norman
          i have some information about a missing
          girl, madison frank...yes.  could you send
          an officer?  fifteen willoughby, about a
          mile before the bridge...thank you.

he hangs up.  long silence.  they look at each other.

                     norman
          you did the right thing.
               (beat)
          i'm going to get cleaned up.

he walks out.  claire walks over and stands before the box.
