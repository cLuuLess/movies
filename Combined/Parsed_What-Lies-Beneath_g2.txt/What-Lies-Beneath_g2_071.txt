int.  norman's study - night

norman is unpacking notes and chemicals from his leather bag.
claire walks in.

                     claire
          remember this?

she places the printout on his desk.  he takes a long look at
it.

                     norman
          is this that girl from last year?

claire nods.

                     claire
          did you know her?

norman looks again.

                     norman
          i may have seen her on campus.

                     claire
          not personally.

                     norman
          no.
               (beat)
          i'm afraid to ask what this is about.

                     claire
               (solemnly)
          it's her.  this is the woman who i've
          seen.

                     norman
          the...

                     claire
          yes.  the ghost.

norman leaves the hung frame and walks over to a window.

                     claire
          i thought it was mrs. feur, but it's
          not...

                     norman
               (quietly overlapping)
          stop...

                     claire
          ...i'm positive this time...

                     norman
               (overlapping)
          ...please stop...

                     claire
          it's madison fra--

                     norman
          stop it!

claire falls silent, norman turns from the window.

                     norman
               (calmly)
          claire, i've tried to be there.  i know
          you're going through something that i
          can't understand...but it's enough.

claire looks down.

                     norman
          do you want to go see someone?  together?
          should we call dr. drayton?

she shakes her head.

                     norman
          well then what?  claire, what?  tell me
          what i can do.

long pause.  claire looks up, then timidly holds out the
printout.

                     claire
          it's her.

norman's jaw tightens.

                     claire
          i don't want to make you angry.  but she's
          here.  and i don't know why...

he silently walks out of the room.  claire stares down at the
face in the photo.
