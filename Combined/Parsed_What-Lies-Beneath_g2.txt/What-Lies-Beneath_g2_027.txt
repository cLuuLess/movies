int.  bedroom - night

norman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes.

                     norman
          i'm gonna have the police check on the
          house.

claire leans against the window sill.

                     claire
          oh great, "can you look in on my wife,
          she's hearing voices?"  wait'll that gets
          around.

he walks over to her.

                     norman
          i've got the conference next week.  i want
          you to feel safe.

                     claire
          i do, i do.  i'm sure i'm just...how
          was your day?

he goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box
in his dresser.

                     norman
          think i may have cracked it.

                     claire
          really?

she produces a match and lights it.  they sit on the bed.

                     norman
          i think so.  maybe.

                     claire
          you are so brilliant.

                     norman
          yep.

                     claire
          madame curie, jonas salk, norman
          spencer...

                     norman
               (smiling)
          you know what that does to me.

she takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck.

                     norman
               (stopping)
          ohmigod.  you'll never believe...i saw
          schumway...

                     claire
          you're kidding.

                     norman
          he's here giving some arcane spiel for
          the physics department, so bob shine
          introduces us...

                     claire
          wow.

he nods, claire passes the joint back.

                     norman
          and he says...you'll fucking love this,
          he says, "doctor spencer, i am a great
          admirer of your work..."

                     claire
          well, that's nice.

                     norman
          "...especially spencer's theorem..."

                     claire
               (overlapping)
          oh, no...

                     norman
          "...of perpetual distances."
               (beat)
          everybody's checking their shoelaces.
          pins drop.  "i'm afraid you've mistaken
          me,"  i say...

                     claire
               (overlapping)
          that's...

                     norman
          "...for my father."

                     claire
          i'm so sorry.

                     norman
          didn't know he was dead, every stinking
          paper on the globe.

                     claire
          that's just mean.
               (indicating joint)
          oh.  jody wanted to know if i could get
          her some.

                     norman
               (quickly glancing over)
          did you tell her?

                     claire
          what?  no.  no.

                     norman
          you didn't?

                     claire
               (with a smile)
          norman, you are so funny about that.  no,
          i didn't.

he takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.

                     norman (o.s.)
          cause that would be really--

she lays back on the bed.  sounds of flushing.

                     claire
          i didn't.

he reappears without the joint.

                     norman
          sorry.  you understand.

                     claire
          did you call about the feurs?

                     norman
          oh, right.  yes.  harvey says the guy's a
          sweetheart.  wouldn't hurt a fly.

                     claire
          huh.

claire ponders this.  norman turns off the light and joins
her on the bed.  he kisses her knee.

                     norman
          do the brilliant norman stuff some more.

then starts working his way up her thigh.

                     norman
          and speak up.

claire smiles.
