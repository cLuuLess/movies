ext.  lake - day

claire and jody knife slowly through the water in the
spencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the old
lighthouse, the bride in the background.

                     claire
          she's not there.  i haven't seen her since
          that morning.  well, i mean, i've never
          actually seen her, but i'm telling you,
          she's disappeared.

jody finishes securing a line.  the breeze is mild, so they
just cruise with the wind.

                     jody
          what are you saying?

claire just looks at her.

                     jody
          you think he killed her?

                     claire
          i don't know.  when you say it, it sounds
          crazy.  but what else could it all be?

jody shakes her head.

                     claire
          i mean, he's so kind of grim and
          daunting, and she sounded terrified of
          something.

claire glances over at jody.

                     claire
               (laughing to herself)
          listen to me.  i sound like some middle-
          aged nancy drew.

jody regards her.  after a beat:

                     jody
          know what i think?

                     claire
          what?

                     jody
          seance.

                     claire
          jody, no...

                     jody
          telling you...

                     claire
               (overlapping)
          ...no...no...no...

                     jody
          just bought this beautiful antique ouija.

                     claire
          please.  that's all i need.

jody shrugs, "have it your way."  beat.

                     jody
          hey, look.

claire's house across the lake.

                     jody
          so pretty.

claire's pov

a figure in the turreted window of norman's study.

                     claire
          someone's there.

                     jody
          what?

                     claire
          in the window.  norman's at work.

                     jody
          i don't...

claire looks over at jody.

                     claire
               (pointing)
          there.  in the study.  don't you see--

she looks again-- nothing.

                     claire
          wow.  i'm losing it.

                     jody
          no, you're not.
               (beat)
          but a presence in your house is not
          something to be taken lightly.

claire stares back at the house.
