int.  norman's study - night

the picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  she
drops to her knees over the picture.  this time the glass is
shattered.  when she picks out the remaining shards, the
newspaper photo slides out.  claire glances at the benign
news stories on the back.

she looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack
in the floor boards by the knot.

claire's pov

the piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like a copper
coin in the crack.  it's too big to be a penny.

she tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but
recoils.  a tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which
she pops into her mouth.
