int.  norman and claire's room - night

norman snores softly.  claire is awakened by the continuing
storm.  she pads out to norman's turreted library.  rain
pelts the glass.  her face is briefly illuminated by the
lighthouse beam.

she hears the sound of a door closing and moves to get a
better view of the feur's.  nothing but blackness.  just as
she's turning to go back to bed.  a lightning flash lights up
the night.  claire's eyes go wide.

claire's pov

in the split second of brilliance, she sees mr. feur, in
shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging a large duffel toward the
open trunk of his car.

                     claire
               (in a hoarse whisper)
          norman!

he's dead to the world.  she calls to him again.

                     claire
          norman, you have to look at this!

                     norman
          mmnph.

                     claire
          hurry...

another flash illuminates...norman at her side.

                     claire
          look!

...an empty driveway, then blackness.

                     norman
          what is it?  what's the matter?

she stares down into the darkness.

                     claire
          nothing.  there was...i thought i saw
          something.

                     norman
          is it gone?

the beacon illuminates the empty driveway.  she nods.

                     norman
          come on, let's go back to bed.

yet another bolt of lightning reveals claire, still at the
window.
