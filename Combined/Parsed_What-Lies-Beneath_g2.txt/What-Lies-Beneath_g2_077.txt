int.  bathroom - night

claire shuts the blinds, then places the large candle on the
floor, then places the missing girl printout at the base of
the candle.  on top if it, she places the braid.

then claire lights the candle, puts the braid on the picture,
and hunches over it, whispering intensely:

                     claire
          i need to know the truth.

she waits a beat.  nothing.

                     claire
          madison, please...help me.

nothing happens.  she looks around at the seance props.

she stands and places her hands on the sink.  she glances at
herself in the mirror.

                     claire
          what am i doing?

suddenly, her head droops over, she shudders softly.  when
she looks back into the mirror, her eyes are a deep green.
she hears the front door open downstairs.

                     norman (o.s.)
          hello...anybody home?!

a strange smile creeps across her face.
