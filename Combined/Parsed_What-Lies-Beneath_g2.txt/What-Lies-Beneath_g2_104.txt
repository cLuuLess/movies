ext.  shop - day

claire stands in front of the store window.  a sign in the
window identifies it as "the sleeping dog - hand wrought
jewelry and gifts."  claire tries to open the door, but sees
a closed sign.

she steps back out to the window and looks in.  on display
are a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.

suddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an
intricate rosebud.

her eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display
where she spots, a small ornate copper chest.  protruding
from its lock...the interlocked circles.  claire looks like
she's been punched.
