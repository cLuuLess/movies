ext.  patio - night

claire stands at a small bar.

                     claire
               (to bartender)
          white wine please.

she scans the party and spots the feurs deep in some intimate
conversation with each other.  she's speaking about something
astonishing.  he's rapt.

claire locates norman in a corner listening as some aged
alumnus holds forth.  he sees her and mouths, "i'm sorry."
he points to his watch and flashes five fingers.  she smiles
and nods.

                     voice (o.s.)
          guess i'm not much of a medium.

she turns to see jody.

                     claire
          jody...

they hug.

                     jody
          are you okay?

                     claire
          i think so

                     jody
          i'm sorry for leaving, but i mean, jesus,
          claire...

                     claire
          it's alright.

                     jody
          i mess around with this stuff, but i
          never thought anything would happen.

claire looks uncomfortable.

                     jody
          does norman know?

                     claire
          jody, she's alive.

                     jody
          what?

                     claire
          mrs. feur.  she's alive.  i met her.
          she's really sweet.

                     jody
          then what was it?

                     claire
          nothing.  it wasn't anything.  i've been
          on edge lately.  maybe since the accident.
          and i'd prefer, i really would, to just--

                     jody
          something was there.  you saw it.

                     claire
          did i?

                     jody
          yes.  now i talked to sela and there's a
          guy, this pakistani guy down in
          hartford...

                     claire
          hartford?

                     jody
          and he's the real thing.  specializes in
          cases like this, like yours.

                     claire
          no.  jody, listen to me.  you have to
          listen to me.  this is not something that
          i can do right now.  whatever it was,
          it's gone.  i need it to be gone now.

                     jody
          but claire--

                     claire
          please.

jody recognizes her fragility.

                     jody
          okay.  okay.

                     claire
          i've got to find a bathroom.  i'll call
          you.

jody nods as claire walks off.
