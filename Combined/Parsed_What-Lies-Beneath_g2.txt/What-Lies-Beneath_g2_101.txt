ext.  driveway - day

jody and claire return from a walk.  norman has the boat on
the trailer and is securing a tarp over it.  they stop under
a tree.

                     claire
          but he acted like he'd never heard of it.

                     jody
          did he say that?

                     claire
          jody he was lying.

                     jody
          what if he was?  do you think he wanted to
          bring that up again just when you're
          trying to make a new start?

                     claire
          i guess not.

                     jody
          he's trying to put it behind him, claire.
          you should too.

norman smiles and waves.  they wave back as they arrive at
the karman-ghia.

                     jody
          you've got a beautiful life.  and even
          with this, it's always been clear that he
          loves you.
               (beat)
          i've come to think that's all that really
          matters.

                     claire
          i don't know...

                     jody
          trust me, claire.  you hear something...
          change the subject.  you find something...
          get rid of it, throw it in the lake.
               (beat)
          you know what happened.  the rest is only
          details.  and no one's ever glad they got
          a hold of those.  if you want to put this
          back together...just let it go.

jody drives off.  claire walks over to norman.  she hugs him
tightly.

                     norman
          what's that for?

                     claire
          nothing.

                     norman
          i'm cooking you dinner.

                     claire
          you don't have to do that.

                     norman
          i know.

                     claire
          fine.  i'll do the shopping.

they kiss.  she heads to the volvo.
