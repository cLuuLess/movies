ext.  dock - day

claire's staring down at the printout.  she's kneeling at the
edge of the dock.  from her pocket she produces the blond
braid and a piece of twine.  she wraps the braid up in the
printout with a rock and secures it with the twine.

                     claire
          sorry.  better or worse, he's mine.

she tosses the little parcel into the dark water.  bubbles
stream up.  in the bubbles, claire sees...the pale shape,
which slowly becomes the drowned girl, staring up from
beneath the dark water.

claire wants to pull away, but she's transfixed.  madison
reaches up toward the surface.  as the bubble diminish, she
seems to be fading away.  when she's gone, claire reaches out
toward the water.  when her finger touches the surface...

whoosh!  she's sucked down into the water.
