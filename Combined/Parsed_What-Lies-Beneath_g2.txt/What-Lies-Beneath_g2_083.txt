int.  living room - morning

norman, rumpled and unshaven, is passed out on the couch, a
half empty whiskey bottle beside him on the coffee table.  he
awakens to find claire sitting across from him.

                     claire
          i want you to answer one question.

he waits.

                     claire
          did you have anything to do with her
          disappearance?

beat.

                     norman
          yes.

claire goes pale.

                     norman
          she was damaged and unstable.  the more i
          tried to distance myself, the more
          desperate she became.  finally, she showed
          up at the new house...

                     claire
          how did she know where it was?

he stares off.  the reality sinks in for claire.

                     claire
               (softly)
          our dream house.

norman can hardly look at her.

                     norman
          she was out of control.  she said she was
          going to kill herself...or you.  i never
          thought she'd go through with any of it,
          but then she was gone...

he trails off.

                     claire
          she did it.

                     norman
          we don't know that for sure.

                     claire
          of course she did, norman.  what else
          could it be?

the enormity of this hits norman.  his head drops into his
hands.

                     norman
          oh god, what have i done?  how could i
          have let this into our lives?

he looks up at her, teary.

                     claire
          i don't know.

she gets up and walks out of the room.
