int.  cbgb's - night

claire moves past a huge, black skinhead doorman into an
entrance area in the dark throbbing punk club.  she looks out
over the mob of seething young people, swaying to a pulsing
power-pop band.  punks and club kids push past her as they
move into the throng.  she looks up and her face changes.

claire's pov

a shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a
jangly, but surprisingly melodic song.  her eyes race across
the faces of a butch female drummer, an emaciated
guitarist/singer and stop on the bass player...caitlin.  she
rocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, eyes
closed, swaying to the music.

claire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.
the song ends and caitlin's eyes open.  she smiles for a
moment, then the smile fades as she spots claire.  panicked,
claire ducks behind a pillar.
