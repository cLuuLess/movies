int.  dorm hallway - night

claire walks past a number of doors.  music booms out of one,
shards of a conversation out of another.  finally, she
arrives at a door that says "fur is murder."  she smiles to
herself and knocks.  there's no answer.

                     different voice (o.s.)
          she's out.

claire turns to find an attractive young man standing at her
elbow.

                     young man
          they're playing at cbgb's down on bowery.
          probably won't be back for awhile.  you
          her mom?

                     claire
          yes.  who was playing?

                     young man
          bitch.  caitlin's band.

                     claire
               (stunned)
          caitlin's band?

                     young man
          yeah.  they're really good.  i would have
          gone, but i have a paper.
               (beat)
          and i'm not just saying that because
          you're a mother.

claire nods slightly.

                     claire
          thank you.

she walks down the hall.
