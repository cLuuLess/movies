ext.  adamant - day

claire stands on a street in the quaint little village.  she
looks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.  a
friendly old hippie woman walks out of a store.  she watches
claire gazing around.

                     hippie woman
          what are you looking for?

                     claire
          i don't really know.

                     hippie woman
          know what you mean.

she ambles off across the street.  claire watches her go.
then notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  three
interlocked circles.  she walks toward it.
