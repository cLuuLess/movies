int.  kitchen - night

claire walks in and sets down some packages.  she opens one
and pulls out new toothpaste and...an envelope-- the kind
your pictures come back in.  she absently leafs through them,
then freezes.  she gapes at one of the shots.

                     claire
          oh boy...
