int.  bedroom - day

claire sits on the bed.  norman dabs the blood from a tiny
cut on the back of her head.

                     claire
          i don't need a shrink.

                     norman
               (gently)
          harvey says he's amazing.

                     claire
          norman...

                     norman
          what can it hurt to talk to someone?

she goes to her dresser and gets a prescription bottle and
starts to open it.  norman gently places a hand on her arm.

                     norman
          please.

she shoots him a look...

                     norman
          you promised.

...and puts the pills down.

                     norman
               (gently)
          claire, she's been a huge part of your
          life for seventeen years.  if you weren't
          thrown off balance by this, then
          something would be wrong.

                     claire
          i never said i wasn't upset.  of course
          i'm upset.  i miss her terribly.  but i
          know what i saw and what i heard...and it
          wasn't some "symptom" of something...

                     norman
          i never said...

                     claire
          ...and i don't think i'm some lonely,
          middle-aged woman cracking up.

beat.

                     norman
          are you lonely?

                     claire
          no!  and i don't need a psychiatrist!
