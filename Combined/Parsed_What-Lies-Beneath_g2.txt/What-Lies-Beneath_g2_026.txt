int.  norman's study - night

it's undisturbed.  norman checks the window locks.

                     claire
          it was there.  this angry music all by
          itself.  and i heard whispering.

                     norman
          what kind of whispering?

                     claire
          i don't know.  just...whispering.

he nods as cooper appears.

                     norman
          what'd you see, coop?

the dog stares blankly.

                     claire
               (to cooper)
          tell him!

norman smiles.
