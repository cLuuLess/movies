int.  volvo - night

claire pulls up in front of a large new york hotel.

                     norman
               (on a cell phone)
          ...i'm pulling up, yuri.  i'll see you for
          dinner.
               (to claire)
          sure you won't stay?

                     claire
          no, it's fine.  i'm fine.

                     norman
               (tempting her)
          really big bed.

she smiles and shakes her head.  norman kisses her goodbye,
then grabs his bag from the backseat.

                     norman
          do i have everything?

                     claire
          yep.

                     norman
          call ya later.

he starts to walk into the hotel.

                     claire (o.s.)
          and you glad you married me?

he turns.  she's standing next to the car.

                     norman
          what?

                     claire
          are you glad?  i'm glad.

norman walks over to her and cradles her chin with his hand.

                     norman
               (softly)
          you know i am.

                     claire
          good.
               (she gazes at him, then
                softly)
          you sat in front...i saw you there...

norman takes his cue.

                     norman
          you were lost in the music...eyes
          closed...your chest heaving...

                     claire
          i felt you...looking through me...

                     norman
          we walked all night...

                     claire
          you told me that i was...

he gently cups her chin in his hand.

                     norman
               (overlapping)
          ...that you were everything i'd ever
          dreamed of.

she smiles, kisses him warmly, then gets in the car.
