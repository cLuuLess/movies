int.  claire's kitchen - night

she leads norman in.

                     norman
               (still whispering)
          why am i...
               (full voice)
          why am i whispering in my own house?

claire turns.

                     claire
          he killed her.

                     norman
          what?

                     claire
          he did.  she's in the picture.  i went
          over to look and she's gone.  the table
          was set for one.

                     norman
          and that means he murdered his wife?
          this is getting ridic--

                     claire
          no, no, no, no.  the soil on the shovel,
          his shovel...that's clay.  it's not from
          here, believe me, i...
               (frustrated, she grabs the
                photos)
          all right, look at this.

she triumphantly thrusts one before him.  norman looks at it.

                     norman
          our house.

                     claire
          no.  look!  in the window.

the roses.  she points out a hazy figure in the turreted
window of the study.  norman takes it over to the light.

                     norman
          it's a flare.

                     claire
          a flare?

                     norman
          from the sun.  it's a reflection on the
          glass.

                     claire
          it's her!  i'm telling you.  she whispered
          and turned on the music.  she's trying to
          contact me!

                     norman
               (making sure he's got it)
          it's a ghost.

norman shakes his head.  he looks again at the picture, does
a quick calculation.

                     norman
          you took this in the morning, didn't you?

she nods slightly.

                     norman
          when the sun would be exactly right.

she's got him.

                     claire
          then why isn't it in any of the other
          pictures?

she thrusts the batch at him.  he peruses the other few shots
of the garden.

                     norman
          a cloud passed.  or it's a bounce off the
          lake.  see?

she looks.  he might not be wrong.

                     claire
          where is she then?

                     norman
          she could be out.  she could be sick in
          bed for all we know.

                     claire
          okay.  okay.  i'll bet there's...look at
          this.

she leads him out of the room.
