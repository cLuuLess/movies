int.  norman's study - day

claire places the roses in a vase on norman's desk, and in
doing so, accidentally knocks it over.

with a towel she mops up the water which has dripped onto the
wooden floor.  the stream has flowed over to the knot and
dripped into the crack.  claire stares down at the strange
copper coin.

she grabs a letter opener from norman's desk and pries the
coin out.  it's actually a small brass key, the head of which
is three interlocking circles.  she stares at it for a
moment, then places it in her pocket.
