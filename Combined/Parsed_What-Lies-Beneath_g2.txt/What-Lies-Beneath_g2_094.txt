ext.  dock - day

norman helps claire, coughing, onto the dock.  they hold each
other.

                     norman
          are you okay?

she nods, catching her breath.

                     norman
          we have to get out of here.

                     claire
          it's alright.

                     norman
          can't you see, she's trying to kill us.

                     claire
          she's gone.

                     norman
          what?

                     claire
          she can't be here without me.

                     norman
          how can you be sure?

                     claire
          i don't know, but i am.  she was there and
          then she was gone.  i felt it.

                     norman
          claire...

she stares into the still water.

                     claire
          it's over.
