int.  bathroom - night

claire walks in carrying a half-empty bottle of wine.  she
looks over at jody, who turns off the lights.  jody then
strikes a match and lights a large candle.  she unveils her
carved antique ouija board.

                     jody
          sit down here.

                     claire
               (nervous, jokey)
          are we hoping the ghost is going to
          have to pee?

jody turns to her, deadly serious.

                     jody
          isn't this where you saw her?

claire's smile fades.  she nods.

                     jody
          then this is where she'll be.

they sit cross legged, the board between them.

                     jody
          place your fingers on the planchette.

                     claire
          the planchette?

                     jody
          this.

jody indicates the wooden pointing device.  each woman grasps
an edge.

                     jody
               (in a low voice)
          we wish to commune with the spirit of
          mrs. feur.
               (to claire)
          what's her first name?

                     claire
          i don't know.

jody closes her eyes.  claire follows suit.

                     jody
          i call forth the entity that is haunting
          this house.

they look down at the planchette, which hasn't moved.

                     jody
          mrs. feur?

there's still no movement.

                     claire
          nothing's happening.

                     jody
          shhh.

jody focuses intently.
                     jody
          reveal yourself to us.

a long moment passes.  it's starting to seem like a bust.
suddenly, the candle flares.  even jody seems startled.

                     jody
               (to the spirit)
          who...who are you?

at first, nothing happens.  then, slowly, the planchette
starts to move across the board.

                     claire
          are you doing that?

jody shakes her head.

                     claire
          i'm not doing that.

the planchette comes to rest on the letter "m."  moments
later, it starts to move again drifting over and stopping on
"e."

                     claire
          oh...

                     jody
          m-e...

it starts to drift again, moving slowly toward the space
between "e" and "f."  the planchette stops on "f."  jody
removes her fingers from the device.

                     jody
          mef?  what's mef?

                     claire
          it's initials.  f is feur.  it's her.

suddenly, the candle starts flickering strangely and the
planchette slides jerkily on its own...m-e-f, m-e-f...

                     jody
          shit...

jody stumbles backwards, gasping.

                     jody
          did you see that?

claire leans in.

                     claire
               (to ghost)
          what happened to you?

the candle goes out.

                     jody
          oh god...

jody bolts.  claire follows.
