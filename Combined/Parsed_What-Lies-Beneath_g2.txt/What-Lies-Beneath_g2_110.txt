int.  bedroom - night

claire walks into the bedroom.  the shower can be heard
through the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  steam
drifts out through the crack.

she stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her
weary, distraught countenance in the mirror.  she glances
down.

claire's pov

the necklace still in her hand.

she looks up again into the mirror.  her face goes strangely
blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto
her neck.

suddenly, she stares over at the cordless phone lying on the
bed for a long moment.  she walks over, picks up the phone
and looks at it.

claire's pov

the redial button.

she stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button.  two
rings, then:

                     voice
               (on phone)
          directory assistance...

claire's eyes widen in terror.  she clicks off the phone,
and, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the
hall.  she keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom.  she
quietly pulls open the hallway door.

suddenly, a hand with a washcloth is thrust over her face.

claire shoves norman's hand away and runs past him down the
hall.
