int.  living room - night

she grabs her coat.

                     norman
               (welling up)
          claire, please don't...

                     claire
          what did you think i would do?  jesus
          christ!  i gave up my life and my music...

                     norman
          i never asked you to quit!

                     claire
          ...oh bullshit.  you had to topple perfect
          daddy and that meant perfect wife,
          perfect family...

he follows her as she searches for her purse and keys.

                     norman
          that's not true!  you wanted to quit!  and
          then when you did, you hated me for it...
          so you gave it all to her.

                     claire
          who?

                     norman
          to caitlin!!

she wheels on him with fury.

                     claire
          leave her out of this!

                     norman
          and then out of nowhere, some bright
          young woman found me attractive...

                     claire
          stop...

                     norman
          ...would do anything just to be around
          me.  and i slipped.  god help me, i
          slipped.

                     claire
          i'm not going to listen to this.

claire goes to leave, norman blocks her path.

                     norman
          i tried to break it off!

                     claire
          you should have tried harder.

                     norman
          claire...

                     claire
               (seething)
          get out of my way.

she brushes past him.
