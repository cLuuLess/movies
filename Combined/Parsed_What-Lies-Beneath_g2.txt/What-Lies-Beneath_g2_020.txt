int.  living room - night

she dials a number.  loud reggae can be heard blaring through
the phone.

                     claire
               (straining to be heard)
          hello?  i'm looking for caitlin spencer.
          she's in 314...well, could you check?

she plugs one ear.

                     claire
          oh.  well, just tell her that her mother
          called.  her mother.  thank you.  excuse
          me, how can you study with that?

the noise abruptly stops.  claire clicks off the phone and
replaces it in the sweater pocket.  she tunes the stereo to a
classical music station.
