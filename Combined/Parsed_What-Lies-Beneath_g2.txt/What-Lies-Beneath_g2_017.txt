ext.  lake - day

claire and cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at
the water's edge.  claire tosses a long stick for cooper, who
bolts out onto the long wooden dock.  claire gazes at the
lighthouse across the lake and a long bridge in the distance.
cooper starts barking and looking down into the water.

claire arrives at cooper's side and stares down into the dark
water.

                     claire
          cooper...what do you see?

she looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.
after a moment, she notices a faint white shape directly in
the reflection of her face.  cooper rumbles a low growl.  the
shape seems to be gaining definition.

rrring!

claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her
sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.

                     claire
               (into phone)
          hi.

                     norman (v.o.)
               (on the other end)
          i'm stuck here for another couple of
          hours.

claire's smile fades.

                     claire
          oh.

                     norman (v.o.)
          unless you need me to come home...

                     claire
          no, no.  it's fine.

claire slowly leans out over the water to check her
reflection...

                     norman (v.o.)
          you sure?

...but the shape is gone.

                     norman (v.o.)
          claire?

                     claire
          huh?  absolutely.  take your time.

she clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.
