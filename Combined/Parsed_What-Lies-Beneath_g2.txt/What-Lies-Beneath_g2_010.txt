ext.  front yard - day

her face streaked with tears, claire stumbles out into the
immaculately manicured rose garden.

the yard is surrounded by a high wooden fence.  she collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  suddenly,
she hears something coming from next door.

she cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  it
is, ironically, the sound of a woman crying.  claire makes
her way over to the fence.  the women's sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered.

she places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack.  all she can make out is
a dark blue blur that seems to be rocking.  claire gathers
her nerve and calls out...

                     claire
          hello...

there's no reaction.

                     claire
          mrs. feur?

the sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  the blue
shape vanishes from view.

                     claire
          wait a minute.  i just want--

something bumps against the fence.  claire draws back.  she
hears heavy breathing.

                     mrs. feur
               (sniffling)
          who are you?

                     claire
          it's mrs...it's claire...spencer.  from
          next door.  is everything--

                     mrs. feur
          you're the flower lady.

                     claire
          um...yes.

                     mrs. feur
          i've seen you.  from the window.

                     claire
          is everything alright?

claire leans closer to the tiny crack.  she sees a fleshy
blur and what might be part of an eye.  there's no response,
just the breathing.

                     claire
          hello?

                     mrs. feur
          i'm not...

she seems on the verge of losing it again.

                     mrs. feur
          he's so...it's too much...and i can't...i
          can't breath...

                     claire
          who?  your husband?

                     mrs. feur
          and i'm afraid.  oh god, i'm so afraid
          of...

she trails off.

                     claire
          what?  what are you afraid of?

                     mrs. feur
          i can't, no, no, i can't...

claire edges closer to the crack.

                     claire
          tell me.  please.

                     mrs. feur
          that i'll just...that one day i'll
          just...disappear.

beat.  claire's taken aback by this admission.

                     claire
          tell me.  i can help you.

                     mrs. feur
          how?  how can you help me?  with your
          flowers and your perfect life...

                     claire
          that's not...it's not like that.

                     mrs. feur
          i've never even met you.

                     claire
          i know.  and i'm sorry.  i've been consumed
          with...my daughter left...for school.

                     mrs. feur
          this fence...it's so...

                     claire
          i'm sorry.  it's for the flowers.  why
          don't you...

tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into
the feur's driveway.

                     mrs. feur
          oh god.  he's back.  i'm sorry.  please
          forget that i...i don't know what i'm
          saying.  please...

                     claire
          wait!  don't go...

claire listens to the sound of naked footsteps, followed by a
large front door swinging shut.  a car door swings open and a
man's shoes follow down the path.

claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence
as the door closes a second time.  she sits there for a
moment listening, but all is quiet.

                     claire (v.o.)
          she sounded terrified.
