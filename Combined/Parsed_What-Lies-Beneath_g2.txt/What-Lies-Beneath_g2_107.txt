ext.  dock - night

claire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the
dock.  an expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.
she stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.

she holds out a fist.  her fingers unfold and in her palm
lies the key.  she holds the key out over the water and
stands there, frozen.  the lighthouse beam sweeps past her
once...then again.

claire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,
then carefully places it on the dock.  she very deliberately
takes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the
dock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps
off the dock.
