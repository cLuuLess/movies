int.  living room - afternoon

claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in
position.  after an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow
to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.

claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a
beautiful and melancholy piece of music.  she's very, very
good.  eyes closed.  her body begins to sway slightly as her
left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.

she reaches a difficult transition and falters.  she seems
almost surprised.  she attacks the transition again, and
again falters.  claire bites her lower lip and tries yet
again, this time failing completely.

she sits back in the chair, despondent.  almost as an
afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  at the
end of the tone, something catches her ear.  she can just
make out the hint of a faint feminine voice echoing the tone.

she sits up and plays a different note, then another.  each
time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  finally
she plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  the voice echoes
with a distinct, unsettling shriek.

crash!
