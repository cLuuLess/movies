ext.  porch - day

mrs. frank walks claire out.

                     mrs. frank
          y'hear anything you'll let me know?

                     claire
          of course.

claire walks to her car.  she turns and calls out:

                     claire
          what was her major?

                     mrs. frank
          biology.  she wanted to be a doctor.

claire stands, frozen, as mrs. frank disappears into the
little house.
