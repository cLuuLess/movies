ext.  parking lot - night

claire walks past several cars until she sees the one she's
after.  mr. feur steps out from behind the open trunk of his
old buick.

                     claire
               (walking up)
          you!

he looks up at her.

                     claire
          you think you're smart, don't you?  you
          think you got away clean.  well, i know
          you killed her.  you drowned her in the
          bathtub and got rid of her somewhere and
          i'm gonna find her, you murdering
          sonofabitch.

mr. feur stares, dazed, through the tirade.  norman arrives
at her side.

                     mr. feur
          who?

                     claire
               (scoffing)
          give me that shit.  your wife.

                     mr. feur
          i didn't kill my wife.

                     norman
               (to mr. feur)
          i'm sorry...

                     claire
               (over norman)
          then where is she?

he stares at both spencers for a moment.  then calls past
them.

                     mr. feur
          honey...

claire and norman turn.  a blond woman backs out of the
passenger seat.  she turns.  it's not the face claire has
seen.  claire looks sucker punched.
