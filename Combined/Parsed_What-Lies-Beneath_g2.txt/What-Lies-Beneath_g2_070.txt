int.  work room - day

claire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.  she
narrows her search to new england.  a screen pops up with a
list of names.  she scrolls down the list until she
finds...frank, madison elizabeth.

                     claire
          m-e-f...

claire double clicks on it, then waits breathlessly as a
blurry cyber photo fills the screen.  slowly, higher
resolution moves down the image.

it's the ghost.

under the photo is the legend:

             "disappeared - october 22, 1998"

claire stares at the familiar face, then shakily hits print.

later

claire is staring down at the girl's face on the print out.

          ...she was practically a townie.  grew up
          in bradford.

                     claire
          and she was never found?

                     voice

          nah.  she was a live wire.  had this old
          mustang fastback.  it's gone too.  most of
          her friends think she's tooling around
          mexico somewhere.  police downgraded her
          to a runaway.

                     claire
          thank you, mr...

she glances at the byline on the back of the newspaper photo.

insert

"by neil mccann"

                     claire
          ...mccann.

she hangs up.
