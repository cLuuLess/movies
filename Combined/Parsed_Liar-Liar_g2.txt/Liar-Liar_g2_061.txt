          fletcher is pacing back and forth. a group of tough
          prisoners are on the far side of the cell, trying to stay
          as far away from fletcher as they can.

                                fletcher

                    su pply ? you don't think "the
                    man's" dumped enough toxins to
                    render every dick in this cell
                    as lifeless as a beached
                    minn ow? you're damn rightj
