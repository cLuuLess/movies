                    just today?

                              fletcher
                    apparently until 9:15 tonight.
                    it's a twenty-four hour curse.

                              greta
                    yes, those are going around.

                              fletcher
                    you don't believe me.

                              greta
                    of course not.

                              fletcher
                    go ahead. ask me something
                    i ' d normally lie about.
          she thinks.

                              greta
                   a ll right. remember a few
                   months ago, i wanted a raise--

                              fletcher

                         (quickly)
                    forget it. let's not do this.

                              greta
                   -- and the firm wouldn't.give
                   me one. and i asked you if
                   you would give it to me out of
                   your own pocket and you said
                   the company wouldn't permit it
                   because it creates jealousy
                   among the other secretaries?
                   was that true or did you just
                   not want to pony up the dough?
