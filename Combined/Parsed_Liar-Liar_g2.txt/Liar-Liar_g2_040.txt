          ext. audrey's house - morning


          
          a cab speeds up to the house. fletcher runs out. audrey is
          headed to her car.

          

                              fletcher
                    audrey, wait!

                              audrey
                    wait? you know, i just had an
                    insight into myself. i ' m
                    crazy. you call me up and .
                    tell me to wait here because
                    you'll be right over and --
                    here's the crazy part -- i
                    actually wait.

                              fletcher
                    i can explain--

                              audrey
                    i missed a department meeting.
                    i. . . did you come in a cab?

                              fletcher
                    yes.

                              audrey
                    where's your car?

          ext, police impound yard - morning

          
          audrey finishes paying the impound-yard cashier and joins
          fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.

                              fletcher
                    thank you. . i can't tell you
                    how much this means to me.

                              audrey
                    i can. one thousand, six
                    hundred, and fifty-four
                    dollars and eleven cents.

                              fletcher
                    ow.

          
          at this moment we hear a hideous scraping noise -- and a
          tow-yard employee whips fletcher's bmw into view and.
          parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                    you scratched my car!

                              tow-yard employee
                    where?     .

                              fletcher
                   right there!

          

                              tow-yard employee
                    oh that? that was already
                    there.

                                 fletcher

                            (outraged)
                    why, you -- you liar! do you
                    know what i ' m going to do
                    about this?

                                tow-yard employee
                    what?

                              fletcher
                         (angrier and

                          angrier)
                    ...nothing! because if i take
                   you to small-claims court, it
                   will just drain eight hours
                   out of my life, and you
                   probably won't show up, and if
                   i finally got the judgment
                   you'd just stiff me anyway, so
                   what i'm gonna do is piss and
                   moan like an impotent jerk and
                 . then bend over and take it up
                   the tail pipe!

                              tow-yard employee
                    you've been here before,
                    haven't you?
          he flips fletcher the keys and goes.

                                audrey
                    well i can't remember when
                    i've had more fun, now if
                    you'll excuse me, i have a
                    class.
          she starts out.

                                fletcher
                    audrey, wait. i want to talk
                    to you about this boston
                    situation.

                             . audrey
                    what do you want to say?

                                fletcher
                   you can't go. it's not fair.
                   taking max three thousand
                   miles away is not fair.

          

                              audrey
                    let' s define "fair." last
                  Â· night a five-year old boy was
                    crushed because his father
                    lied to him about coming to
                    his birthday party. fair?

                              fletcher
                    last night--

                             audrey
                   -- was none of my business.
                   when it happened two years ago
                   it was my business, but now i
                   don't have to care anymore.
                   see, that's the magic of
                   div orce . but it does matter
                   to max. everything you do
                   matters to him... and
                   everything you don't do.

                              fletcher
                   all right-- now let me tell
                   you something...you're
                   absolutely right. i'm guilty
                   of all charges. i'm throwing
                   myself on the mercy of your
                   -court.
          audrey doesn't know what to say. fletcher seems very
          sincere, but she can't trust him.

                              fletcher {cont'd)
                   i have an idea. i'll come
                   over tonight, right after
                   court lets out and play with
                   m ax. have him invite some
                   fri ends over. we'll have a
                   game and everything. then,
                   you and i can sit down and
                   talk.

                             audrey
                   we're suppose to be on a plane

                   tonight--

                             fletcher
                   no, audrey. just talk to me
                   abou t this first. please.
                   au drey, i've lost you. don't
                   make me lose max, too.

                             audrey
                   you're really coming?

          

                              fletcher
                    this is iron-clad. this is
                    the mother of all promises.
                    what time?

                              audrey
                    ...six?

                              fletcher
                    ten-to-six.

                               au dr ey

                          (unsure)
                    all right... only if i tell
                    max you're coming and you
                    don't show up and i have to
                    see that look on max's face --
                    that heartbreaking look-- it's
                    boston, fletcher.

                              fletcher.
                    i will be there.

          
          as audrey gets in her car -- .

                              audrey
                   i hope so. do you know what
                   your son was doing at nine-
                   fif teen las t ni ght? he was
                   making a wish on his birthday
                   c ake. he was wishing that,
                   for just one day, his dad
                   couldn't tell a lie.
          she drives away. fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
          when a new thought strikes him.

                              fletcher
                   oh my god! that-'s it! an
                   innocent kid - - a heartfelt
                   plea-- a birthday wish! sure,
                   it' s impossible --but it
                   'makes sense!..! if he can wish
                   it, he can unwish it!
