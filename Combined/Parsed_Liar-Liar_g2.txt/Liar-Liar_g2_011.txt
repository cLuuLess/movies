          unattractive hairdo. a large gift basket is on her desk.

                              jane
                    hi, mr. reid.

                    it's for mr. allan. it's his
                    anniversary.

                    committee meeting still

                          (as she goes)
                    yep...
          fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket,
          scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there

                              max
                    what are you doing?

                              fletcher
                    oh, i'm... fixing the card,
                          (shows him the
                           old card)
                    look, they spelled mr. allan's
                    name wrong. have an apple.
