          int. miranda's office - afternoon


          
          ...where a troubled fred rand is talking to miranda, a
          beautiful, steely partner.

                              fred
                    i can't do it.

                              m iranda
                    fred, it's your duty to
                    present the strongest case
                    possible.

                              fred
                    the strongest case possible,
                    consistent with the truth.

                              miranda
                   let the judge decide what's
                   true. that's what he gets
                   paid for. you get paid to
                   win.

                              fred
                   if you insist on my taking it
                   to trial, i'll represent mrs.
                   cole aggressively and
                   ethically. but, miranda -- i
                   won't lie.
          miranda looks out her window, calculating.

                              miranda
                   then we'll just have to find
                   someone who'will.
