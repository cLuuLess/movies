          ext. jerry's car - morning

          jerry and audrey are driving. audrey's holding a couple of
          airline tickets.

                                 audr ey
                            (re: tickets)
                       jerry, these are for tomorrow.

                                 jerry
                       the company wants me to get
                       started right away.

                                 audrey
                   i can't just pick up and move
                   to boston with two days
                   notice.

                              jerry
                   ju st come check it out. you
                   a nd max, see the town. let's
                 . pick out a place together.
                   then, if you want to turn me
                   down and scar me for life,
                   fine.

                                 audrey
                   it's just not that simple...
                   what about my job? i've been
                   at ucla three years.

                                 jerry
                   it's new england. they're
                   lousy with colleges. you
                   can't swing a bat back there
                   without hitting a college.

          
                    you'd get a job there in a
                    second.

                              audrey
                    there are other factors
                    involved.

                          (points)
                    t here they are now.       路.
          they pull up in front of fletcher's building where fletcher
          and max are waiting. fletcher's still reviewing a file.
          as audrey gets out of jerry's car, max runs over.

                              audrey
                    did you have fun? how were
                    the wrestling matches?

                              fletcher
                    big fun. manly fun. am i
                    right, maxie?

                              max

                          (half-heartedly)
                    it was fun..

                                                                    路

                              fletcher
                         (re: audrey)

                    matches ? did you have fun?

                    birthday man!
          max and jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.   jerry gives max
          a light punch on the arm.

                              jerry
                    one-two-three-four-five... and
                    one for good luck.

                              fletcher

                    the child!
