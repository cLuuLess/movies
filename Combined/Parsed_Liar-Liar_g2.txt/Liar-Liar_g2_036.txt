              int. fletcher's office

              he's dialing the phone.

                                  fletcher
                        answer, answer, answer...

          

               intercut with audrey's car

          

                    audrey
          hello.

                    fletcher
          audrey, let me explain.
          something has happened to me--

                    audrey
          fletcher, something else is
          about to happen to you.

                    fletcher.
          what do you mean?

                    audrey
          max and i are moving to
          boston.

                    fletcher
          what?!

                    audrey
          jerry asked me to marry him.
          he wants max and i to fly with
          him this weekend to pick out a
          house. and i'm going to go.
          god knows i don't have any
          reason to stay here.

                    fletcher
               (panicking)    .
          wait, you can't move! if you
          take max away... i'll
          practically never see him.

                    audrey
          well then you'll have pretty
          much the same relationship you
          have with him now.

                    fletcher
          audrey, please.... is this
          because of what i just said on
          the phone?

                    audrey
          that was the straw and this is
          the camel's back saying
          goodbye.

                    fletcher
          where are you?

                    audrey
          heading home.

          

                                 fletcher
                    when you gee there, stay
                    there. i'll be right over.
                    we have to talk.

                               audrey

                    fletcher--

                               fletcher
                    i'll be right- there!

          
          he hangs up and heads for the door.      it opens and miranda
          enters.

                               fletcher (cont'd)
                    aaaah!

                               miranda
                   flet cher. fletcher, fletcher,
                   fletcher. i must confess--
                   after last night's incident, i
                   was. . . hurt. so hurt. i was
                   tempted to do whatever little
                   things lie in my power to
                   scuttle your chances of making
                   partner.
          fletcher is frightened.

                              miranda (cont'd)
                   but then i thought, "no,
                   that 's not fair. fletcher
                   didn't mean to insult me."

                         (straightening
                          his tie)
                   "it was just some massive,
                   boneheaded misunderstanding,
                   and fletcher is very, very
                   sorry."
          fletcher smiles.   it looks like he's off the hook, until--

                              miranda (cont'd)
                    isn't that right, fletcher?

                             fletcher
                        (in agony)
                   uh -- not really, no.

                              miranda
                          (stunned, angry)
                   n o ? no?! what are you
                   sayi ng? have you no respect
                   for me?!

          

                               fletcher
                    none, whatsoever. i mean, i ' d
                    like to respect you, and if it
                    weren't for your mistreatment
                    of the associates, your
                    rudeness to the staff, and the
                    fact that your work sucks, i
                    would.

                              m iranda
                    but -- what about last night?

                               fletcher
                    i was afraid you wouldn't
                    support my partnership if i
                    turned you down. plus, i have
                    an immature need for sexual
                    conquests.
