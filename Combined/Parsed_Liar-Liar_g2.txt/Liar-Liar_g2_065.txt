          fletcher's on the phone.   he sails passed a parked police

          car.

                                fletcher
                          (into phone)
                    shelton, jerry shelton.
                    what time's that flight leave?
                    7:50. thank you.
                          (checks his

                           watch)
                    oh, shit! shit!! shit!
          fletcher spots the flashing lights.

                              fletcher
                    shiiiiit!!!
          he pulls over -- so quick he jumps the curb.

                              police officer
                    would you step out of the car,
                    please?
          fletcher obeys.

                              fletcher
                    listen; i know i'm driving a
                    little crazy but i have an
                    emergency to attend to...
          the cop's just getting off his walkie talkie.

                              police officer
                    i'm impounding this vehicle.

                              fletcher
                   w h y ? what for? for changing
                   lanes?

                              police officer
                   i just ran your tags through
                   the computer. you've got.
                   seventeen unpaid parking
                   tickets.

                              fletcher
                   no ! i paid them! this
                   morning! that's the truth!      i
                   swear!!

                             police officer
                   not according to the computer.

          

                                  fletcher
                     the computer is wrong! it
                   ' hasn't been updated. the
                     computer's a liar!

                                 police officer
                       you can straighten it out at
                       the impound yard.

                                  fletcher
                             (checks his
                              watch, firmly)

                       no!

                                 police officer
                       no?

                                 fletcher
                    that's right, no! i'm not
                    gonna lose my son because some
                    stupid clerk was too lazy to
                    update the computer.
                          (getting cockier.
                           as he goes)
                    now if you want to follow me,
                  . you can follow me and take the
                    car after i get where i'm
                    going. i'm a lawyer and i
                    k now my rights! understand?!

                                                          cut to:
          a tow truck drives away with fletcher's car, leaving
          fletcher stranded.
