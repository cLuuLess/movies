          int. courtroom - day

          the judge is pissed. suddenly the bailiff helps in the
          severly beaten fletcher. the entire courtroom is shocked.

                              bailiff
                    i found him like this in the
                    bathroom. somebody beat the
                    hell out of him.

                              judge stevens
                    who did this?

                               fletcher

                          (truthfully)
                    a madman, your honor.. a
                    desperate fool at the end of
                    his pitiful.rope.

                              judge stevens
                   -what did he look like?

                              fletcher

                         (describing

                          himself)
                    about five eleven, hundred
                    eighty-five pounds, crazed
                    look in his eye.

                                 judge stevens
                    bailiff, have the deputies
                    search the building.
          a hubbub rises. he bangs the gavel.

                             judge stevens (cont'd)
                   under the circumstances, i
                   have no choice but to recess
                   this case until tomorrow
                   morning at nine.
          fletcher smiles serenly -- until --

                              judge stevens (cont'd)
                    -- unless, of course, you
                    think you can still proceed?
          fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid
          answering, but he can't repress the truth.

          

                                 judge stevens (cont'd)
                    can you?

                               fletcher
                    yes, i can.

                              judge stevens
                    splendid. i admire your
                    courage, mr. reid. i'll give
                    you a few minutes to compose
                    yourself, and then we'll get
                    started.
          fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.
