          int. courtroom - morning


          
          a winded fletcher joins virginia at the respondent's table,

                             virginia
                   you look like you're having a
                   rough morning.

                              fletcher
                    i've had better.
          he winces as he recognizes the words. then, an extremely
          wealthy, respectable industrialist, richard cole enters
          with his attorney, dana appleton, young, brisk, confident.

                              dana
                   good morning, fletcher.

                                fletcher
                   dana.         "

          

                                richard
                    all right, virginia, how much
                    will it take to put an end to
                    this?

                              fletcher
                    fifty per cent of your estate.
          richard is shocked.

                                dana
                    fifty per cent? with a pre-
                    nup and proof of adultery?
                    what's your case?

                               fletcher
                    our case is simply this. . .
          fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he can't
          get the words out. he tries to force out sounds, but
          succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

                                dana        .
                    interesting, though based on
                    your track record, i expected
                    a little more.
          nearing panic, fletcher whirls to his briefcase and grabs
          the brief.

                                fletcher   ..
                   wa it! wait!    i've got it in
                   writing!
          but when dana tries to take the document, the astonished
          fletcher finds himself physically unable to release it.

                                dana
                    let go!

                              fletcher
                    i'm trying!

          
          he involuntarily snatches the document away and it pulls
          him to a nearby trash can where he throws it out.
          at this moment the bailiff calls.

                                bailiff
                   all rise for the honorable
                   judge william stevens.

          

                              dana
                    very funny, fletcher. you
                    want to play hardball, i'm
                    game.
          judge stevens takes the bench.

          

                              judge stevens
                    calling case ba 09395, richard
                    cole versus virginia cole.
                    how're we doing this morning,
                    counsel?

                              dana
                    fine, thank you.

                             judge stevens
                   and you, mr. reid?

                              fletcher
                    well, i'm a little upset about
                    a bad sexual episode i had
                    last night--
          fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
          he just said. after an awkward silence--

                              judge stevens

                         (dryly)
                   well, you're still young.
                   it'll happen more and more.
                   in the meantime, what do you
                   say we get. down to business?
                   first, mr. reid, i see that
                   your client was previously
                   represented by mr. rand of
                   your office.

                             fletcher
                   yes, your honor.

                              judge stevens
                    i take it you're seeking to
                    substitute in as counsel?

                             fletcher
                   yes, your honor.

                              judge stevens
                   fine , fine. and for the
                   record, the reason is?

          

                                 fletcher
                    mr. rand had severe ethical
                    objections to my client's
                    case.
          fletcher is incredulous. somehow his greatest asset in the
          world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

                                judge stevens
                    i take it you don't share the
                    same ethical objections, mr.
                    reid?

                                 fletcher
                    i have lower standards, your
                    honor.

                                judge stevens
                    i see. well, if mrs. cole
                    wants the substitution of
                    counsel, i'll allow it. is
                    that what you want, mrs. cole?
          virginia looks to the judge, then to fletcher, whose
          unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.

                                 virginia

                            (unsure)
                    yes?

                                judge stevens
                    fine.

                             virginia
                        (aside, to

                         fletcher)
                   what are you doing?

                                 fletcher

                            (worried)

                                                                       .
                   i don't know.
                         (to judge, with

                          some

                          desperation)
                   your honor, i ' d like a
                   continuance!

                             judge stevens "
                   this case has already been
                   delayed several times, mr.
                   reid.

          

                                 fletcher
                    i realize that, your honor,
                    but i ' d really, really, really
                    like a continuance.

                                 judge stevens
                    i'll have to hear good cause,
                    counselor. what's the
                    problem?

          fletcher's p.o.v.

          
          the room begins to spin slowly -- then faster -- then
          faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

          fletcher's face

                              fletcher
                    i can't lie!

                                 judge stevens

                            (impatient)
                   commendable, mr. reid, but i'm
                   still waiting for the good
                   caus e. now, do you have it or
                 . not?

                    '            fletcher

                            (truthful)
                    not.

                              judge stevens
                    motion for a continuance
                    denied. is there any chance
                    of a settlement in this case?

                                dana
                    i don't think so, your honor.
                    mr. reid made it abundantly
                    clear that the last thing in
                    the world he wanted was to --

                               fletcher

                          (desperate)

                    settle! settle! settle!
          dana and mr. cole look at fletcher with surprise.

                                judge stevens
                    there appears to have been a
                    change in strategy. let's go
                    to my chambers and negotiate.
          he bangs the gavel.
