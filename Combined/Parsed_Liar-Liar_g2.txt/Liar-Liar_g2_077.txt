          ext. tarmac - day

          fletcher is banging on the windows. people on the plane
          point, stare in amazement.
          fletcher looks ahead, sees the stairs about to crash into
          the wing! fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.
          at the last second, finds the one that lowers the stairs.
          he surfs under the wing...
          ...    and raises up the stairs at the other side.
          fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally
          spots. . .

          max, audrey and jerry seated in the bulkhead
          max has the window seat, audrey arid jerry are next to him.
          audrey has on her headset and jerry is looking for his
          seatbelt. neither sees fletcher.
          fletcher screams to get their attention. but it's too

          noisy.
          then, fletcher looks ahead and his eyes go wide!

          fletcher's pov
          the runway is ending!.

          
          just then, max looks up...sees his dad. audrey is now
          trying to help jerry find his seat belt.

          

                                    audrey
                          (checks under his

                           seat)
                     it's right here, honey.

                                    m ax
                     mom!   mom!!               '

                               audrey
                     just a second, max.

                               max
                     mom, it's dad!

                               au drey
                     w hat? what about dad?
          audrey turns. then she sees fletcher waving weakly...

                                  audrey
                     fletcher?!

          at that instant -- the plane makes a sharp turn!
          but the stairs don't! they keeps going straight, heading Â·
          right for the end of the runway and a parked loaded luggage

          cart. . -
          and bam!   fletcher, the stairs, the luggage all go flying!

          
          audrey strains to watch as fletcher lands hard onto a

          mountain of baggage!

          close on fletcher

          
          with all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's
          in one piece, and then collapses in defeat.

                                                      cut to:
