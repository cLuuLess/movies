          int. miranda's office - night


          
          pan around miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
          adorned with fletcher's shoes...
          to the credenza, where fletcher's pants hang...
          to the lamp, where fletcher's shorts swing...
          to the desk, where a ravished miranda lies next to
          fletcher. superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

                                miranda
                    s o . . . was it good for you?
          without thinking, fletcher responds in the most astonishing
          way possible-- he tells the truth.

                              fletcher
                    i've had better.
          miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
          compared to the look of shock on fletcher's face.
