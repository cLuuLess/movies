          ext. playground - day

          they're in the playground just outside the classroom.

          

                              fletcher
                    monster-max.

          

                              max
                    dadzilla. you came to play
                    catch?

                              fletcher
                    no. i ' d like to, but i can't
                    right now.
          max is disappointed again.

                               fletcher (cont'd)
                    i ' m sorry i missed your party
                    la st night. how was your
                    uncle glen?

                              max
                    stupid. his big nose and
                    stupid orange hair...

                              fletcher
                    that's why he should have worn
                    make-up.
          fletcher elbows max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
          max doesn't laugh.

                      '       max .
                    i want to play kickball with
                    my friends.-

                              fletcher
                    yeah, okay, urn... your mother
                    told me about... the wish you
                    made last night. it came
                    true.
          max is amazed.

                              max
                    really? you mean you have to
                    tell the truth?

                              fletcher
                    yes.

          

                             max
                   no matter what?

                             fletcher
                   no matter what.

          
          max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.

                              max
                    is wrestling real?

                              fletcher
                    in the olympics, yes.      on    .
                    channel 23, no.

                              max
                    will sitting close to the tv
                    set make me go blind?

                               fletcher
                    not in a million years.

                               max
                    if i keep making this face--
                         (makes a horrible

                          face)
                    will it get stuck that way?

                               fletcher
                    uh-uh.

                               max
                   .if i go in the water right
                   after lunch, will i drown?

                               fletcher
                    only if you can't 'swim.

                              max
                    why do i have to eat squash?

                               fletcher
                    because your mom buys it.

                             max
                   how come you're always too
                   busy to play with me?
          the sudden shift in tone startles fletcher. he feels
          awful.

                               fletcher
                   i . . . i don't know. i ' m . . . hey,
                   you know i'm coming over
                   to nig ht. we're gonna play
                   together.

                               max
                   baseball?

          

                                fletcher
                  . yes! this is absolutely an
                    a-number one promise. you and
                    i -- tonight -- baseball.
          fletcher and max do their ritual "five" slap.

                                fletcher
                      now, listen, max, i need a
                      favor from you. i ' m in a
                      little trouble today. i need
                      you to take that wish back.

                                max
                      so you can lie?

                                fletcher
                      not to you.

                                max
                      to who?

                                fletcher
                      max, sometimes grownups...
                      need to lie. it's hard to
                      explain, but i f . . . look,
                      here's an example. when mommy
                      was pregnant with you, she
                      gained a little weight.
                      se venty pounds. i thought she
                      was gonna give birth to a car.
                      but she'd say to me "how do i
                      lo ok?" so i'd say, "oh,
                      honey, you're beautiful,
                      you're glowing.11 otherwise, i
                      would've hurt mommy's
                      fee ling s. understand?
          max nods.

                                max
                      you didn't think she was
                      beautiful.

                                fletcher
                      right. no... max, i don't
                      know how to get along in the
                      grown-up world if i have to
                      stick to the truth. i could
                      lose my case, i could lose my
                      promotion, i could even lose,
                      my job... do you understand?
          max shakes his head "no."

          

                                fletcher (cont'd)
                      will you help me anyway?
          a moment -- then max reluctantly nods.

                                 fletcher (cont'd)
                      that's my boy!
          fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... he
          takes out two birthday hats. he puts one on max and one on
          himself.

                                fletcher (cont'd)
                      now, do whatever you did last
                      night... only this time, make
                      an un-wish.
          not really happy, max turns to the candles on the cake. he
          takes a breath-- and blows them out.

                                max
                      i did it. ^

                                fletcher
                      great! great! now to test --

                                                                   ·

          
          fletcher spots an attractive female teacher. fletcher
          hurries to her and says something. a moment. then she

          slaps him.
          fletcher returns to his son.

                                max
                      did it work?

                                   fletcher            .       .
                           (rubbing his sore

                            cheek)
                      not like i ' d hoped. did you
                      really unwish it?
          max nods.

                                   max
                      only...

                                   fletcher
                      only what?

                                   max
                      yesterday, when i wished it, i
                      r ea lly meant it. this time
                      when i unwished it i only did
                      it 'cause you told me to.

          

                                fletcher
                         (losing patience)
                    well, then do it again.        only
                    this time, mean it.

                                max
                    i can't.

                                fletcher
                    why not?!

                                max
                    because i don't want you to
                    lie.

                                fletcher
                    i explained this to you! i
                    have to lie. everybody lies!
                    mommy lies, even the wonderful
                    jerry lies--

                                        '

                                max
                    but you're the only one who
                    makes me feel bad.

          fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.

                               ms. berry

                          (calling)
                    max, recess 'is over, come on
                    in.

                              max
                    i have to go.

                                fletcher
                    i am coming over, tonight,
                    max. you believe me, don't
                    you?
          max hesitates, then nods.

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                    i'll see you tonight, buddy...
                    that's a promise.
          max heads back to class. fletcher picks up the cake, looks
          at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.
