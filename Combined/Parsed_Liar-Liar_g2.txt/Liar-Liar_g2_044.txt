          ext. skyscraper - day


          
          a worried and preoccupied fletcher is heading toward his
          office building when a macho attorney passes by.

          

                              macho attorney
                    yo, fletcher! how's it
                    hanging?

                               fletcher
                    short and shrivelled.
          fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots philip. he
          shields his face with his briefcase. philip recognizes him
          anyway.

                               philip
                    fletcher! i'm still waiting
                    for your call. i guess you
                    must've lost my card --

                               fletcher
                    no --

                              philip
                    or my phone was busy --

                               fletcher
                    no --

                                                                   Â·

          

                              philip
                    or you just forgot --

                              fletcher
                    no --

                               philip
                          (cannot be

                           discouraged)
                    or something. so anyway,' why
                    don't you swing by my place
                    around seven-thirty!
          philip starts off, when fletcher calls after him
          resolutely.

                              fletcher
                    philip... i don't want to come
                    over to your house!
          a long moment, then --

                               philip
                   fi n e ! we'll go out! there's
                   this new karaoke bar i've been
                   dying to try. i'll pick you
                   up at your office! seven-
                   thirty! !
          and he runs off.   frustrated, fletcher hurries on.
