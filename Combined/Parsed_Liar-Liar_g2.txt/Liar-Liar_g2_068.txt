          int. philip's car - day

          philip's driving fletcher.

                              fletcher
                    you're saving my life, philip.

                              philip
                    you know, it's funny, but for
                    some reason i was beginning to
                    think you didn't like me.
                    isn't that silly?

                               fletcher .
                    no. it's not silly.       i don't
                    like you.

                               philip
                    what?

                               fletcher
                   i don't like you. i'm sorry.
                   i find you boring. i hate
                   ch ara des . and you wouldn't
                   know a good time if it sat on
                   your face.
                          (feels bad)
                   i'm sorry. it was easier than
                   telling you how i really felt.
                   are you upset?
          a moment, then:

                               philip
                   no. to be honest, i don't
                   like you either. you treat
                   people like obstacles and you
                   cheat at charades. .

          

                                fletcher
                     then why are you always trying
                     to socialize with me?

                                philip
                     you're a client. i figured if
                     i didn't try to be your
                     friend, you'd get a new
                     accountant.

                                fletcher
                     philip, i don't like you as a
                     person, but i'm crazy about
                     you as my accountant. i ' d
                     never hire a new accountant.
                     never!

                               philip
                     so we don't have to like each
                     other anymore?

                               fletcher    -
                     not at all.

                 .              philip
                     all right. sooner i get you
                     Â·to the airport, sooner i can
                     dump your sorry ass off.
