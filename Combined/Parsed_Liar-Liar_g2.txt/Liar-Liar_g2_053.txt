          int. courtroom - day

          the judge settles in. mr. allan and a smug miranda look on
          from the gallery.

                             judge stevens
                   you may proceed, mr. reid. .
          everyone turns to fletcher in anticipation.    in a voice
          quaking with fear...

          

                              virginia
                    sorry. one of the kids threw
                    up in the car.
          virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children
          sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.

                               fletcher

                          (incredulous

                           whisper)
                    you brought your kids. . . to
                    your divorce?

                              virginia
                         (by way of

                          explanation)
                    sympathy.

                              fletcher
                    well, it's working. i feel
                    sorry for them already.
          the judge bangs the gavel.

                               judge stevens
                    ms. appleton, you may begin.

                                                     cut to:
          dana appleton questions bryson, a private investigator.
          fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, nervously drinks
          from a glass of water at his table.

                              bryson
                         (referring to his

                          notes)
                    -- from march six through june
                    twelve, i surveilled mrs. cole
                    at the behest of mr. cole.
                    during that period, i noted
                    that mr. cole left each day
                    between seven-forty and seven-
                    fifty. thereafter, mrs. cole
                    would frequently have a male
                    visitor arrive and stay for
                    one to four hours. i was able
                    to take several photographs of
                    the male visitor.
          he shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. fletcher takes a

          huge drink.           .

                              dana
                    i see. and do you .know what
                    mrs. cole and her male visitor

          
                    did during their frequent...
                    visits?

                              bryson
                    well, they were pretty good
                    about keeping the shades drawn
                    -- but i sure was able to
                    hear. i made an audiotape of
                    one such., "session."
          h e hands her the tape. fletcher refills his glass.

                              dana
                    with the court's permission, i
                    would like to play the tape.

                              fletcher
                    your honor, i object!

                              judge stevens
                    and why is that, mr. reid?

                               fletcher
                          (can't help

                           himself)
                    because it's devastating to my
                   ·case.
          the judge is startled by his candor.

                               judge stevens
                    overruled..
          as dana pops the tape into a player, fletcher anxiously

          downs the glass.
          periodically cutting to virginia, mr. cole, dan and the
          thirsty fletcher, we hear virginia and her visitor engaged
          in intense physical activity.

                              male visitor (o.s.)
                    so , what did you say? you
                    ready?

                              virginia (o.s.)
                    oh boy am i ready.

                             male visitor (o.s.)
                   good. let me help you off
                   with that. come on, lie down.

                              virginia (o.s.)
                   wai t a minute. do you have
                   protection?

          

                               male visitor ( o . s . )
                    right here. okay, now i ' m
                    gonna show you something new.

                               virginia ( o . s . )
                    oh, i've never done it like
                    this before.                    .·.

                              male visitor (o.s.)
                    don't worry, you can take it.
                    oh yeah. that's it. there
                    you go. yes! yes!
          we hear labored rhythmic breathing.

                              male visitor (o.s) (cont'd)
                    yes, yes, yes --
          as dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
          more labored breathing, building intensity and --

                               male visitor (o.s.) (cont'd)
                    oh yeah, bring it on .home --
                    yes! yes! yes!

                              virginia (o.s.)
                    yes! yes! yes!
          the groans reach their incredible climax. there's a still
          moment. . .
          as the shy court reporter, the macho bailiffs and the no-
          nonsense judge all mop their brows, dana shuts off the
          tape. she turns to fletcher with a satisfied smile.

                              dana
                    your witness.

                               fletcher
                    no questions.

                              judge stevens
                    no questions? .

                              virginia
                    no questions?

                                fletcher
                          (afraid to ask

                           any)
                    no questions.

                                dana

                          (triumphant)
                    petitioner rests.

          

                                 judge stevens
                    all right, mr. reid. you may
                    proceed.

                                 fletcher
                            (to himself)
                    how?!
          gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
          water, and moves to the lecturn. he's about to speak...
          when a wonderful feeling sweeps through him.
          after a momement, he grins.

                              fletcher (cont'd)
                    would the court be willing to
                    grant me a short bathroom
                    break?

                              judge stevens
                    it can't wait?

                              fletcher
                    not unless you want to mop up.

                                 judge stevens

                            (frustrated)
                    all right, but get back in
                    here immediately so .we can
                    finish this.
          fletcher beams. then necessity compels him to race out.
