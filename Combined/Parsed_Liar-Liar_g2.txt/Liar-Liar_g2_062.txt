                                fletcher
                   just the truth, greta.
                   fifteen years of being stuck
                   in a lie is nowhere near as
                   powerful as one day of being
                   stuck in the truth.

          
                         (checks his

                          watch)

                    thanks again, greta!
                         (as he runs off
                          he calls back to

                          her)

                    i need you and i couldn't file
                    a paperclip without you!
          greta smiles, then catches herself, and quickly regains her
          "composure".
