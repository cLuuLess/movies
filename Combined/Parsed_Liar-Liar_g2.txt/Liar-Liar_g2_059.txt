          max and audrey at the table. the airline tickets jerry
          gave her are in front of them.

                                max
                      when would we move?

                                 audrey
                      soon. my semester's almost
                      over. you only have a week
                      left of school... you like
                      jerry don't you?
                            (he nods)
                      so what do you say, should we
                      check it out? jerry wants us
                      to come with him tonight. he
                      has to pick out a place to
                      live and he really wants our
                      help?

                                 max
                      could i get a sled for when it
                      snows?

                                audrey
                      of course you can.
          max thinks, then:

                                 max
                      okay.
