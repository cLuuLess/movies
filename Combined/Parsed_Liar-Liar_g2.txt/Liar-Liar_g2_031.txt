          int. judge stevens's chambers - morning

          dana and an apprehensive fletcher sit before the judge

                             dana
                   your honor, under the terms of
                   the prenuptual agreement, if
                   mrs. cole commits adultery,
                   she is entitled to nothing.
                   we have in our possession an
                   audiotape made by a licensed
                   private investigator of an
                   explicit act of sexual
                   congress with a man who is not
                   her husband.

                             judge stevens
                   sounds pretty damning, mr.
                   reid.

                             fletcher
                   it certainly does.

                             dana
                   however, my client has no
                   desire to see his ex-wife
                   destitute. against my advice,
                   he's willing to offer her a
                   cash settlement of.two point
                   four million dollars.

                             judge stevens
                   two four seems like a pretty
                   fair offer, mr. reid.

                             fletcher
                   fantastically fair.
                   phenominally fair. in fact,
                   i'd say beyond fair, bordering
                   on stupid.
          dana fumes. the judge finds fletcher's boldness
          refreshing.

                             judge stevens
                   what are you suggesting, mr.
                   rei d? that ms. appleton's
                   willingness to proffer such an
                   offer betrays a lack of faith
                   in her position?

                             fletcher
                        (utterly sincere)
                   no, not at all. she's got my
                   client dead to rights. when

          
                    attorneys go to sleep at
                    night, they dream of having a
                    case as strong as hers.

                              dana
                    can the sarcasm, reid. all
                    right, i admit it -- i've seen
                    you make even the lamest case
                    fly. but this time i have
                    you. even clarence darrow
                    couldn't explain this away.
          she brandishes the audiotape.

                              judge samioan
                    wel l, mr. reid? without a
                    dynamite explanation, i'd say
                    you're dead in the water.
                    how's you client's story?

                              fletcher
                    the best that money can buy,
                    y o u r honor.       Â·

                              judge stevens
                    strong corroborating evidence?

                              fletcher
                    we have evidence that you are
                    not going to-believe.
          despite herself, dana is beginning to look worried.

                              judge stevens
                    you're pretty confident how
                    this trial is going to come
                    out, eh, mr. reid?

                              fletcher
                         (hopeless) .
                    "confident" is too weak a
                    word, your honor. i am
                    certain what will happen if i
                    take this puppy to trial. the
                    verdict will be a stunning,
                    humiliating defeat that will
                    cut a spectacularly promising
                    legal career off at the knees.
          fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but dana
          thinks he's speaking about her. she buckles.

          

                                dana
                      all right! double the offer!
                      four point eight! and not a
                      penny more.
                            (venomous, to

                             fletcher)
                      bastard!
          she storms out, leaving an astounded fletcher behind.

                                judge stevens
                      you are some negotiator, mr.
                      reid. if your client has half
                      a brain, she'll jump at the
                      offer.

                                                     cut to:

                                virginia
                      no!

          
          we are --
