          int. volvo - moving / fletcher's office - morning

          audrey is driving max, who wears his new baseball uniform
          when her cellular phone rings. she picks it up.
          we intercut between car and office.

                               fletcher

                    audrey--

                              audrey'
                    hey, fletcher. t was
                    wondering if you were going to
                    still pick up max after school
                    today.

                               fletcher
                   i don't think i can. i had a
                   case i was certain would
                   settle and it didn't. i have
                   to go to trial this afternoon,
                   god help me.

          

                              audrey
                         (not believing

                          him)
                   right.

                              fletcher
                   it's true... i really do want
                   to see max, today.
          fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.

                             fletcher (cont'd)
                   how about that. i really do.

                             audrey

                        (cynically)
                   but things keep coming up at
                   the last minute.

                              fletcher
                   yes, but-this time it's
                   different.

                            audrey
                   i see. and how is that?

                                         .                         Â·

                               fletcher
                         ( he walked into

                          it)
                   this time i'm telling the
                   truth.

                             audrey
                   but last night you weren't?

                             fletcher
                   no.

                             audrey
                   what were you doing?

                             fletcher
                   having sex.

                             audrey
                         (barely holding
                          her temper),
                   it must have been with someone
                   very "special."

                             fletcher
                   no. it was with someone i
                   don't even like. but i
                   thought it would help my
                   career and at the moment that

          
                   seemed more important than
                   attending my son's birthday!

                                 a u d r ey
                   m y god!!
          she slams down the phone.
