          an involuntary whimper from fletcher.

                              miranda
                    oh, that's right. you used to
                    work together. .tell me, what
                    do you think of mr. allah?
          fl etc he r gulps. this is it. his career is history. he's
          trying to hold it back, but--

                              miranda
                    i said... what do you think of
                    mr. allan?

                              fletcher     .
                    he's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.
          de an silence. then --mr. allan bursts into raucous
          laughter. he is joined by everyone except miranda, who
          looks on, stunned. everyone pounds the table in hysterics.

          

                                 mr. allan
                    marvelous! marvelous! that's
                    what i love most about this
                    firm-- the collegial
                    atmosphere, the hearty good-
                    fellowship!
          miranda is incensed.

                              mr. allan (cont'd)
                    and thanks for those flowers
                    for my anniversary. my wife
                    loved them.

                                 fletcher
                    well, i'm due in court... bye-
