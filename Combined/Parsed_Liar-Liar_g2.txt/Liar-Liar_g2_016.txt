          int. fletcher's study - morning

          fletcher types on his computer.   he's been up all night.
          he leans back, rubs his eyes. when he opens them he sees
          max standing there in pajamas. fletcher smiles.

                              fletcher
                    max factor... happy birthday.
                    how old are you today?
                    t h ir t y ? forty?

                              max
                    five.

                              fletcher
                   well, you've held up well. i
                   only wish there was some way
                   to commemorate such an
                   occasion, some small symbol to
                   mark this day, like....
          fletcher produces --

                               fletcher
                    . . . a present! .

          
          max eyes it with wonder.

                             max
                   what is it?

                              fletcher
                         (no idea)
                   it's... it's.
                         (it hits him)
                   a surprise.
          max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the
          box open, revealing, a baseball, glove, dodger's cap, and

          full major league style uniform.

                             max
                   baseball stuff!

          

          

                                                                       _j

          

          

                                  fletcher
                       baseball stuff.

                                 max
                            (hugging his dad)
                       will you play catch with me?

                                 fletcher            'Â·

                                 fletcher
                       tonight. after your party,
                       you have my word on it.
          max nods sadly as fletcher turns back to his work.
