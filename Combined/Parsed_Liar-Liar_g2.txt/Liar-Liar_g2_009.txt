          int. skyscraper lobby - afternoon


          
          fletcher grabs the daily journal, paying for it with a
          handful of change. his son takes this in.
          on their way to the elevators fletcher and max pass philip,
          a dweebish bore.

                                philip
                    fletcher!

                                fletcher
                    philip!

                              philip
                    and this must be max!

                             fletcher
                        (trying to brush
                         him off)
                 . yes. yes it is. well, it was
                   good seeing you--
          fletcher starts off with max, when philip calls after him.

                                philip
                    you know, ethel and i had a
                    blast at our last little get-
                    together.

                                fletcher
                    oh, me too. i can never get
                    enough of charades. we'll
                    have to do it again sometime.
          fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the
          door's closing impededby philip's foot.

                                philip
                    when?

                                fletcher
                    soon.
          the door again begins to close... when philip stops it.

                             philip
                   how 'bout tonight?

          

                               fletcher
                    not that soon. i'm taking max
                    to see wrestling--

                              philip
                    we love wrestling.     we could--

                              fletcher
                    i don't think so. see, max is
                    really shy around strangers.
          max looks up at fletcher.    he isn't.

                                fletcher (cont'd)
                    tell you what -- give me your
                    card as a reminder. i'll call
                    y o u . soon. promise.

                              philip
                    great!
          philip hands him his card just as the door closes.
