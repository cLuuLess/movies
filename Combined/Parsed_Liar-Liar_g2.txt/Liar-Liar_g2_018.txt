          alluring woman in her early thirties/ review the document
          he spent the previousÂ·night putting together.

          

                                virginia
                    this is good. this is really
                    smart.

                                fletcher
                   thank you.

                                virginia
                   only i t ' s . . . like not true.
                   every word of it is a lie.
          fletcher and miranda exchange glances.

                             virginia (cont'd)
                   i mean... isn't that a
                   problem?

                                fletcher
                   mrs. cole, the only problem
                   here is that after you've
                   provided years of faithful
                   service and loving support, of
                   raising his children -- they
                   are his?

                              virginia
                   h m ? oh yeah. one for sure.

                               fletcher
                   after all that, your husband
                   wants to deny you a fair share
                   of the marital assets based on
                   one single act of

                                            ]

                   indiscretion--

                              virginia
                   seven.

                               fletcher
                   hm?

          

                              virginia
                   seven single acts of
                   indiscretion.

                               fletcher
                   --seven acts of indiscretion,
                   only one of which he has any
                   evidence of, and all of which
                   he himself is responsible, for.

                              virginia
                   he is?

          

                     fletcher
          mrs. cole, i stayed up all
          night last night studying your
          c ase. not just your case...
          b ut you. and, by now, i feel
          i know you. you are the
          victim here. the wife of a
          cold, distant businessman.
          starved for affection, driven
          into the arms of another man--

                     virginia
          seven.

                     fletcher
                (not missing a

                 beat)
          --seven .other men. you're not
          trying to deny him what is
          r ig htf ull y his. all you're
          insisting on is what is
          r ig htf ull y yours. and maybe
          an idgy-smidgy bit more. i
          think you're bending over
          backwards.

                     virginia
          well, i did agree to give him
          j oint custody of the kids...
                (to miranda)
          he's always been a good
          father.

                     fletcher
          and you've always been a good
          wife.

                       virginia
                  (getting worked

                   up)
          yeah. . .

                     fletcher
          there's such a thing as being
          t oo nice. that's why you need
          aggr essive representation. to
          show the court that there is
          more than one side to this
          st ory. all i'm asking is the
          opportunity to see that
          justice is done on your
          behalf.
                (takes her hand)
          will you give me that
          opportunity?

          
          he stares into her eyes. a moment, then...

                                 virginia
                    yes! i ' m tired of getting
                    kicked around.

                              fletcher
                    good for you!

                                 virginia
                    thank you, mr. reid. i ' m so
                    grateful i have an attorney i
                    can trust.
          s he gives him a hug and momentarily grabs his ass. with a
          farewell nod to miranda, she leaves.
          miranda turns, smiles at fletcher, then shuts the door.
          she moves in on him.

                                 miranda
                    you're good. you're really
                    good.

                                 fletcher
                    oh, pshaw.
                         (pronounces it
                          with the "p")
          she picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.

                                 miranda
                   n o, i mean it. the cole case
                   is worth a truckload of money
                   to this firm, not to mention
                   the press it's going to
                   g en er at e . you win this case
                   and i guarantee you'll make
                   partner.

                           (straightening
                            his tie)
                   actually, how would you like
                   to make a partner right now?

                                 fletcher
                    excuse me?
          she grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep kiss.

          man in a clown suit and clown make-up.

          he flops down on his back causing something in his pants to
          honk. audrey and jerry watch.

                    well, if you don't hire your
