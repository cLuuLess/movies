          int. audrey and max's dining room - night

          we pan down from banners reading happy birthday, max!. . . to
          a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.
          audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

                              audrey
                    all right, birthday boy, make
                    a wish.
          max doesn't respond.

                              audrey (cont'd)
                    c'mon, honey. it can be
                    anything-- whatever you want
                    most in the world.
          when he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

                              audrey (cont'd)
                    max, your dad is sorry. he
                    had to work.

                               max
                    he said he was coming. he
                    promised.

                               audrey
                    yes, well, he... promises
                    he'll see you tomorrow.
          max doesn't believe it.     <
          he turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   in
          voice over we hear what she does not.

                               max (v.o.)
                    i wish, for just one day, dad
                    couldn't tell a lie.
          he takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. a
          strange wind blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
          up... to the clock on the wall. it's 9:15.

                                                    cut to:
          a clock on a wall.   it's 9:15'. we are--
