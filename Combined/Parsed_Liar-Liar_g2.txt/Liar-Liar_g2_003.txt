          ext. courthouse -- afternoon

          fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow lawyer,

                              lawyer
                    how's it going, fletcher?

                               fletcher
                          (he' s won)
                    another gratifying day serving
                    justice.
          fletcher's huge client catches up to him.

                              client
                    hey great job, mr. reid. i
                    wish there was some way i
                    could show my appreciation.

                              fletcher
                    stay out of my neighborhood
                    after dark.
          a publicist carrying, a clipboard approaches fletcher.

                              publicist
                    mr. reid, do you have a Â·
                    moment-?

                              fletcher
                    no, i'm late picking up my
                    son.

                              publicist
                    -because a couple of reporters
                    want to interview you about
                    your big win today.
          fletcher instantly shifts directions.

                              fletcher    ..
                    how's my hair?
          and he's off to woo a gang of reporters.
