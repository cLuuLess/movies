          fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable. phone

          rings.

                                 fletcher
                    hello.

                              fletcher
                         (summoning up

                          enthusiasm)
                    maxi-pad. how's it going?

                                 fletcher
                   sure.

          

                               max
                    oh boy. we're setting up a
                    whole field in the yard.
                    where we buried petey the
                    hamster is second base.
                         (fletcher sighs)
                    you're still coming right?'

                               fletcher
                          (sees virginia

                           approaching)

          max hangs up.

                               max
                         (to audrey)
                    he's really coming.
          she smiles, but she's worried. .

          courthouse steps

                                                                    ·

          
          virginia approaches with her handsome lover, laurence falk.

                               virginia
                    mr. reid, you remember
                    laurence falk, the man from
                    the tape.

                              falk
                    how are you?

                               fletcher
                    i've slipped into the seventh
                    circle of hell, thank you, and
                    you?
          virginia exchanges an anxious look with falk.

                               virginia
                    shouldn't we go over our
                    testimony?

                               fletcher
                    well, basically the plan is i
                    walk you through the tape step
                    by step, i ask you questions--

                               virginia
                    and we give the explanation
                    you came up with.

          

                                 fletcher
                    exactly.

          

                                falk
                    so all we have to do is lie.
                    sounds simple enough.

                                fletcher
                    do esn't it? and i'll finish
                    up with a dramatic series of
                    questions, something like...
                    "mr. falk, isn't it true that
                    you and mrs. cole have never
                    made lo--"
          but fletcher gags. he can't get the question out.   the
          others look concerned, but he waves them off.

                              flethcer (cont'd)
                    sorry. i'm fine. "mr. falk,
                    isn't it true that you and
                    mrs. cole have never made lo--

                    io-.h

          
          to his horror, he gags again, .unable to form the word.

                                 fletcher
                            (to himself)
                    oh my god! i can't do it! i
                    can't finish the question if i
                    know the answer is a lie!
          at this moment miranda and mr. allan come up the steps.

                                mr. allan
                    don't let me interrupt,
                    fletcher. i just want you to
                    know i'll be observing this
                    a fternoon. miranda insisted i
                    see you in action.
          fletcher shoots a hateful look at miranda. she smiles.

                              mr. allan (cont'd)
                    i'm looking forward to it. go
                    get 'em!

          
          mr. allan and miranda head into the building, leaving
          fletcher more desperate than before.

                                fletcher
                   c'mon! gotta rephrase the
                   question!

          

                                      fletcher
                         respondent calls... lawrence
                         falk.
               fletcher's clears his throat.       here goes...

                                      fletcher
                         mr. falk, do you know my
                         client, virginia cole?

                                      falk
                         yes.

                                      fletcher
                         isn't it true that your
                         relationship with my client is
                         entirely platonic, not?
               the "not" was involuntary.       it takes everyone by surprise.

                                      falk
                         excuse me?

                                     fletcher
                        if i might rephrase your
                        honor.
                              (trying again)
                        is your relationship with my
                        client entirely patonic, not?

          x\

                        client not entirely platonic?

                        my client entirely platonic?
                             (thinks he's got
                               it, beams with

                               confidence)
                        mr. falk, is not your
                        relationship with my client
                        entirely platonic?

                                     falk

                                (confused)
                        no.     i mean, yes.     i think.

                                     fletcher
                        yes, is your relationship with
                        my client not entirely
                        platonic, or yes, is not your
                        relationship with my client

                        what?

          

                               fletcher
                    how 'bout just answering the
                    question you think i'm asking?              '

                    did you not ever make lo--
                          (losing it)

                    you had sex with her everytime

                    you met, didn't you? didn't

                    you?!!
          falk looks shaken as fletcher barrels on, unable to stop

                                fletcher
                          (screaming at

                           him)

                               falk
                          (breaking down)

                    yes, yes,-- it's true! i

                    humped her. brains out! !
          a gasp from the audience. all eyes are on fletcher.

                               fletcher

                          (weakly)
                    no further questions.

                               dana
                    uh...no questions.

                               judge stevens
                          (to fletcher)
                    call your next witness.

                    i have no further witnesses,
                    your honor.
          a murmur erupts from the crowd.

                               judge stevens
                    you have no further
                    witnesses?!

          
          fletcher meekly shakes his head, no.

                              virginia
                         (whispers, to

                          fletcher)
                    what are you doing? call me.

                              fletcher
                         (to virginia)
                    i can't.

                               judge stevens

                   lie . until nine-sixteen
                   tonight, i can't even.ask a
                   question that calls for a lie!
          virginia grabs him by the tie, pulls him close to her face.

                   attorney had a sudden attack
                   of conscience!
          fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something virginia
          said.

                             fletcher
                        (to himself)
                   thirty-one?

                   mr. reid, we're not getting
                   any younger...
          fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of virginia's prenup
          and her passport.

                              judge stevens
                         (he's had it)
                   mr. reid you have presented
                   virtually nothing in the way
                   of evidence and as such i have

          so on this single document,
          you basically lied at every
          opportunity. i'm sure a woman
          as vain as you would also lie
          about her age. it says you
          were born in 1964. what's the
          truth? 1962? '60? how young
          did you try to make yourself?

                     virginia

                (joyfully)
          wrong! i didn't lie to make
          myself younger. i made myself
          older. i was born in 1965!"

          older?

          oh, you bet it does, your
          honor!
               (on a roll)
          my client lied about her age
          because she was only 17 when
          s he got married. which makes
          h er a minor. and in the great
          state of california, no minor

          can enter into a legal

          contract without parental
