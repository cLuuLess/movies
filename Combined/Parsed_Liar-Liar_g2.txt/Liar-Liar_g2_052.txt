                   counselors, are we ready to

                               fletcher
                          (eagerly and a
                           little too

          and a nanny.

                    --   until now.

          
          he collapses into his chair.

          
                          (to falk, with

                           determination)

          he begins to hyperventilate.     virginia turns to falk.

                               virginia
                    wate r! get him water!
          falk hurries into the building as fletcher hacks on.

                    fu-- fu--

                          (slaps him on the

                          back)
                    try to relax! breathe deeply!
          falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to fletcher, who
          downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, screaming
          in pain. -

                               virginia (cont'd)
                   w hat?!   what?!

                    i got him coffee!
          fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning
          h is scalded mouth. the bailiff appears.

                             bailiff
                   judge is taking the bench.
          fletcher's expression turns to terror.
