          int. lax - security area

          fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector.
          fletcher races right by but sets off the alarm.

                              inspector
                    please step through again.

                                fletcher
                   ahhh!! !    damn..;
          fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his rolex
          into a tray.
          he tries again.     it buzzes again!

                              fletcher
                   what? i'tii practically naked!
          a guy in a turban passes over him with a detector wand.

          

                              fletcher
                    it's called a zipper, hodgy...

          
          the wand beeps over fletchers front pocket. he reaches in
          and pulls out the now familiar blue pen...
