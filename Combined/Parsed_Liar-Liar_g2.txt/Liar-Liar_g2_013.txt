          int. hallway of law offices -- afternoon


          
          fletcher strides through the hallway with max, calling out
          greetings to his colleagues.

                              fletcher
                    hey, pete! great tie!        ·.
          max looks at pete, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.

                              fletcher
                    thomas--looks like you're
                    losin' weight.
          thomas glances up from a file. max notes that he's
          corpulent.

                              thomas
                    gained three pounds.

                               fletcher
                         (wedging past

                          him)
                    on you, it works.

                                                                    ·
          fletcher arrives at his office. we meet his secretary, the
          fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary greta.

                               greta '
                    m ax ! what's new?

                              .max
                    well. . . it's my birthday
                    tomo rrow. we're having a
                    party and everything.
          flet cher's eyes widen. he has clearly forgotten.

                              gre ta
                    i'm sure your dad'11 give you
                    something wonderful.
          fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when max
          turns to him.     .

                              max
                    yeah?

                              fletcher
                    oh, yeah. you're going to
                    love it. uh, why don't you
                    play in my office for a
                    minute? fax something, sue
                    someone, have a good time.
                    we'll be leaving in a second.

          
          max heads into the office. fletcher closes the door behind
          him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.

                                fletcher (cont'd)
                    damn!   i completely forgot.

                              greta
                    oh, there's a surprise.
          greta produces a wrapped gift.

                               fletcher
                    you're a saint. i should get
                    you something.

                               greta
                    you did.
          she holds up another, smaller package.

                               fletcher
                    ah. well, i always do the
                    classy thing. any calls?

                                                                       ·
          she hands him a stack of mail.

                               greta
                   . let's see.. .   ·

                          (checking

                           messages)
                    judge patterson's clerk. he
                    needs your filing.

                               fletcher
                    tell him it's in the mail.

                               greta
                          (jotting down a

                           note)
                    right. you'll do it next
                    week. mr. mckinley phoned,
                    questioning that fourteen
                    hours you billed on christinas
                    eve.

                               fletcher
                    write him a long, explanatory
                    letter. then bill him for the
                    letter.

                               greta
                         (jotting down a
                        . note).    ..
                    done. your mother called.

          

                               fletcher
                    i ' m on vacation.

                              greta
                    this is your fifth week.      .   ·   .

                              fletcher
                    it's a long vacation.

                              greta
                         (jotting down a

                          note)
                    "break mother's heart." done.
                    and that's it, except
                    miranda's looking for you.

                               fletcher
                          (checking watch)
                    as if i don't have anything
                    better to do than bow and
                    scrape at her royal perfumed
                    p artner feet. tell her i'm in
                    court.

                              greta
                    court's closed.

                              fletcher
                    tell her i broke my leg and
                    had to be shot.

                              greta

                         (whispers)
                    why don't you tell her
                    yourself?
          as miranda approaches, fletcher switches gears in an

          instant:

                              fletcher
                    --and then send out a notice
                    of judgement on my win today!

                               greta

                         (dry)
                    i'll get right on it.
          fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised.

                              fletcher
                    miranda! i didn't see you.
                    hey, you look lovely, today.
                    here, i bought you a gift.

          
          he grabs greta's gift and hands it to miranda.

                              miranda
                    thanks. i heard about your
                    victory today. you're making
                    quite an impression on the
                    partnership committee.

                              fletcher

                         (feigning

                          puzzlement;

                          then)
                    oh, that's right. you folks
                    are meeting again soon.
                    "allan, stewart, konigsberg,
                    and ried." there's something
                    about the rhythm of fours.
                    it's like a full measure.
                    well, anyway, i've got a
                    client waiting in my office--

                              miranda .
                    actually, something important
                    h as come up. you're not busy
                    tonight, are you?
          before fletcher answers, we:

                                                     cut to:
