               int. barton park - dining room - eve

               close on an empty chair and place setting. pull out to reveal 
               the dashwoods at their first dinner with sir john and mrs 
               jennings.

                                     mrs jennings
                         colonel brandon is the most eligible 
                         bachelor in the county--he is bound 
                         to do for one of you. mind, he is a 
                         better age for miss dashwood--but i 
                         dare say she left her heart behind 
                         in sussex, eh?

               marianne flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern 
               at her sister, which mrs jennings notices.

                                     mrs jennings
                         aha! i see you, miss marianne! i 
                         think i have unearthed a secret!

                                     sir john
                         oho! have you sniffed one out already, 
                         mother? you are worse than my best 
                         pointer, flossie!

               they both laugh immoderately. elinor tries to stay calm.

                                     mrs jennings
                         what sort of man is he, miss dashwood? 
                         is he butcher, baker, candlestick-
                         maker? i shall winkle it out of you 
                         somehow, you know!

                                     sir john
                         she's horribly good at winkling.

                                     mrs jennings
                         you are in lonely country now, miss 
                         dashwood, none of us has any secrets 
                         here--

                                     sir john
                         --or if we do, we do not keep them 
                         for long!

               elinor tries to smile. marianne looks furious. margaret is 
               staring at mrs jennings as if she were some particularly 
               thrilling form of wildlife.

                                     mrs jennings
                         he is curate of the parish, i dare 
                         say!

                                     sir john
                         or a handsome lieutenant!

                                     mrs jennings
                         give us a clue, miss dashwood--is he 
                         in uniform?

               elinor starts to change the subject, but margaret interrupts 
               her.

                                     margaret
                         he has no profession!

               sir john and mrs jennings turn on her with screams of delight. 
               elinor, marianne and mrs dashwood look at each other 
               helplessly.

                                     sir john
                         no profession! a gentleman, then!

                                     marianne
                              (with daggers)
                         margaret, you know perfectly well 
                         there is no such person.

                                     margaret
                         there is! there is! and his name 
                         begins with an f!

               elinor looks hard at her plate.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         margaret!

               mrs dashwood is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a 
               vulgar game. sir john and mrs jennings are cock-a-hoop.

                                     sir john
                         f indeed! a very promising letter. 
                         let me--f, f, fo, fa... upon my word, 
                         but i cannot think of a single name 
                         beginning with f--

                                     mrs jennings
                         forrest? foster? frost? foggarty?

               marianne suddenly stands up. sir john and mrs jennings are 
               so surprised they stop talking. everyone stares at marianne.

                                     marianne
                              (controlled fury)
                         sir john, might i play your 
                         pianoforte?

                                     sir john
                         of course, yes--my goodness. we do 
                         not stand on ceremony here, my dear.

               for once, elinor is grateful for her sister's rudeness as 
               everyone rises and follows marianne out.
