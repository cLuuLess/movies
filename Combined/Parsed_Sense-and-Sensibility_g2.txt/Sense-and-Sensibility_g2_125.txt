               int. the palmers' carriage - on the road - day

               marianne is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed. 
               she does not look well. mr palmer is behind his newspaper.

                                     charlotte
                         what a stroke of luck for lucy and 
                         edward to find a parish so close to 
                         barton! you will all be able to meet 
                         very often. that will cheer you up, 
                         miss marianne. i do declare i have 
                         never disliked a person so much as i 
                         do mr willoughby, for your sake. 
                         insufferable man! to think we can 
                         see his insufferable house from the 
                         top of our hill!

               close on marianne's eyes slowly opening.

                                     charlotte
                         i shall ask jackson to plant some 
                         very tall trees.

                                     mr palmer
                              (from behind the paper)
                         you will do nothing of the sort.
