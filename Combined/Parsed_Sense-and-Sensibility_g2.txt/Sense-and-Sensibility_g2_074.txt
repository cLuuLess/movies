               ext. barton park - drive - day

               people and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the 
               atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. sir john is organising 
               the provision of blankets and parasols and colonel brandon 
               is busy furnishing the drivers with their routes. there are 
               three new faces a pretty, blowsy woman (charlotte palmer), a 
               stony-faced man (mr palmer) and an exceedingly good-looking 
               girl (lucy steele), who are standing with elinor, marianne, 
               margaret, mrs jennings and mrs dashwood.

               marianne is standing slightly apart, looking out along the 
               road, impatient for willoughby.

                                     mrs jennings
                         imagine my surprise, mrs dashwood, 
                         when charlotte and her lord and master 
                         appeared with our cousin lucy! the 
                         last person i expected to see! 'where 
                         did you pop out from, miss?' says i. 
                         i was never so surprised to see anyone 
                         in all my life!

               lucy steele smiles shyly and looks at the ground. mrs jennings 
               continues sotto voce to mrs dashwood.

                                     mrs jennings
                         she probably came on purpose to share 
                         the fun, for there are no funds for 
                         such luxuries at home, poor thing.

                                     lucy
                         i had not seen you for so long, dear 
                         mrs jennings, i could not resist the 
                         opportunity.

                                     charlotte
                         oh, you sly thing! it was the misses 
                         dashwood she wanted to see, not 
                         delaford, mamma! i have heard nothing 
                         but 'miss dashwood this, miss dashwood 
                         that' for i don't know how long! and 
                         what do you think of them now you do 
                         see them, lucy? my mother has talked 
                         of nothing else in her letters since 
                         you came to barton, mrs dashwood. mr 
                         palmer--are they not the very 
                         creatures she describes?

               mr palmer regards his wife with a less than enchanted 
               expression.

                                     mr palmer
                         nothing like.

                                     charlotte
                              (laughing gaily)
                         why, mr palmer! do you know you are 
                         quite rude today? he is to be an mp, 
                         you know, mrs dashwood, and it is 
                         very fatiguing for him for he is 
                         forced to make everybody like him--
                         he says it is quite shocking--

                                     mrs palmer
                         i never said anything so irrational. 
                         don't palm all your abuses of the 
                         language upon me.

                                     mrs jennings
                              (to mrs dashwood)
                         mr palmer is so droll--he is always 
                         out of humour.

               mr palmer does indeed have the air of a man under siege. 
               willough by suddenly appears in his curricle. marianne waves 
               to him with a radiant smile. mrs jennings nudges charlotte 
               and points to marianne.

                                     mrs jennings
                         here he is! now you shall see, 
                         charlotte.

               willoughby drives up as close to marianne as possible, making 
               her laugh.

                                     mrs jennings
                         how now, mr willoughby! you must 
                         greet my daughter charlotte, and mr 
                         palmer--

                                     willoughby
                         how do you do?

                                     mrs jennings
                         and my little cousin, miss lucy 
                         steele.

                                     willoughby
                         welcome to our party, miss steele!

               lucy bobs demurely. willoughby inclines his head politely, 
               leaps from the curricle and hands marianne in. mrs jennings 
               coos and chuckles at them. charlotte nudges elinor.

                                     charlotte
                         i know mr willoughby extremely well--
                         not that i ever spoke to him but i 
                         have seen him forever in town. your 
                         sister is monstrous lucky to get 
                         him. mamma says colonel brandon is 
                         in love with her as well, which is a 
                         very great compliment for he hardly 
                         ever falls in love with anyone.

               elinor smiles politely. willoughby moves the curricle out to 
               the front of the drive. charlotte points after them and laughs 
               with mrs jennings. lucy edges up beside elinor.

                                     lucy
                         may i beg a seat beside you, miss 
                         dashwood? i have so longed to make 
                         your better acquaintance! i have 
                         heard nothing but the highest praise 
                         for you.

               elinor is relieved to change the subject.

                                     elinor
                         i would be delighted. but sir john 
                         and mrs jennings are too excessive 
                         in their compliments. i am sure to 
                         disappoint.

                                     lucy
                         no, for it was from quite another 
                         source that i heard you praised and 
                         one not at all inclined to 
                         exaggeration.

               lucy speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though 
               not wanting anyone else to hear. at that moment a horseman 
               thunders up the drive towards them. everyone turns to face 
               the new arrival.

                                     sir john
                         what can this be?

               it is a messenger who has obviously had a long, hard ride. 
               he asks for colonel brandon and hands him a letter, which 
               brandon tears open. mrs jennings is puce with suppressed 
               curiosity.

                                     colonel brandon
                         my horse! quickly!

                                     sir john
                         what is the matter, brandon?

                                     colonel brandon
                         i must away to london.

                                     sir john
                         no! impossible!

               everyone gathers round brandon, who is, naturally, mortified. 
               a servant brings up the colonel's horse.

                                     colonel brandon
                         imperative.

               there is a murmur of disappointment from the party. sir john 
               is embarrassed and protests again.

                                     sir john
                         but brandon, we are all assembled. 
                         we cannot picnic at delaford without 
                         our host! go up to town tomorrow.

                                     willoughby
                         or wait till we return and start 
                         then--you would not be six hours 
                         later.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i cannot afford to lose one minute.

               as he speaks, he is mounting his horse. his grave urgency 
               silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone 
               stunned and, of course, deeply curious. then they all start 
               to talk at once. lucy is still next to elinor.

                                     lucy
                         oh, miss dashwood, i cannot bear it! 
                         just when i was to have the 
                         opportunity of speaking with you.
