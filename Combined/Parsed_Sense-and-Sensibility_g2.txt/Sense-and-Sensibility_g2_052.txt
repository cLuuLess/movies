               ext. pond near barton park - day

               in the background, sir john, elinor and mrs jennings pack 
               the remains of a picnic into a basket. mrs dashwood and 
               margaret examine a foxhole. in the foreground, marianne is 
               cutting bulrushes for basketwork. her knife is blunt and she 
               saws impatiently.

               colonel brandon materialises at her side and wordlessly offers 
               her his hunting knife. oddly nervous, marianne takes it. she 
               turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease. the 
               colonel's gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet.
