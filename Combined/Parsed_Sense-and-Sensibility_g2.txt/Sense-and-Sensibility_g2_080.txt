               int. barton church - day

               amongst the small congregation listening to the sermon drone 
               on, we see the excited faces of elinor, margaret and mrs 
               dashwood.

                                     margaret
                         do you think he will kneel down when 
                         he asks her?

                                     elinor
                         shhh!

                                     margaret
                              (with satisfaction)
                         they always kneel down.
