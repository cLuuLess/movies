               ext. cleveland - drive - afternoon

               the carriage stands outside the palmer residence, a 
               resplendent affair with a great deal of land. brandon is 
               helping marianne and elinor out of the carriage.

                                     charlotte (v.o.)
                         i am resolved never to mention mr 
                         willoughby's name again, and 
                         furthermore i shall tell everyone i 
                         meet what a good-for nothing he is.

                                     mr palmer (v.o.)
                         be quiet.

               elinor and marianne stand on the steps as the palmers debauch 
               from the carriage amid a welter of servants.

                                     elinor
                              (sotto voce)
                         i do not think she drew breath from 
                         the moment we left london. it is my 
                         fault--i should have found some other 
                         way of getting home.

                                     marianne
                         there was no other way you said so 
                         yourself.

                                     elinor
                         we shall be home soon enough. mamma 
                         will comfort you, dearest.

                                     marianne
                         i am stiff from sitting so long. 
                         will you tell charlotte that i am 
                         going for a stroll? elinor glances 
                         at the sky in concern.

                                     elinor
                         i think it is going to rain.

                                     marianne
                         no, no, it will not rain.

               elinor cannot help but smile at this return of the old 
               marianne.

                                     elinor
                         you always say that and then it always 
                         does.

                                     marianne
                         i will keep to the garden, near the 
                         house.

               marianne walks off. elinor watches her go anxiously.
