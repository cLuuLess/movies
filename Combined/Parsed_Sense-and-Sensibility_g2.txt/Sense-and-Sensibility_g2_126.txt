                         i hear miss grey's bridal gown was 
                         everything of the finest--made in 
                         paris, no less. i should have liked 
                         to see it, although i dare say it 
                         was a sorry affair, scalloped with 
                         ruffles--but what do the french know 
                         about fashion?
