               int. norland park - velvet room - day

               elinor, mrs dashwood and marianne are sitting round a table 
               with a pile of letters. elinor is handing one back to her 
               mother.

                                     elinor
                         too expensive. we do not need four 
                         bedrooms, we can share.

                                     marianne
                         this one, then?

               elinor reads the letter quickly.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, we have only five hundred 
                         pounds a year. i will send out more 
                         inquiries today.

               there is a knock on the door. hesitantly, edward appears.

                                     edward
                         pardon my intrusion, but i believe i 
                         have found what you are looking for.

               marianne and mrs dashwood are puzzled by his elliptical manner 
               but elinor immediately understands and rises, in smiling 
               relief.
