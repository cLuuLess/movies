               int. mrs jennings's house - study - day

               elinor sits alone with her head in her hands. suddenly mrs 
               jennings hustles in looking pleased.

                                     mrs jennings
                         here is someone to cheer you up, 
                         miss dashwood!

               she is followed in by lucy. mrs jennings leaves, busy as 
               ever. lucy plants an expression of ghastly concern on her 
               face.

                                     lucy
                         how is your dear sister, miss 
                         dashwood? poor thing! i must say, i 
                         do not know what i should do if a 
                         man treated me with so little respect.

                                     elinor
                         i hope you are enjoying your stay 
                         with john and fanny, miss steele?

                                     lucy
                         i was never so happy in my entire 
                         life, miss dashwood! i do believe 
                         your sister-in-law has taken quite a 
                         fancy to me. i had to come and tell 
                         you--for you cannot imagine what has 
                         happened!

                                     elinor
                         no, i cannot.

                                     lucy
                         yesterday i was introduced to edward's 
                         mother!

                                     elinor
                         indeed?

                                     lucy
                         and she was a vast deal more than 
                         civil. i have not yet seen edward 
                         but now i feel sure to very soon--

               the maid comes back.

                                     maid
                         there's a mr edward ferrars to see 
                         you, miss dashwood.

               there is a tiny frozen silence.

                                     elinor
                         do ask him to come up.

               elinor quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again. 
               edward is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. as lucy 
               is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only elinor.

                                     edward
                         miss dashwood, how can i--

               but elinor cuts him off.

                                     elinor
                         mr ferrars, what a pleasure to see 
                         you. you... know miss steele, of 
                         course.

               edward turns slowly and encounters lucy's glassy smile. he 
               all but blanches. then bows, and clears his throat.

                                     edward
                         how do you do, miss steele.

                                     lucy
                         i am well, thank you, mr ferrars.

               edward has no notion of what to do or say. he swallows.

                                     elinor
                         do sit down, mr ferrars.

               lucy's eyes are sharp as broken glass. edward remains on his 
               feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.

                                     lucy
                         you must be surprised to find me 
                         here, mr ferrars! i expect you thought 
                         i was at your sister's house.

               this is precisely what edward had thought. he tries to smile 
               but his facial muscles won't work. elinor decides to fetch 
               help.

                                     elinor
                         let me call marianne, mr ferrars. 
                         she would be most disappointed to 
                         miss you.

               elinor goes to the door, thankful to escape, but marianne 
               prevents her by walking in at that moment. despite her 
               anguish, she is very pleased to see edward and embraces him 
               warmly.

                                     marianne
                         edward! i heard your voice! at last 
                         you have found us!

               edward is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets 
               his own confusion.

                                     edward
                         forgive me, marianne, my visit is 
                         shamefully overdue. you are pale. i 
                         hope you have not been unwell?

                                     marianne
                         oh, don't think of me--elinor is 
                         well, you see, that must be enough 
                         for both of us!

               marianne gestures to elinor encouragingly but edward seems 
               unable to look at her.

                                     edward
                         how do you like london, marianne?

                                     marianne
                         not at all. the sight of you is all 
                         the pleasure it has afforded, is 
                         that not so, elinor?

               again, marianne endeavours to ignite the lovers. elinor tries 
               to silence marianne with her eyes but to no avail. marianne 
               puts their coolness down to the presence of lucy, at whom 
               she glances with a none too friendly air.

                                     marianne
                         why have you taken so long to come 
                         and see us?

                                     edward
                         i have been much engaged elsewhere.

                                     marianne
                         engaged elsewhere! but what was that 
                         when there were such friends to be 
                         met?

                                     lucy
                         perhaps, miss marianne, you think 
                         young men never honour their 
                         engagements, little or great.

               elinor is appalled by this remark but marianne does not notice 
               it and turns back to lucy earnestly.

                                     marianne
                         no, indeed--for edward is the most 
                         fearful of giving pain and the most 
                         incapable of being selfish of anyone 
                         i ever saw.

               edward makes an uncomfortable noise.

                                     marianne
                         edward, will you not sit? elinor, 
                         help me to persuade him.

               now edward can stand it no longer.

                                     edward
                         forgive me but i must take my leave--

                                     marianne
                         but you are only just arrived!

               elinor rises, desperate for them both to go.

                                     edward
                         you must excuse me, i have a 
                         commission to attend to for fanny--

               lucy jumps in like a shot.

                                     lucy
                         in that case perhaps you might escort 
                         me back to your sister's house, mr 
                         ferrars?

               there is an extremely awkward pause.

                                     edward
                         i would be honoured. goodbye, miss 
                         dashwood, miss marianne.

               he shakes hands with elinor and with marianne, who is silent 
               with dismay. lucy takes edward's arm and looks up at him 
               proprietorially.

               after a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from edward, they 
               leave. marianne looks at her sister in astonishment.

                                     marianne
                         why did you not urge him to stay?

                                     elinor
                         he must have had his reasons for 
                         going.

                                     marianne
                         his reason was no doubt your coldness. 
                         if i were edward i would assume you 
                         did not care for me at all.
