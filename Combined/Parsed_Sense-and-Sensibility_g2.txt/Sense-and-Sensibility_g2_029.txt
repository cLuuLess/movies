               ext. norland park - gardens - day

               edward and elinor are still talking as they walk arm in arm 
               in the late afternoon sun.

                                     edward
                         all i want--all i have ever wanted 
                         is the quiet of a private life but 
                         my mother is determined to see me 
                         distinguished.

                                     elinor
                         as?

                                     edward
                         she hardly knows. any fine figure 
                         will suit a great orator, a leading 
                         politician, even a barrister would 
                         serve, but only on the condition 
                         that i drive my own barouche and 
                         dine in the first circles.

               his tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to 
               it.

                                     elinor
                         and what do you wish for?

                                     edward
                         i always preferred the church, but 
                         that is not smart enough for my mother 
                         she prefers the army, but that is a 
                         great deal too smart for me.

                                     elinor
                         would you stay in london?

                                     edward
                         i hate london. no peace. a country 
                         living is my ideal a small parish 
                         where i might do some good, keep 
                         chickens and give very short sermons.
