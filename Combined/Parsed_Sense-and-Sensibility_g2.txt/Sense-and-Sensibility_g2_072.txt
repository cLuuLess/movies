               mrs jennings is talking to the elderly curate. other 
               parishioners exit the church as willoughby's curricle (the 
               eighteenth-century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying 
               by. marianne sits by his side, the picture of happiness. mrs 
               jennings nudges the curate and whispers. the parishioners 
               stare after them and comment to each other.
