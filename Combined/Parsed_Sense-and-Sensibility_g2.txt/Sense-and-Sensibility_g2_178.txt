               ext. barton cottage - garden - day

               margaret is up her tree. elinor is pulling weeds. mrs dashwood 
               is sitting on a stool working on margaret's dress and 
               listening to the strains of the new song which marianne is 
               singing in the cottage. all of a sudden, mrs dashwood rises, 
               shielding her eyes with her hand. she walks down to the gate, 
               looking out.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         here is colonel brandon! marianne!

               the piano stops. marianne comes out and they all gather at 
               the gate to watch for the rider.
