               int. cleveland - drawing room - day

               elinor enters to find charlotte alone with the now hysterical 
               baby thomas.

                                     charlotte
                         there you are, miss dashwood! mr 
                         palmer and the colonel have locked 
                         themselves up in the billiard room. 
                         come and meet little thomas. where 
                         is miss marianne?

                                     elinor
                         she is taking a little air in the 
                         garden.

                                     charlotte
                         oh, very good. that is the great 
                         advantage of the countryside--all 
                         the fresh air and... and all the 
                         fresh air...

               charlotte's conversational difficulties are drowned out by 
               her offspring.
