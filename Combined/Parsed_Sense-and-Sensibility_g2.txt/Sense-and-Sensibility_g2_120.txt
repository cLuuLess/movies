               int. mrs jennings's house - bedroom - day

               elinor and marianne are packing. their mood is gloomy and 
               uncommunicative. mrs jennings explodes into the room fighting 
               for breath.

                                     mrs jennings
                         oh, my dears! what a commotion! mr 
                         edward ferrars--the very one i used 
                         to joke you about, miss dashwood--
                         has been engaged these five years to 
                         lucy steele!

               marianne lets out a gasp. she looks at elinor, who nods at 
               her in swift confirmation.

                                     mrs jennings
                         poor mr ferrars! his mother, who by 
                         all accounts is very proud, demanded 
                         that he break the engagement on pain 
                         of disinheritance. but he has refused 
                         to break his promise to lucy. he has 
                         stood by her, good man, and is cut 
                         off without a penny! she has settled 
                         it all irrevocably upon mr robert. 
                         but i cannot stop, i must go to lucy. 
                         your sister-in-law scolded her like 
                         any fury--drove her to hysterics.

               she leaves the room, still rabbiting on. there is a silence.

                                     marianne
                         how long have you known?

                                     elinor
                         since the evening mrs jennings offered 
                         to take us to london.

                                     marianne
                         why did you not tell me?

                                     elinor
                         lucy told me in the strictest 
                         confidence.

               marianne looks at her in complete incredulity.

                                     elinor
                         i could not break my word.

               clearly, there is no arguing this point.

                                     marianne
                         but edward loves you.

                                     elinor
                         he made me no promises. he tried to 
                         tell me about lucy.

                                     marianne
                         he cannot marry her.

                                     elinor
                         would you have him treat her even 
                         worse than willoughby has treated 
                         you?

                                     marianne
                         no--but nor would i have him marry 
                         where he does not love.

               elinor tries hard to be controlled.

                                     elinor
                         edward made his promise a long time 
                         ago, long before he met me. though 
                         he may... harbour some regret, i 
                         believe he will be happy--in the 
                         knowledge that he did his duty and 
                         kept his word. after all--after all 
                         that is bewitching in the idea of 
                         one's happiness depending entirely 
                         on one person, it is not always 
                         possible. we must accept. edward 
                         will marry lucy--and you and i will 
                         go home.

                                     marianne
                         always resignation and acceptance! 
                         always prudence and honour and duty! 
                         elinor, where is your heart?

               elinor finally explodes. she turns upon marianne almost 
               savagely.

                                     elinor
                         what do you know of my heart? what 
                         do you know of anything but your own 
                         suffering? for weeks, marianne, i 
                         have had this pressing on me without 
                         being at liberty to speak of it to a 
                         single creature. it was forced upon 
                         me by the very person whose prior 
                         claims ruined all my hopes. i have 
                         had to endure her exultation again 
                         and again while knowing myself to be 
                         divided from edward forever. believe 
                         me, marianne, had i not been bound 
                         to silence i could have produced 
                         proof enough of a broken heart even 
                         for you.

               complete silence. then marianne speaks in a whisper.

                                     marianne
                         oh, elinor!

               marianne bursts into sobs and flings her arms around elinor, 
               who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.
