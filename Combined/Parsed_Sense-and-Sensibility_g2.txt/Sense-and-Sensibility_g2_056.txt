               int. barton cottage - parlour - late afternoon

               the dashwoods returning. marianne is taking her bonnet off 
               so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and 
               tighter. despite them selves, elinor and mrs dashwood are 
               amused.

                                     marianne
                         oh! are we never to have a moment's 
                         peace? the rent here may be low but 
                         i think we have it on very hard terms.

                                     elinor
                         mrs jennings is a wealthy woman with 
                         a married daughter--she has nothing 
                         to do but marry off everyone else's.

               betsy pokes her head out from the dining room.

                                     betsy
                         there's a parcel arrived for you, 
                         miss dashwood!

                                     margaret
                         a parcel!

               they all crowd into the dining room to find a large package 
               on the table, which margaret is permitted to open. in the 
               meantime elinor comes to the rescue with the bonnet and 
               marianne stands shifting like a spirited mare as elinor 
               patiently unravels the knot.

                                     marianne
                         it is too ridiculous! when is a man 
                         to be safe from such wit if age and 
                         infirmity do not protect him?

                                     elinor
                         infirmity!

                                     mrs dashwood
                         if colonel brandon is infirm, then i 
                         am at death's door.

                                     elinor
                         it is a miracle your life has extended 
                         this far...

                                     marianne
                         did you not hear him complain of a 
                         rheumatism in his shoulder?

                                     elinor
                         a slight ache' i believe was his 
                         phrase...

               marianne smiles and elinor laughs at her. then margaret opens 
               the parcel to reveal--her atlas. the atmosphere alters 
               immediately as mrs dashwood and marianne look at elinor in 
               consternation.

                                     margaret
                         but edward said he would bring it 
                         himself.

               there is a letter on top of the atlas. close on the address 
               'to the dashwoods'. mrs dashwood picks it up, looks at elinor, 
               and opens

                                     mrs dashwood
                         'dear mrs dashwood, miss dashwood, 
                         miss marianne and captain margaret--
                         it gives me great pleasure to restore 
                         this atlas to its rightful owner. 
                         alas, business in london does not 
                         permit me to accompany it, although 
                         this is likely to hurt me far more 
                         than it hurts you. for the present 
                         my memories of your kindness must be 
                         enough to sustain me, and i remain 
                         your devoted servant always. e. c. 
                         ferrars.'

               a silence greets this brief epistle. elinor struggles to 
               contain her bitter disappointment.

                                     margaret
                         but why hasn't he come?

                                     mrs dashwood
                         he says he is busy, dear.

                                     margaret
                         he said he'd come.

               margaret is genuinely upset. elinor quietly hangs up 
               marianne's bonnet.

                                     margaret
                         why hasn't he come?

               mrs dashwood looks beseechingly at marianne, who nods and 
               grasps margaret's hand.

                                     marianne
                         i am taking you for a walk.

                                     margaret
                         no! i've been a walk.

                                     marianne
                         you need another.

                                     margaret
                         it is going to rain.

               marianne shoves her bonnet back on and drags margaret out.

                                     marianne
                         it is not going to rain.

                                     margaret
                         you always say that and then it always 
                         does.

               we hear the front door slam behind them. there is a short 
               silence.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         i fear mrs jennings is a bad 
                         influence.

               she approaches elinor.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         you must miss him, elinor.

               elinor looks very directly at her mother.

                                     elinor
                         we are not engaged, mamma.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         but he loves you, dearest, of that i 
                         am certain.

               elinor looks down. she speaks slowly, choosing her words 
               with care.

                                     elinor
                         i am by no means assured of his regard 
                         for me.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         oh, elinor!

                                     elinor
                         but even were he to feel such a... 
                         preference, i think we should be 
                         foolish to assume that there would 
                         not be many obstacles to his choosing 
                         a woman of no rank who cannot afford 
                         to buy sugar...

                                     mrs dashwood
                         but elinor--your heart must tell you--

                                     elinor
                         in such a situation, mamma, it is 
                         perhaps better to use one's head.

               she clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the 
               accounts book and opens it. mrs dashwood is silenced.
