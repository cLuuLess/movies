               margaret is standing on the kitchen table while elinor and 
               marianne pin a piece of material around the bottom of her 
               skirt to lengthen it.

               suddenly there is a commotion upstairs.

                                     mrs dashwood (v.o.)
                         marianne! marianne! come and see 
                         what is coming!

               everyone runs out of the kitchen.
