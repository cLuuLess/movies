               int. john and fanny's carriage - day

               john and fanny are on their way out of london.

                                     john
                         fifteen hundred then. what say you 
                         to fifteen hundred?

                                     fanny
                         what brother on earth would do half 
                         so much for his real sisters--let 
                         alone half-blood?

                                     john
                         they can hardly expect more.

                                     fanny
                         there is no knowing what they expect. 
                         the question is, what can you afford?
