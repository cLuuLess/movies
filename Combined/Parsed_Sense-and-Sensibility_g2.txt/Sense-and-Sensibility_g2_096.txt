               int. mrs jennings's house - hall - day

               they enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of 
               a powdered footman (mr pigeon). elinor is haggard after two 
               days of close proximity with lucy. mrs jennings is all 
               officious bustle and marianne is feverish with anticipation. 
               she whispers to mrs jennings, who laughs heartily.

                                     mrs jennings
                         to be sure, my dear, you must just 
                         hand it to pigeon there. he will 
                         take care of it.

               marianne hands a letter to the sphinx-like footman. we can 
               see a large w in the address. elinor looks at marianne 
               inquiringly but marianne moves away from her.

                                     mrs jennings
                         lord above, you do not waste any 
                         time, miss marianne!

               marianne glances self-consciously at elinor and follows mrs 
               jennings upstairs. lucy goes up to elinor and whispers.

                                     lucy
                         a letter! so they are definitely 
                         engaged! mrs jennings says your sister 
                         will buy her wedding clothes here in 
                         town.

                                     elinor
                         indeed miss steele, i know of no 
                         such plan.

               but elinor does not know what else to say. she marches firmly 
               upstairs.
