               ext. barton cottage - garden path - day

               as the exhausted dashwoods alight, they converge with a ruddy- 
               complexioned man in a redingote (sir john middleton) and a 
               rotund, equally roseate lady (mrs jennings) who have fallen 
               over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         sir john!

               sir john clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, 
               followed by elinor, marianne and margaret, who is clearly 
               fascinated by his bouncy companion.

                                     sir john
                         dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my 
                         word, here you are, here you are, 
                         here you are!

                                     mrs dashwood
                         sir john, your extraordinary kindness--

                                     sir john
                         oh, none of that, hush, please, none 
                         of that, but here is my dear mamma-
                         in-law mrs jennings.

                                     mrs jennings
                         was the journey tolerable, you poor 
                         souls?

                                     sir john
                         why did you not come up to the park 
                         first and take your ease? we saw you 
                         pass--like many people who live rather 
                         lonely lives together.

               sir john and mrs jennings talk incessantly, interrupt each 
               other all the time and never listen.

                                     mrs jennings
                         --but i would not wait for you to 
                         come to us, i made john call for the 
                         carriage--

                                     sir john
                         she would not wait, you know.

                                     mrs jennings
                         --as we get so little company.

               they reach the front door and betsy's smiling welcome. in 
               the confusion of milling people and thomas carrying the 
               lighter luggage, marianne contrives to slip into the house 
               alone. we follow her but hear the conversation continuing in 
               v.o. marianne looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire 
               is smoking. she starts up the stairs, expressionless.

                                     mrs jennings (v.o.)
                         but i feel as if i know you already--
                         delightful creatures!

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         delightful! and you know you are to 
                         dine at barton park every day.

                                     mrs dashwood (v.o.)
                         oh, but dear sir john, we cannot--

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         oh, no no no no no no no, i shall 
                         not brook refusals. i am quite deaf 
                         to 'em, you know--

                                     mrs jennings (v.o.)
                         --deaf--

               marianne enters a small bedroom. she sits on the bed. then 
               she goes to the window and opens it. voices float up.

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         but i insist!

                                     elinor (v.o.)
                         let us only settle in for a few days, 
                         sir john, and thank you--

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         oh, no thankings, no, please, can't 
                         bear 'em, embarrassing, you know--

               marianne closes the window and crosses the corridor to another 
               bed room--similarly stark. she sighs and turns back down the 
               stairs.

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         we will send game and fruit as a 
                         matter of course--

                                     mrs jennings (v.o.)
                         --fruit and game--

                                     sir john (v.o.)
                         --and the carriage is at your beck 
                         and call--

               marianne joins the group, who are now in the parlour.

                                     mrs jennings
                         --call--and here is miss marianne!

                                     sir john
                         where did you disappear to?

                                     mrs jennings
                         i declare you are the loveliest girl 
                         i ever set eyes on! cannot you get 
                         them married, mrs dashwood? you must 
                         not leave it too long!

                                     sir john
                         but, alas, there are no smart young 
                         men hereabouts to woo them--

                                     mrs jennings
                         --not a beau for miles!

               the strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to 
               tell on mrs dashwood who is sagging visibly.

                                     sir john
                         come, mother, let us leave them in 
                         peace.

                                     mrs jennings
                         but there is colonel brandon!

               sir john is dragging her down the path.

                                     sir john
                         excellent fellow! we served in the 
                         east india regiment together.

                                     mrs jennings
                         just wait till he sees you! if we 
                         can persuade him out to meet you!

                                     sir john
                         reclusive individual. but you are 
                         fatigued. i can see that you are 
                         fatigued.

               now he is pushing her into the carriage.

                                     mrs jennings
                         of course she is fatigued!

                                     sir john
                         come along, mother, we really must 
                         leave them to themselves.

                                     mrs jennings
                         you must get your maidservant to 
                         make you up some camphor--it is the 
                         best tonic for the staggers!

                                     sir john
                         send thomas to us for the carriage 
                         when you are ready!

               they take off, waving wildly. margaret goes down the path to 
               watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.

                                     margaret
                         i like them.

                                     mrs dashwood
                              (weakly)
                         what generosity.

                                     elinor
                         indeed. i am surprised they did not 
                         offer us their clothing.
