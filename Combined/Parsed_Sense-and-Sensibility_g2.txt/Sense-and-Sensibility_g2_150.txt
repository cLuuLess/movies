               charlotte is getting into their carriage with mrs bunting 
               and baby thomas. mr palmer is on the steps with elinor. he 
               takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy.

                                     mr palmer
                         my dear miss dashwood, i am more 
                         sorry than i can say. if you would 
                         prefer me to stay i am at your 
                         service.

               elinor is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty 
               exterior.

                                     elinor
                         mr palmer, that is very kind. but 
                         colonel brandon and dr harris will 
                         look after us. thank you for 
                         everything you have done.

               mr palmer nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps 
               to the carriage.
