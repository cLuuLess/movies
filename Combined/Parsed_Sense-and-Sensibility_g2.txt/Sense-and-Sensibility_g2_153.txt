               int. cleveland - upstairs corridor - day

               elinor exits the bedroom to find brandon outside. she jumps.

                                     colonel brandon
                         what can i do?

                                     elinor
                         colonel, you have done so much 
                         already.

                                     colonel brandon
                         give me an occupation, miss dashwood, 
                         or i shall run mad. he is dangerously 
                         quiet.

                                     elinor
                         she would be easier if her mother 
                         were here.

                                     colonel brandon
                         of course. barton is but eight hours 
                         away. if i make no stop, you may see 
                         us early tomorrow morning.

               he takes elinor's hand and kisses it.

                                     colonel brandon
                         in your hands i know she will be 
                         safe.
