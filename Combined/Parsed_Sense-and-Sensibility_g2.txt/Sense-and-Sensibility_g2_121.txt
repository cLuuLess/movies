               ext. palmer residence - london street - day

               lucy and mrs jennings are on the doorstep. lucy looks rather 
               lost and pathetic, with her little bundles, hastily packed. 
               the door opens and charlotte precedes the servant, ushering 
               them in with shrill cries of sympathy.

                         i have heard that your friend mr 
                         ferrars has been entirely cast off 
                         by his family for persevering in his 
                         engagement to miss steele.
