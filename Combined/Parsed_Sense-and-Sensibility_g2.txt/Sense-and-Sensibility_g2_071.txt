               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               elinor and mrs dashwood are at the accounts. willoughby and 
               marianne are on the other side of the room in the window 
               seat, whispering together. clearly, he is already part of 
               the family.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         surely you are not going to deny us 
                         beef as well as sugar?

                                     elinor
                         there is nothing under tenpence a 
                         pound. we have to economise.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         do you want us to starve?

                                     elinor
                         no. just not to eat beef.

               mrs dashwood is silenced but sighs crossly. elinor looks 
               over to the lovers and sees willoughby in the act of cutting 
               off a lock of marianne's hair, which he kisses and places in 
               his pocket-book. elinor is transfixed by this strangely erotic 
               moment. willoughby senses her gaze and looks over. she snaps 
               her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she 
               has written 'edward' at the top of the sheet. hastily she 
               rubs it out and writes 'expenses'.
