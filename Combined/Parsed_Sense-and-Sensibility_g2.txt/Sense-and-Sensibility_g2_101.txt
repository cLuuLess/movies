               int. mrs jennings's house - morning room - night

               marianne, in her nightclothes and dressing gown, paces 
               restlessly, her letter in her hands. a slight knock at the 
               door heralds a much-ruffled pigeon, wig askew. marianne hands 
               him the letter. he bows and goes, highly disgruntled.
