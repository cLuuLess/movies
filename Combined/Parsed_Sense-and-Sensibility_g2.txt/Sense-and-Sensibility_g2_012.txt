               int. john and fanny's carriage - day

               john and fanny joggle on.

                                     john
                         twenty pounds now and then will amply 
                         discharge my promise, you are quite 
                         right.

                                     fanny
                         indeed. although to say the truth, i 
                         am convinced within myself that your 
                         father had no idea of your giving 
                         them money.

                                     john
                         they will have five hundred a year 
                         amongst them as it is--

                                     fanny
                         --and what on earth can four women 
                         want for more than that? their 
                         housekeeping will be nothing at all 
                         they will have no carriage, no horses, 
                         hardly any servants and will keep no 
                         company. only conceive how comfortable 
                         they will be!
