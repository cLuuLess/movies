                         they are all exceedingly spoilt, i 
                         find. miss margaret spends all her 
                         time up trees and under furniture 
                         and i have barely had a civil word 
                         from marianne.

                                     edward
                         my dear fanny, they have just lost 
                         their father their lives will never 
                         be the same again.

                                     fanny
                         that is no excuse.
