               int. mrs jennings's carriage - road to london - day

               mrs jennings is chattering about london to marianne, who 
               listens with new-found tolerance. lucy is whispering into 
               elinor's ear.

                                     lucy
                         i have written to edward, miss 
                         dashwood, and yet i do not know how 
                         much i may see of him. secrecy is 
                         vital--he will never be able to call.

                                     elinor
                         i should imagine not.

                                     lucy
                         it is so hard. i believe my only 
                         comfort has been the constancy of 
                         his affection.

                                     elinor
                         you are fortunate, over such a lengthy 
                         engagement, never to have had any 
                         doubts on that score.

               lucy looks at elinor sharply, but elinor is impassive.

                                     lucy
                         oh! i am of rather a jealous nature 
                         and if he had talked more of one 
                         young lady than any other... but he 
                         has never given a moment's alarm on 
                         that count.

               we can see from elinor's expression that she understands 
               lucy perfectly. the strain around her eyes is pronounced.

                                     lucy
                         imagine how glad he will be to learn 
                         that we are friends!
