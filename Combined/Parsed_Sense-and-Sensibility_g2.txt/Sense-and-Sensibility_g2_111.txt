               int. mrs jennings's house - drawing room - day

               elinor is seated at a desk writing a letter. there is a sudden 
               rap at the front door. footsteps are heard and as she turns, 
               the maid enters with colonel brandon. elinor rises to greet 
               him.

                                     elinor
                         thank you for coming, colonel.

               he bows. elinor is on edge. brandon looks haggard with 
               concern.

                                     colonel brandon
                         how does your sister?

                                     elinor
                         i must get her home as quickly as 
                         possible. the palmers can take us as 
                         far as cleveland, which is but a day 
                         from barton--

                                     colonel brandon
                         then permit me to accompany you and 
                         take you straight on from cleveland 
                         to barton myself.

               elinor takes his hands gratefully.

                                     elinor
                         i confess that is precisely what i 
                         had hoped for. marianne suffers 
                         cruelly, and what pains me most is 
                         how hard she tries to justify mr 
                         willoughby. but you know her 
                         disposition.

               after a moment brandon nods. he seems unable to remain still 
               or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking.

                                     colonel brandon
                         perhaps i--my regard for you all--
                         miss dashwood, will you allow me to 
                         prove it by relating some 
                         circumstances which nothing but an 
                         earnest desire of being useful--

                                     elinor
                         you have something to tell me of mr 
                         willoughby.

                                     colonel brandon
                              (nods)
                         when i quitted barton last--but i 
                         must go further back. a short account 
                         of myself will be necessary. no 
                         doubt... no doubt mrs jennings has 
                         apprised you of certain events in my 
                         past--the sad outcome of my connection 
                         with a young woman named eliza.

               elinor nods.

                                     colonel brandon
                         what is not commonly known is that 
                         twenty years ago, eliza bore an 
                         illegitimate child. the father, 
                         whoever he was, abandoned them.

               this is strong stuff. elinor's concern deepens.

                                     colonel brandon
                         as she lay dying, she begged me to 
                         look after the child. eliza died in 
                         my arms, broken, wasted away--ah! 
                         miss dashwood, such a subject--
                         untouched for so many years--it is 
                         dangerous...

               he paces about, barely able to conceal his distress.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i had failed eliza in every other 
                         way--i could not refuse her now. i 
                         took the child--beth is her name--
                         and placed her with a family where i 
                         could be sure she would be well looked 
                         after. i saw her whenever i could. i 
                         saw that she was headstrong like her 
                         mother--and, god forgive me, i 
                         indulged her, i allowed her too much 
                         freedom. almost a year ago, she 
                         disappeared.

                                     elinor
                         disappeared!

                                     colonel brandon
                         i instigated a search but for eight 
                         months i was left to imagine the 
                         worst. at last, on the day of the 
                         delaford picnic, i received the first 
                         news her. she was with child... and 
                         the blackguard who had--

               brandon stops and looks straight at elinor.

                                     elinor
                         good god. do you mean--willoughby?

               brandon nods. elinor drops into a chair, utterly shocked.

                                     colonel brandon
                         before i could return to confront 
                         him, lady allen learned of his 
                         behaviour and turned him from the 
                         house. he beat a hasty retreat to 
                         london--

                                     elinor
                         yes! he left us that morning, without 
                         any explanation!

                                     colonel brandon
                         lady allen had annulled his legacy. 
                         he was left with next to nothing, 
                         and in danger of losing all that 
                         remained to his debtors--

                                     elinor
                         --and so abandoned marianne for miss 
                         grey and her fifty thousand pounds.

               brandon is silent. elinor is breathless.

                                     elinor
                         have you seen mr willoughby since 
                         you learned...?

                                     brandon
                              (nodding)
                         we met by appointment, he to defend, 
                         i to punish his conduct.

               elinor stares at him, aghast.

                                     brandon
                         we returned unwounded, so the meeting 
                         never got abroad.

               elinor nods and is silent for a moment.

                                     elinor
                         is beth still in town?

                                     colonel brandon
                         she has chosen to go into the country 
                         for her confinement. such has been 
                         the unhappy resemblance between the 
                         fate of mother and daughter, and so 
                         imperfectly have i discharged my 
                         trust.

               a pause.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i would not have burdened you, miss 
                         dashwood, had i not from my heart 
                         believed it might, in time, lessen 
                         your sister's regrets.

               brandon moves to the door and then stops. he turns to her 
               and speaks with effort.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i have described mr willoughby as 
                         the worst of libertines--but i have 
                         since learned from lady allen that 
                         he did mean to propose that day. 
                         therefore i cannot deny that his 
                         intentions towards marianne were 
                         honourable, and i feel certain he 
                         would have married her, had it not 
                         been for--for the money.

               she looks up at brandon. silence.
