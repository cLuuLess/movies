               edward walks in loudly.

                                     edward
                         oh, miss dashwood! excuse me i was 
                         wondering do you by any chance have 
                         such a thing as a reliable atlas?

               elinor looks up at him in astonishment.

                                     elinor
                         i believe so.

                                     edward
                         excellent. i wish to check the 
                         position of the nile.

               edward appears to be utterly sincere.

                                     edward
                         my sister says it is in south america.

               from under the table we hear a snort. elinor looks at him in 
               realisation.

                                     elinor
                         oh! no, no indeed. she is quite wrong. 
                         for i believe it is in--in belgium.

                                     edward
                         belgium? surely not. you must be 
                         thinking of the volga.

                                     margaret
                              (from under the table)
                         the volga?

                                     elinor
                         of course. the volga, which, as you 
                         know, starts in...

                                     edward
                         vladivostok, and ends in...

                                     elinor
                         st albans.

                                     edward
                         indeed. where the coffee beans come 
                         from.

               they are having such a good time that it is rather a pity 
               the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table 
               of margaret who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of 
               eleven. she hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of 
               edward.

                                     margaret
                         the source of the nile is in 
                         abyssinia.

                                     edward
                         is it? good heavens. how do you do. 
                         edward ferrars.

                                     margaret
                         margaret dashwood.

               edward shakes margaret's hand solemnly and looks over her 
               head at elinor. they smile at each other, a connection made.
