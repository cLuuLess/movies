               int. barton cottage - front door - day

               they all enter the cottage, talking nonsense loudly in order 
               to signal their presence. margaret giggles. suddenly, marianne 
               bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the 
               room opposite. elinor and margaret stand by the door in utter 
               consternation, while mrs dash- wood goes to marianne.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         what is wrong, my dearest?

               marianne shakes her head and waves them away.
