               int. barton cottage - parlour - day

               elinor cannot stop crying. edward comes forward, very slowly.

                                     edward
                         elinor! i met lucy when i was very 
                         young. had i had an active profession, 
                         i should never have felt such an 
                         idle, foolish inclination. at norland 
                         my behaviour was very wrong. but i 
                         convinced myself you felt only 
                         friendship for me and it was my heart 
                         alone that i was risking. i have 
                         come with no expectations. only to 
                         profess, now that i am at liberty to 
                         do so, that my heart is and always 
                         will be yours.

               elinor looks at him, her face streaked with tears of released 
               emotion, of pain and of happiness.
