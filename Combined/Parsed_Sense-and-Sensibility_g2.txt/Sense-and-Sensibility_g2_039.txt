               ext. road to and from barton cottage - day

               in comparison to norland, barton cottage has the air of a 
               damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely 
               countryside.

               from one side we can see the dashwoods' carriage drawing up 
               at the gate. from the other, a much grander vehicle, from 
               which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.
