               int. norland park - velvet room - another day

               edward comes into the doorway and sees elinor who is listening 
               to marianne playing a concerto. elinor stands in a graceful, 
               rather sad attitude, her back to us. suddenly she senses 
               edward behind her and turns. he is about to turn away, 
               embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees 
               she has been weeping. hastily she tries to dry her eyes. he 
               comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes 
               with a grateful smile. we notice his monogram in the corner: 
               ecf.

                                     elinor
                              (apologetic)
                         that was my father's favourite.

               edward nods kindly.

                                     elinor
                         thank you so much for your help with 
                         margaret, mr ferrars. she is a changed 
                         girl since your arrival.

                                     edward
                         not at all. i enjoy her company.

                                     elinor
                         has she shown you her tree-house?

                                     edward
                         not yet. would you do me the honour, 
                         miss dashwood? it is very fine out.

                                     elinor
                         with pleasure.

               they start to walk out of shot, still talking.

                                     elinor
                         margaret has always wanted to travel.

                                     edward
                         i know. she is heading an expedition 
                         to china shortly. i am to go as her 
                         servant but only on the understanding 
                         that i will be very badly treated.

                                     elinor
                         what will your duties be?

                                     edward
                         sword-fighting, administering rum 
                         and swabbing.

                                     elinor
                         ah.

               cam tilts up to find mrs dashwood on the middle landing of 
               the staircase, smiling down at them. cam tilts up yet further 
               to find fanny on the landing above, watching edward and elinor 
               with a face like a prune.
