               int. cleveland - elinor and marianne's bedroom - morning

               dr harris sits slumped in a chair. marianne lies motionless. 
               elinor rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to 
               the window. she is white as paper. the lark sings. then, 
               from behind, comes the faintest of whispers.

                                     marianne (v.o.)
                         elinor?

               elinor turns with a cry. dr harris springs from his seat and 
               examines marianne. he then turns to elinor with a smile of 
               relief and nods. at that moment the sound of carriage wheels 
               is heard on the gravel.

                                     elinor
                         my mother!
