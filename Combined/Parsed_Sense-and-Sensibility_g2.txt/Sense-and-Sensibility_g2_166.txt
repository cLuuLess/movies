               int. cleveland - elinor and marianne's bedroom - morning

               close on marianne's face as mrs dashwood kisses her.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         there, there, my love, my marianne.

               marianne opens her eyes and smiles at her mother. mrs dashwood 
               takes her gently into her arms. marianne suddenly looks 
               anxious. she is too weak to move her head. she whispers with 
               urgent effort.

                                     marianne
                         where is elinor?

                                     elinor
                         i am here, dearest, i am here.

               marianne looks at her with deep relief. behind the dashwoods, 
               brandon stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this 
               intimacy. he wipes his eyes and turns away. marianne sees 
               and whispers to him.

                                     marianne
                         colonel brandon.

               brandon turns back, his eyes full of tears. marianne looks 
               at him for a moment. then, very quietly:

                                     marianne
                         thank you.
