               int. norland park - drawing room - day

               a beautiful young woman (marianne dashwood) is sitting at 
               the piano playing a particularly sad piece. elinor enters.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, cannot you play something 
                         else? mamma has been weeping since 
                         breakfast.

               marianne stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts 
               playing something equally lugubrious.

                                     elinor
                         i meant something less mournful, 
                         dearest.
