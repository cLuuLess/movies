               int. norland park - elinor's bedroom - night

               elinor is in bed, deep in thought. marianne enters in her 
               nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. she reads, teasingly.

                                     marianne
                         is love a fancy, or a feeling? no it 
                         is immortal as immaculate truth 'tis 
                         not a blossom shed as soon as youth 
                         drops from the stem of life for it 
                         will grow in barren regions, where 
                         no waters flow nor ray of promise 
                         cheats the pensive gloom--

               she jumps onto the bed. elinor smiles somewhat suspiciously.

                                     marianne
                         what a pity it is that edward has no 
                         passion for reading.

                                     elinor
                         it was you who asked him to read and 
                         then you made him nervous.

                                     marianne
                         me?

                                     elinor
                         but your behaviour to him in all 
                         other respects is perfectly cordial 
                         so i must assume that you like him 
                         in spite of his deficiencies.

                                     marianne
                              (trying hard)
                         i think him everything that is amiable 
                         and worthy.

                                     elinor
                         praise indeed!

                                     marianne
                         but he shall have my unanswering 
                         devotion when you tell me he is to 
                         be my brother.

               elinor is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply. 
               suddenly marianne hugs her passionately.

                                     marianne
                         how shall i do without you?

                                     elinor
                         do without me?

               marianne pulls away, her eyes full of tears.

                                     marianne
                         i am sure you will be very happy. 
                         but you must promise not to live too 
                         far away.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, there is no question of 
                         that is, there is no under standing 
                         between...

               elinor trails off. marianne looks at her keenly.

                                     marianne
                         do you love him?

               the bold clarity of this question discomforts elinor.

                                     elinor
                         i do not attempt to deny that i think 
                         very highly of him that i greatly 
                         esteem that i like him.

                                     marianne
                         esteem him! like him! use those 
                         insipid words again and i shall leave 
                         the room this instant!

               this makes elinor laugh in spite of her discomfort.

                                     elinor
                         very well. forgive me. believe my 
                         feelings to be stronger than i have 
                         declared but further than that you 
                         must not believe.

               marianne is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up 
               her book again.

                                     marianne
                         'is love a fancy or a feeling?' or a 
                         ferrars?

                                     elinor
                         go to bed!

               elinor blushes in good earnest. marianne goes to the door.

                                     marianne
                              (imitating elinor)
                         'i do not attempt to deny that i 
                         think highly of him greatly esteem 
                         him! like him!'

               and she is gone, leaving elinor both agitated and amused.
