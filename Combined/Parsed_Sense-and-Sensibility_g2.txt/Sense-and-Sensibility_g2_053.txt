               int. keeper's lodge - barton park - day

               sir john and brandon are cleaning their guns in companionable 
               silence--a habit left over from army days. sir john eyes 
               brandon roguishly.

                                     sir john
                         you know what they're saying, of 
                         course...

               no answer.

                                     sir john
                         the word is that you have developed 
                         a taste for--certain company.

               brandon stays resolutely silent. sir john is emboldened.

                                     sir john
                         and why not, say i. a man like you--
                         in his prime--she'd be a most 
                         fortunate young lady--

               brandon cuts across him.

                                     colonel brandon
                         marianne dashwood would no more think 
                         of me than she would of you, john.

                                     sir john
                         brandon, my boy, do not think of 
                         yourself so meanly--

                                     colonel brandon
                         and all the better for her.

               sir john subsides. brandon is clearly as angry with himself 
               as he is with sir john.
