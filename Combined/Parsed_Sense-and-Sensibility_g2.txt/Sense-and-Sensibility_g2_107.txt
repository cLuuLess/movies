               int. mrs jennings's house - bedroom - day

               elinor finds marianne sitting on the edge of the bed. she 
               does not acknowledge elinor but merely lifts the letter and 
               reads out, with deadly calm:

                                     marianne
                         'my dear madam--i am quite at a loss 
                         to discover in what point i could be 
                         so unfortunate as to offend you. my 
                         esteem for your family is very sincere 
                         but if i have given rise to a belief 
                         of more than i felt or meant to 
                         express, i shall reproach myself for 
                         not having been more guarded. my 
                         affections have long been engaged 
                         elsewhere and it is with great regret 
                         that i return your letters and the 
                         lock of hair which you so obligingly 
                         bestowed upon me. i am etc. john 
                         willoughby.'

                                     elinor
                         oh, marianne.

               marianne gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across 
               the bed as though in physical agony.

                                     elinor
                         marianne, oh, marianne--it is better 
                         to know at once what his intentions 
                         are. dearest, think of what you would 
                         have felt if your engagement had 
                         carried on for months and months 
                         before he chose to put an end to it.

                                     marianne
                         we are not engaged.

                                     elinor
                         but you wrote to him! i thought then 
                         that he must have left you with some 
                         kind of understanding?

                                     marianne
                         no--he is not so unworthy as you 
                         think him.

                                     elinor
                         not so unworthy! did he tell you 
                         that he loved you?

                                     marianne
                         yes. no--never absolutely. it was 
                         every day implied, but never declared. 
                         sometimes i thought it had been, but 
                         it never was. he has broken no vow.

                                     elinor
                         he has broken faith with all of us, 
                         he made us all believe he loved you.

                                     marianne
                         he did! he did--he loved me as i 
                         loved him.

               mrs jennings bursts through the door in her hat and coat, 
               panting.

                                     mrs jennings
                         i had to come straight up--how are 
                         you, miss marianne?

               marianne begins to sob uncontrollably.

                                     mrs jennings
                         poor thing! she looks very bad. no 
                         wonder, miss dashwood, for it is but 
                         too true. i was told here in the 
                         street by miss morton, who is a great 
                         friend: he is to be married at the 
                         end of the month--to a miss grey 
                         with fifty thousand pounds. well, 
                         said i, if 'tis true, then he is a 
                         good-for-nothing who has used my 
                         young friend abominably ill, and i 
                         wish with all my soul that his wife 
                         may plague his heart out!

               she goes round the bed to comfort marianne.

                                     mrs jennings
                         but he is not the only young man 
                         worth having, my dear, and with your 
                         pretty face you will never want for 
                         admirers.

               marianne sobs even harder.

                                     mrs jennings
                         ah, me! she had better have her cry 
                         out and have done with it. i will go 
                         and look out something to tempt her--
                         does she care for olives?

                                     elinor
                         i cannot tell you.

               mrs jennings leaves. marianne seizes the letter again.

                                     marianne
                         i cannot believe his nature capable 
                         of such cruelty!

                                     elinor
                         marianne, there is no excuse for him--
                         this is his hand--

                                     marianne
                         but it cannot be his heart! oh, mamma! 
                         i want mamma! elinor, please take me 
                         home! cannot we go tomorrow?

                                     elinor
                         there is no one to take us.

                                     marianne
                         cannot we hire a carriage?

                                     elinor
                         we have no money--and indeed we owe 
                         mrs jennings more courtesy.

                                     marianne
                         all she wants is gossip and she only 
                         likes me because i supply it! oh, 
                         god! i cannot endure to stay.

                                     elinor
                         i will find a way. i promise.
