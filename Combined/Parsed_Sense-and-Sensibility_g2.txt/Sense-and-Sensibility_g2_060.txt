               int. barton cottage - front door - day

               mrs dashwood and elinor rush to the front door. they see the 
               stranger carrying marianne up the garden path, his scarlet 
               coat staining the monochrome rain.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         marianne!

               the stranger reaches the door. this is no time for 
               introductions.

                                     elinor
                         in here, sir--this way. margaret, 
                         open the door wider. please, sir, 
                         lay her here. marianne, are you in 
                         pain?

               they move into the parlour.
