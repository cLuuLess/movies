               ext. square in front of mrs jennings's house - london - day

               elinor and brandon walk round the quiet square.

                                     colonel brandon
                         have i been rightly informed? is it 
                         so?

               elinor is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query.

                                     elinor
                         it is indeed so. are you acquainted 
                         with mr ferrars?

                                     colonel brandon
                         no, we have never met. but i know 
                         only too well the cruelty--the 
                         impolitic cruelty of dividing two 
                         young people long attached to one 
                         another. mrs ferrars does not know 
                         what she may drive her son to--

               he pauses, frowning in remembrance. elinor waits in suspense.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i have a proposal to make that should 
                         enable him to marry miss steele 
                         immediately. since the gentleman is 
                         so close a friend to your family, 
                         perhaps you will be good enough to 
                         mention it to him?

               elinor is completely taken aback. she takes a moment to reply.

                                     elinor
                         colonel, i am sure he would be only 
                         too delighted to hear it from your 
                         own lips.

                                     colonel brandon
                         i think not. his behaviour has proved 
                         him proud--in the best sense. i feel 
                         certain this is the right course.
