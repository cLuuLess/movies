               int. barton cottage - parlour - morning

               the dashwoods are having a frustrating time winkling 
               information about willoughby out of sir john, who is in turn 
               only anxious to protect brandon's interest. marianne has her 
               bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.

                                     marianne
                         but what do you know of mr willoughby, 
                         sir john?

                                     sir john
                         decent shot--and there is not a bolder 
                         rider in all england.

                                     marianne
                         but what is he like?

                                     sir john
                         like?

                                     marianne
                         what are his tastes? his passions? 
                         his pursuits?

                                     sir john
                              (mystified)
                         well, he has the nicest little bitch 
                         of a pointer--was she out with him 
                         yesterday?

               marianne gives up. mrs dashwood takes over.

                                     mrs dashwood
                         where is allenham, sir john?

                                     sir john
                         nice little estate three miles east. 
                         he is to inherit it from an elderly 
                         relative--lady allen is her name.

               now they are getting somewhere. marianne is about to ask 
               another question when they hear a horse galloping up. everyone 
               is electrified. margaret runs to the window and turns back 
               in disappointment.

                                     margaret
                         it is colonel brandon. i shall go 
                         outside and keep watch.

               margaret runs out of the room.

                                     sir john
                         you are all on the lookout for 
                         willoughby, eh? dear me, poor brandon. 
                         you will none of you think of him 
                         now.

               brandon is admitted by betsy. he is carrying a large bunch 
               of hothouse flowers.

                                     colonel brandon
                         how is the invalid?

               he hands marianne the flowers with a smile.

                                     marianne
                         thank you so much, colonel.

               she rather absently hands the flowers to elinor, who goes 
               for a vase. sir john gestures at brandon with bluff 
               insensitivity.

                                     sir john
                         miss marianne, i cannot see why you 
                         should set your cap at mr willoughby 
                         when you have already made such a 
                         splendid conquest!

                                     marianne
                         i have no intention of 'setting my 
                         cap' at anyone, sir john!

                                     colonel brandon
                         mr willoughby--lady allen's nephew?

               brandon's light tone betrays no emotion. elinor comes back 
               in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to 
               marianne.

                                     sir john
                         aye, he visits every year for he is 
                         to inherit allenham--and he has a 
                         very pretty estate of his own, miss 
                         dashwood, combe magna in somerset. 
                         if i were you, i would not give him 
                         up to my younger sister in spite of 
                         all this tumbling down hills.

               suddenly margaret runs in screaming 'marianne's preserver!' 
               at the top of her voice. everyone starts to move at once. 
               margaret is silenced. brandon looks at marianne, whose 
               incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.

                                     sir john
                         here is the man himself. come, brandon--
                         we know when we are not wanted. let 
                         us leave him to the ladies!

                                     elinor
                         marianne! sir john and the colonel 
                         are leaving.

               marianne looks up, suddenly self-conscious.

                                     marianne
                         goodbye, colonel. thank you for the 
                         flowers.

               elinor sees them out. we hear willoughby's voice outside. 
               close on marianne's radiant anticipation.
