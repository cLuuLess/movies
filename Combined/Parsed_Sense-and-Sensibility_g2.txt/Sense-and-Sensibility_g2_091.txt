               int. barton cottage - elinor/marianne's bedroom - night

               we are in elinor and marianne's bedroom. elinor is in bed. 
               she is lying on her side with her back to marianne. we are 
               close on her face. marianne is running around excitedly, 
               pulling out ribbons, looking at dresses, etc.

                                     marianne
                         i was never so grateful in all my 
                         life as i am to mrs jennings. what a 
                         kind woman she is! i like her more 
                         than i can say. oh, elinor! i shall 
                         see willoughby. think how surprised 
                         he will be! and you will see edward!

               elinor cannot reply.

                                     marianne
                         are you asleep?

                                     elinor
                         with you in the room?

               marianne laughs.

                                     marianne
                         i do not believe you feel as calm as 
                         you look, not even you, elinor. i 
                         will never sleep tonight! oh, what 
                         were you and miss steele whispering 
                         about so long?

               close on elinor's expression as she struggles with the 
               impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without 
               breaking her promise to lucy. after a pause--

                                     elinor
                         nothing of significance.

               marianne looks at elinor curiously, then returns to her 
               packing.
