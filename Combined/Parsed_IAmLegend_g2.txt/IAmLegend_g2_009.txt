int.  hospital corridor - 6th floor - day

neville emerges on the sixth floor.  even more unusual
activity here.  he can see orderlies pushing patients on
gurneys and overworked doctors scurrying here and there.

he sees that one of the corridors has been sealed with a
strip of yellow cdc quarantine tape.

he goes to the busy nurses' station.

                     neville
          i'm here to see virginia neville.

a tired nurse glances up.

                     nurse
          you're not supposed to be here.

neville notices that a national guardsman is sitting in a
room behind the nurses' station, a machine gun rests at his
side.  he is staring at neville.

                     neville
          i need to see dr. madden.

                     nurse
          i'm sorry, you'll have to wait
          downstairs --

                     neville
          i'm not going to wait downstairs.  i
          want to see my wife.

the national guardsman stands and begins walking to them,
sensing trouble.

                     nurse
               (to a passing doctor)
          dr. madden, this man --

                     neville
               (turning to dr. madden)
          dr. madden, i'm robert neville, we
          talked yesterday, my wife --

                     national guardsman
          is there a problem here?

                     dr. madden
          no, no problem.

the guardsman returns to his post as dr. madden walks away,
flipping through a stack of medical charts.  dr. madden is in
his 60's, absolutely exhausted and preoccupied.

neville follows him:

                     neville
          where's my wife?

                     dr. madden
          you have to go downstairs, i'll call
          you when --

                     neville
          where is my wife?

dr. madden finally stops and turns to him:

                     dr. madden
          look, i have two hundred patients in
          this ward alone.  i'll be getting to
          your wife on my next rotation.
          until then --

                     neville
               (firmly)
          is she all right?

a beat.

dr. madden does not look him in the eye.

                     dr. madden
          please go downstairs to the lobby
          and i'll call in about four hours.

he goes.

neville stands for a moment.

he notes that the national guardsman is busy on the phone and
the nurse is searching through a file cabinet.

he quickly goes to the corridor with the yellow cdc
quarantine tape and slips under it...
