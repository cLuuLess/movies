ext.  store - alley - night

right into another hemocyte --

it is at the hummer, peering in --

it spins and flies across the alley at him -- so amazingly
fast -- no time to draw his pistol --

instinctively -- neville punches forward -- an enormous punch
-- the hemocyte collides right into his fist -- it's own
momentum defeating it.

and it is down and out.

he quickly pulls his pistol and aims it at the creature.

he stops.  he doesn't shoot.

a beat.

he can see something on the hemocyte.  he leans down.
through the rags and wrapping he sees an antique silver
locket glinting.

he looks at it for an unsure second and then leans down and
yanks the locket away.  he opens it and looks inside.

we do not see what is inside the locket, but neville's
usually stoic face betrays a quick flash of emotion.
