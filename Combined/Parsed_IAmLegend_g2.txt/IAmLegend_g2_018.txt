ext.  neville's house - day

we are seeing the los angeles skyline from high in the
hollywood hills.

we see the outlines and forms of recognizable buildings in
the distance.  nothing immediately peculiar about any of
this.  just quiet.

a beautiful sunny morning.

title:  winter 2002

a bird flutters close and lands on a wooden rail.  we seem to
be watching the bird through a window.  we note some grill
work and just a hint of razor wire on the rail.

still, nothing too out of the ordinary.

the shrill bell of an old windup alarm clock suddenly
shatters the pristine silence.

the bird takes off.
