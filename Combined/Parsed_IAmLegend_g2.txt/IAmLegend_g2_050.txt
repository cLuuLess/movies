int.  neville's house - living room - night

neville is standing at the picture windows of his living room
holding a glass of cognac.  he stares at the darkened skyline
of los angeles in the distance.

and then, almost on impulse, he goes to the stereo unit and
looks at a collection of about a dozen audio tapes.  they are
labeled:  "virginia 1," "virginia 2," "virginia 3," etc.

next to the cassette tapes is a framed picture of virginia.

he selects "virginia 3" and puts it into the cassette deck.

an unsure beat.

then he presses "play."

his wife's voice fills the house:

                     virginia (v.o.)
          -- suppose that's only natural.  but
          i spend a lot of time looking back
          now.  probably way too sentimental,
          all this looking back --
               (wryly)
          -- but given the option...

neville smiles.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          i remember the first time we met.
          do you remember that?

                     neville
          yes.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          it was at diane's party in malibu
          and i had just broken up with todd
          and i was loaded for bear, any man
          who had the nerve to come at me --
          watch out.  so you come sauntering
          in -- you know that saunter you do.
          that watch out, baby, here comes
          mr. smooth thing.

neville smiles and moves to the window, taking a sip of
cognac.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          and you're like this mountain
          cutting through the party and all
          the girls are whispering, "ooo, who
          is that hunk o' man?"
               (she laughs, as does
                neville)
          so finally you work your way to me
          and i'm all ice.  so you turn on
          the smooth thing and i finally say
          "look, bob or buck or whatever the
          hell your name is, you're too
          goddamn big and you scare me so
          take that filthy cigar and go play
          bruce willis somewhere else."

neville laughs.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          and the look on your face!  it was
          like i kicked your puppy or
          something!  this wounded little boy
          face on top of this glacier body...

a beat.

neville's smile fades.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          i fell in love with you right then,
          i think.

virginia continues with some difficulty:

                     virginia (v.o.)
          the funny thing is that i'm really
          going to miss those damn cigars.
          sometimes when you're at work and i
          -- now that i can't go out -- i
          light one.  one of your cigars.  i
          bet you don't know that...

neville, moved, leans his forehead against the glass of the
window overlooking the silent city.

                     virginia (v.o.)
          and...i just let it burn down.
          because it makes me think of you.
          and all i want to do is think of
          you.

neville is leaning against the window, utter despair.

                     neville
          all i want to do is think of you.

silence...
