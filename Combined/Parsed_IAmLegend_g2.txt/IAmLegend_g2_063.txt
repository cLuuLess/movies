int.  neville's house - medical room - night

the refrigerator in the medical room is open.

this is neville's only refrigeration and precious.  inside is
a collection of drugs and a dozen pouches of blood.  his
blood, in case of emergency.  each pouch contains about a
pint.

he has also stored a collection of different batteries in the
fridge.  and a few bottles of expensive vodka.

he removes an ampule from the fridge and fills a syringe.  he
injects himself, a tetanus shot.

he returns the ampule and takes out a bottle of vodka.  he
kicks the fridge shut and takes a slug of vodka.

he is going to need it.

he carefully sanitizes the wound on his forearm with some
antiseptic and then, after another swig of vodka, begins
putting in stitches.
