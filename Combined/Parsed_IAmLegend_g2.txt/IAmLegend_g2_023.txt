he emerges from the emergency stairway at the 46th floor.  he
has climbed all the way so he is sweating and panting a bit.

he goes down a dark corridor and enters the ktzy radio
station.

a burst of sunlight.  many windows.  the city outside.

through the windows we can see that the station is at the top
of the building.  neville has clearly been here before.
boxes of electronic parts and technical manuals are piled
everywhere around the room.

a large radio broadcasting panel is foremost.  neville has
hooked this panel to five large gas generators.  the
generators are humming with life, lights on the panel are
illuminated.

a reel-to-reel tape loop is running.

he switches on the speaker and his own voice fills the room:

                     neville (v.o.)
          ... tallest building downtown.  you
          can't miss it.

the loop repeats:

                     neville (v.o.)

          in los angeles.  rendezvous at the
          plaza in front of the branson
          building.  i'll check every three
          days at noon.  if you can't wait
          leave a sign.  it's the tallest
          building downtown.  you can't miss
          it.

the loop begins to repeat:

                     neville (v.o.)
          this is robert neville.  i am --

he switches the speaker off, satisfied, and then carefully
begins filling the generators with gas.
