int./ ext.  rover - hills - day

he pulls the rover onto the street outside his compound and
stops, the engine idling.  he looks down a long, twisting
road toward the city.

we note a picture of his wife, virginia, fastened with a
rubber band to the sun visor.

we also see a number of hatch marks drawn on the roof of the
rover above him.  he has counted up to about forty of
something.

he has a stopwatch dangling from the rearview mirror.  he
revs the powerful engine and then presses the start button on
the stopwatch -- and he floors it --

the rover explodes down the hill -- it is every driver's
ultimate fantasy -- racing like crazy down a twisting,
mountainous road at top speed -- no fear of opposing traffic
-- neville speeds from lane to lane, racing against the
stopwatch, trying to beat his best time -- the rover careens
wildly around obstacles and hurtles through traffic lights
and flies over hills -- neville enjoys the wild adrenaline
rush of pure speed -- he checks his time -- punches the gas
-- faster --

an abandoned tank is ahead of him at the bottom of the hill.

in a final burst of speed he screeches past the tank -- he
reaches up and stops the stopwatch -- he hollers and blows
his horn in joy -- his best time yet.

in the tank, two nesting white cranes are disturbed by the
horn -- they fly up from the tank's turret...
