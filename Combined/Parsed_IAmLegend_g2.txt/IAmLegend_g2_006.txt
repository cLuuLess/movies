int.  bathroom - gas station - night

neville is washing his hands in the tiny gas station
bathroom.

he hears a sound over the running tap water -- a strange
sound, elliptical -- is it a coyote howling?  something
mechanical?

he turns off the water.  listens.  nothing.

the lights suddenly snap off in the bathroom.

he steps from the bathroom...
