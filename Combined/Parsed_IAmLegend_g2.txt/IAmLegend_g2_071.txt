int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - above - night

he creeps to the upper observation level and peeks down, not
wanting the creature to see him.

what he sees is amazing.  and then astounding.

the hemocyte is crouched in the corner, facing the wall.

it has pulled off a good deal of its clothing and bedouin
wrappings.  we see more of the eerie flesh-less body, the
veins, arteries and muscles.  we even see some skeletal
structure through the viscous outer layers.

from behind it is incredibly lean and muscular.  we literally
see the muscles working on the arms and back as it pulls at
its face coverings.

but there is something else about the figure.

the hemocyte slowly turns its head to neville.

although the skeleton frame is almost sexless there is
something about the contours of the "face" -- the high
cheekbones and large eyes.  there is a certain graceful, even
elegant quality to it.

it is a woman.

                     neville
               (quietly)
          my god...

she stares up at him.  not threatening.  not feral.  if
anything, quietly defiant.

                     neville
          can you understand me?

the hemocyte woman tilts her head back and forth, her jaws
working slowly but compulsively.

                     neville
          what is your name?

the hemocyte woman suddenly stands -- faster than any human
could move -- but she does not attack.  she is very tall.

then she quickly turns back to her corner and covers her head
in her hands, her talons rapping insistently on her clean,
hairless skull.

it has been a long day, neville is weary.  he turns out the
court lights and leaves.
