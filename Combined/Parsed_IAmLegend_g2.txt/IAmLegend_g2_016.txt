int.  the neville home - den - night

neville is asleep on the sofa in front of the tv.

on the tv a discovery channel wildlife show is on.  we see a
water buffalo being dragged down by a pack of jackals.  the
jackals circle and strike without mercy and ravage the
buffalo.  the buffalo roars in impotent torment --

the tv image suddenly snaps to a test pattern.

then snaps to a please stand by message.

we push in and in and in on the tv screen until the message
is nothing more than a grating, hissing field of pulsing
white dots...

then the dots are grains of sand...
