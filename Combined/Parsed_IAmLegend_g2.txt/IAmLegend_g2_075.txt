int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - above - day

neville, now dressed in one of his body suits, stands on the
upper observation area.

the hemocyte woman, now comfortably in the darkened court, is
sitting in the corner.

she is looking up at him.  always wary.  but something else
as well.  appreciative.  curious.

a breakthrough.

she is beginning to trust him, although the edge of quiet
defiance and resentment continues.

meanwhile, neville has filled a small plastic container with
some blood.

he carefully lowers the plastic container of blood down to
the court on a string.

she looks at it -- she does not attack -- she looks back at
him.

                     neville
               (gently)
          go ahead...

she looks back to the container and then slowly creeps
forward, on all fours like a spider.  she is unused to having
her food in such an odd form.

she sniffs at the container -- darts her tongue in -- and
then quickly turns away from him and drains the blood --
licking out every drop.

neville pulls the container up again.

she looks up at him.

                     neville
          what is your name?

she does not respond.

he switches out the light and leaves his pet to the
comforting darkness.
