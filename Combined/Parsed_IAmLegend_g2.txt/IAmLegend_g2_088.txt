int.  neville's house - dining room - night

after dinner.  the remains of a meal are before neville.
there are no plates or food before emma.

the house is dark except for a candelabra glowing on the
table.  the windows show dramatic vistas of the dead city.

immediate confrontation:

                     neville
          what choice did i have -- ?!

                     emma
          you hunt us like animals -- do you
          know how many you have slaughtered?!

                     neville
          i only protect myself -- !

                     emma
               (insistently)
          you are the human.  the hunter.  the
          thing that comes in the day and
          kills --

                     neville
               (angrily)
          if i'm a hunter it's because you
          taught me to be!

she stands very quickly and stalks around the room
relentlessly, still the caged tigress.

neville watches her prowl.  under the table, he rests his
hand on the butt of his pistol.

she stops and looks at the black city in the distance as if
it were calling to her.

a long beat.  she has her back to him.

                     emma
          what do you want?

                     neville
          what do you mean?

                     emma
          you know what i mean.

she turns to him:

                     emma
          are you going to keep me caged up
          forever?

he does not respond.

                     emma
          will you keep feeding me?  how long
          can you live like that?  until it
          kills you?  until i kill you?
          without your blood i'll go back.

                     neville
          we don't know that --

                     emma
          i know it.  what do you want,
          robert?

a difficult moment.

                     neville
               (simply)
          i wanted to hear someone say my
          name.

a beat.

                     emma
          then know i am what i am.  i could
          be across this room and on your
          throat before you had time to
          scream.

a beat.

he fishes in his pocket and holds up the antique silver
locket he took from her when he captured her.

                     neville
          do you recognize this?

she instinctively reaches for her neck, where the locket used
to hang:

                     emma
          mine.

                     neville
          have you always had it?

                     emma
          i don't know.

                     neville
          have you looked inside?

                     emma
          yes.

                     neville
          what's inside?

                     emma
          humans.

                     neville
          who?

                     emma
          i don't know.

a beat.

he rises and hands the locket to her.

                     neville
          look inside now.

she opens the locket.

inside, she sees a picture of herself with her husband and
young daughter.  happy.  a family.

her eyes almost immediately fill with tears.

                     neville
          that's who you are too, emma.

                     emma
               (quietly)
          before... when i was one of them.
          i would look at this and it was just
          strangers.  now i... remember.

she gently shuts the locket.

she finally looks up at him.

                     emma
          i don't want to remember.
