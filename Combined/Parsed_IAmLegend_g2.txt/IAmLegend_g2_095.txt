int.  neville's house - racquet ball court - day

neville, now dressed in one of his body suits, appears at the
court.  he carries a container of blood.  he unlocks the door
and enters.

                     neville
          i have to go into the city.

a beat.

                     neville
          i won't lock you in.  you can go if
          you want to.  or wait until tonight.
          i won't keep you prisoner.

a beat.

                     emma
          you want me to stay?

                     neville
          yes.

she takes the container of blood.  for the first time she
does not turn away to feed, she looks right in his eyes as
she drains it.

then:

                     emma
          do you still want me to stay?

                     neville
          yes.

a beat.

                     emma
          i'll be here.

she touches the locket.

                     emma
          i want to remember my daughter.
