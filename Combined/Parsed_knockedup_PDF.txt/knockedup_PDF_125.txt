alison, jill and jack are in the office. 
jack 
alison, thank you for coming in. i 
donÕt want to shock you, but know 
whatÕs under that jacket. youÕre 
pregnant, have been for a while. from 
my count, youÕre right around eight 
months. and i donÕt know why you felt 
you couldnÕt tell us. 
alison 
iÕm really sorry. 
jill 
this is hollywood. we donÕt like 
liars. 
alison 
i just wasnÕt expecting this and, i 
didnÕt know how to handle it, and i 
didnÕt want to lose my job. iÕm really 
sorry. 
jack 
itÕs unfortunate that you didnÕt tell 
us because you wouldÕve found out that 
we thought itÕs great. 
knocked up - 114.
alison 
really? 
jill 
yeah. 
jack 
so, we did some research. and turns 
out, people like pregnant. 
alison 
oh, my god! 
jack 
the bigger you are, the bigger your 
numbers. 
jill 
i was surprised because i feel the 
opposite. 
jack 
weÕre going to do a whole maternity 
month on Òe, exclamation, mommy.Ó 
youÕre going to interview all the 
pregnant celebs. 
alison 
really? 
jack 
yes. 
jill 
scary! 
jack 
if youÕre pregnant, theyÕre pregnant, 
you can talk about being pregnant. 
jill 
it just grosses me out...when i know 
that people are pregnant. because i 
think about the birth. everythingÕs so 
wet. 
jack 
and everything that goes into it. none 
of the gross stuff. but you know, 
hopes, dreams, whatever. itÕs going to 
be great. 
alison 
oh, my god. this is such good news. 
thank you so much. 
jack 
youÕre welcome. and then, after the 
baby is out, tighten it back up. 
jill 
tight. and please donÕt lie to us 
again. because maybe someday we could 
be friends. 
knocked up - 115.
