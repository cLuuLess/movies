int. fancy restaurant 
debbie, pete, alison and ben eat dinner together. 
pete 
youÕre not going to tell them? 
alison 
no. i donÕt have to. itÕs illegal for 
them to fire me over it. and i get 
three months maternity leave if i 
stay. so iÕm not going to tell them. 
debbie 
good plan. 
pete 
i like it. 
ben 
itÕs a good plan until her water 
breaks over robert de niroÕs shoes. 
(impersonating robert de 
niro) 
my shoes. thereÕs baby goo on them. 
pete 
(impersonating robert de 
niro) 
these shoes? on these shoes? did you 
puke on my shoes? 
ben 
(impersonating robert de 
niro) 
is your water on my shoes? 
knocked up - 75.
pete 
(back as pete) 
isnÕt it weird, though, when you have 
a kid and all your dreams and hopes go 
right out the window. 
debbie 
what changed for you? what went out 
the window? you do everything exactly 
the same. 
pete 
no, i love what iÕm doing. but say 
before youÕre married with children 
you want to live in india for a year. 
you can do it. 
debbie 
you want to go to india? go to india! 
seriously. 
pete 
do you want to go to india? 
debbie 
no. you can go. 
ben 
i get what he means. honestly, when i 
found out about... 
ben motions towards alison. 
ben (contÕd) 
...i had this flash of me in a white 
ford bronco hauling ass for canada. 
the chopperÕs taping it, and i bust 
through the border and iÕm free! i 
kept thinking that. 
alison stares at ben. 
ben (contÕd) 
it was a flash! 
alison 
what do you mean? 
ben 
donÕt look at me. we can talk about 
our fears here. if doc brown screeched 
up to you in the delorean and said, 
Òalison, i got the car here. what do 
you want to do?Ó no part of you would 
think, Òmaybe iÕll go back to that 
night and put a condom on benÕs dick?Ó 
you never got that flash? 
alison 
no. what are you talking about? 
pete 
Òwhere weÕre going, we donÕt need 
roads.Ó 
knocked up - 76.
ben 
you wouldnÕt do that? 
alison 
i donÕt know who doc brown is. what 
are you talking about? 
ben 
doc brown is christopher lloyd. he 
invented the delorean time machine. 
pete 
everyone has a time machine image. 
debbie 
i have a really good idea. why donÕt 
you two get in your time machine, go 
back in time and fuck each other? 
pete 
who needs a time machine? 
ben holds up his drink. 
ben 
this is my time machine! 
pete 
(to ben) 
iÕll throw you in my delorean and gun 
it to 88. 
ben 
(to pete) 
you are a funny motherfucker, man. 
(to debbie) 
how can you fight with him? i just 
want to kiss his face. heÕs cute. 
pete 
(to ben) 
i like the way you move. 
ben 
this is fun! we should do this more. 
this is the most fun iÕve had in a 
really long time.
