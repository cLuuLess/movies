int. benÕs house - night 
ben sits on the couch and talks to harris on the telephone. 
ben 
you screwed me, dad, okay? you said 
everything was going to be fine and 
nothing is fine. nothing is fine. 
harris (o.s.) 
ben, iÕve been divorced three times. 
why would you listen to me? 
ben 
because you were the only one giving 
me advice! and it was, it was terrible 
advice! 
harris (o.s.) 
you can go around blaming everyone 
else, but in the end, until you take 
responsibility for yourself, none of 
this is going to work out. 
ben 
i donÕt know how to take 
responsibility for myself, okay? i 
didnÕt read the baby books! 
harris (o.s.) 
you didnÕt read the books? 
ben 
i should smoke less pot. i donÕt know 
what to do! iÕm an idiot! what, tell 
me what to do! 
harris (o.s.) 
i donÕt know. i donÕt know. ben, i 
love ya. what can i tell ya? 
ben
