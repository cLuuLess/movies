ext. benÕs house 
ben and pete knock on the front door. 
ben 
since when do we lock this fucking 
thing? come on! 
jason opens the door with jonah and jay. all of their eyes are 
very infected. 
jason 
yo. we canÕt go, dude. sorry. 
ben 
holy crap! what happened? 
jonah 
we got pink eye. 
ben 
what? you giving each other butterfly 
kisses or something? 
jason 
very funny. thatÕs not how you get 
pink eye. you get it from poo 
particles making their way into your 
ocular cavities. 
knocked up - 96.
jay 
hey, ben. 
ben 
yo. 
jay 
howÕs it going? i farted on jasonÕs 
pillow as a practical joke. he farted 
on jonahÕs, thinking it was mine. and 
then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. 
iÕm not proud of this. but, i think 
weÕve all forgiven each other. but, we 
canÕt go anywhere. 
pete 
you can get pink eye from farting in a 
pillow? 
jonah 
totally. 
pete 
thatÕs awesome. 
jonah 
yeah, but you got to be bare-assed. 
martin enters the doorway, his eyes are the worst. 
ben 
jesus. martin got it bad! what, did 
someone take a dump right in your eye? 
martin 
no. no pink eye for me. iÕm just 
really...high. 
ben 
well stay back, guys. i got to get my 
suit. 
ben enters the house and the guys pretend theyÕre going to rub 
their faces on him. pete stays outside. 
jason 
(to pete) 
are you debbieÕs husband? 
pete 
yeah. 
jason shuts the door on pete. 
i/e. peteÕs convertible - night 
pete drives with ben to vegas. they are wearing suits. 
ben

knocked up - 97.
pete 
this is great. weÕre going to have the 
best time ever. 
ben 
we make a good team, man. 
pete 
yep. itÕs like i canÕt come here with 
debbie. she doesnÕt understand. itÕs 
like she wants to hold me in, and she 
was telling alison she could train 
you. 
ben 
she thinks she could train me? 
pete 
yeah, like youÕre running the triple 
crown. 
ben 
she canÕt train this! iÕm like 
siegfried and royÕs bengal. you think 
iÕm trained. iÕll bite your fucking 
face off. 
pete 
thatÕs right. 
ben 
in front of a crowd, baby. 
pete

if i have enough of these babies to go 
around. 
pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms. 
ben

pete 
i got them from a roadie for the black 
crowes. 
ben 
iÕm eating them. 
pete

cirque du soleil.
