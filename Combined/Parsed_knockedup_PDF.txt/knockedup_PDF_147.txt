int. hospital - hallway 
ben and dr. kuni stand in the hallway. 
knocked up - 128.
dr. kuni 
that woman is a control freak, and she 
needs to let go and let me do my job. 
ben 
look, sheÕs just having a hard time 
because her and her doctor had a very 
specific birth plan. and they wanted 
it to be a very special experience. 
dr. kuni 
okay. if you want a special 
experience, go to a jimmy buffet 
concert. we have a new birth plan: get 
the baby out safely. 
ben 
look, man, will you help us out? i 
have no idea what iÕm doing. you can 
be as big a dick to me as you want. 
just be nice to her, man. thatÕs all i 
ask. just please be nice to her. 
benÕs stomach growls loudly. 
dr. kuni 
are you okay? 
ben 
i think so. 
dr. kuni 
iÕm sorry. letÕs start fresh. 
ben 
thank you, man. 
dr. kuni 
this is healthy. this is good. i think 
weÕre bonding.
