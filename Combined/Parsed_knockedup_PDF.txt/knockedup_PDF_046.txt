int. micelliÕs restaurant 
alison and ben sit in a booth over appetizers. 
alison 
the funny thing is i really had never 
even thought about having a baby. 
ben 
yeah. 
alison 
if this hadnÕt happened, i donÕt think 
i would have wanted to have a baby 
for, like, i donÕt know, at least ten 
years. 
ben 
at least! god, honestly, i just got 
used to the notion that someone would 
even have sex with me. i didnÕt think 
this would happen.
