int. benÕs house, benÕs bedroom 
ben and alison sort through the debris of porn, trash and weed 
among other things. 
alison finds benÕs bank statement that indicates he only has only 
$117.13. 
ben 
you know itÕs times like this iÕm glad 
i donÕt own nice things. itÕs a big 
mess, but thereÕs only like fifty 
bucks worth of shit here. thatÕs kind 
of the good thing. you know, my dad 
told me, ÒdonÕt move to northridge.Ó 
but you figure, what are the chances 
of that happening twice, you know? 
alison picks up a huge sword. 
alison 
what is this? 
ben 
itÕs a ninja weapon. i hope this place 
doesnÕt get condemned. that would 
suck. 
alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. none 
of them have been read. alison sadly puts them back without ben 
noticing.
