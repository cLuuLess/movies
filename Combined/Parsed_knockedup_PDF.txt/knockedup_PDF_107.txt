int. vegas hotel room - night 
ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on. a scene from 
Òcheaper by the dozenÓ plays on the television. steve martin 
juggles all of his children. 
steve martin 
(on tv) 
letÕs move, gang! come on, come on, 
come on! jessica, can you get these 
plates and put them on the table, 
please?! 
knocked up - 103.
ben 
this isnÕt funny. that guy has twelve 
kids. itÕs not funny. this is sick. 
this is a sick movie. thatÕs a lot of 
responsibility to be joking about. 
thatÕs not funny. i got to turn this 
off. itÕs freaking me out. 
pete moves several chairs into the bedroom. 
pete 
there are five different types of 
chairs in this hotel room. 
ben 
holy fuck. what are they all doing in 
here? 
pete 
these are five different types of 
chair. 
ben 
get them out of here, man. this is too 
many chairs for one room. 
pete 
thereÕs a guy that works for this 
hotel. his whole job is to find 
chairs. 
pete moves to a tall chair. 
pete (contÕd) 
look at this one. look at it. itÕs 
gold and red and itÕs kind of shiny. 
shiny thread? unbelievable. it is 
beautiful, and it feels amazing. 
ben 
the tall oneÕs gawking at me and the 
short oneÕs being very droll. i donÕt 
like them. 
pete switches to another chair. 
pete 
oh, wow! 
ben 
itÕs weird that chairs even exist when 
youÕre not sitting on them. 
pete switched to another tall chair. 
pete 
iÕm up high! iÕm really high up. 
ben 
i shouldÕve read the baby books. 
pete 
why didnÕt you read the baby books? 
knocked up - 104.
ben 
because then itÕs real, you know? 
pete 
dude, itÕs real whether or not you 
read those books. that babyÕs coming. 
pete sits on another chair. 
pete (contÕd) 
oh, man! 
ben 
think theyÕll take us back? 
pete 
yes. but i donÕt know why. do you ever 
wonder how somebody could even like 
you? 
ben 
all the time, man. like every day. i 
wonder how you like me. 
pete 
how can debbie like me? she likes me. 
i mean, she loves me. the biggest 
problem in our marriage is that she 
wants me around. she loves me so much 
that she wants me around all the time. 
thatÕs our biggest problem. and i 
canÕt even accept that? uh, like that 
upsets me?! 
ben sits up from the bed. 
ben 
what? 
pete 
sheÕs the one. she loves me. 
ben 
you canÕt believe...that people love 
you? i love you, man! debbie loves 
you! 
pete 
i donÕt think i can accept her love. 
thereÕs something wrong with me. 
ben 
you canÕt accept love? 
pete 
i donÕt know what it is. 
ben 
love? the most beautiful, shiny, warmy 
thing in the world? you canÕt accept 
it? 
pete 
i have to go to this other chair. 
knocked up - 105.
pete switches to a new chair. 
pete (contÕd) 
oh, this is a better energy. 
ben 
you canÕt accept pure love? you canÕt 
accept debbie? sheÕs chosen to give 
you her life. sheÕs picked you as her 
life partner! but you play fantasy 
baseball because you canÕt accept her 
love? 
ben burps. 
ben (contÕd) 
ugh. i could accept it, man. and 
debbieÕs amazing, man. sheÕs cool and 
sheÕs funny and she smells good and 
sheÕs nice and her hair always looks 
different. sheÕs too good for you, 
man. 
pete shoves his hand in his mouth. 
pete 
tastes like a rainbow. 
ben 
youÕre disgusting. youÕre an urchin. 
and she busts your balls because 
youÕre a little bitch! youÕre a filthy 
bitch! and iÕd bust your balls! debbie 
wants to give her life to you and 
alison doesnÕt want to do that with 
me. and it makes me sad all day. i 
want to go home. 
pete 
(with fist in mouth) 
i want to go home, too.
