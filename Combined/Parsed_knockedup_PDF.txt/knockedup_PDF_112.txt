ext. debbie and pete's house, backyard 
alison and ben talk off to the side. 
alison 
i just donÕt think we can make it 
work. 
ben 
we can get back on track and 
everythingÕs going to be great. 
alison 
youÕre just being nice. and iÕm being 
nice and just because weÕre two nice 
people doesnÕt mean we should stay 
together. i donÕt want this baby to 
determine the rest of our lives. you 
know? me not wanting to do this alone 
isnÕt enough of a reason to drag you 
into a relationship with me. itÕs just 
not fair. and, and donÕt repeat this, 
but, god, i donÕt want to end up like 
debbie. 
ben 
but debbieÕs happy. 
alison 
sheÕs happy today. but every day is a 
constant struggle for them because 
theyÕre not right for each other. you 
know? and they have to force it and i 
donÕt want us to have to do that. i 
donÕt want to force you to be what i 
think you should be. thatÕs wrong of 
me because youÕre great. you really 
are. youÕre great the way you are and, 
i mean, you like to get high and you 
like to do shrooms in vegas. 
knocked up - 109.
ben 
i didnÕt do shrooms in vegas. 
alison 
and who am i to stop you? who am i to 
tell you that thatÕs wrong? itÕs not 
wrong. itÕs who you are. itÕs what you 
enjoy and thatÕs your life and... 
ben 
iÕm not that guy anymore. 
alison 
we can be friends. and you can be 
there when the baby is born, and in 
the babyÕs life as much as you want. i 
hope you will be. 
ben 
if you give me a shot to just show you 
that iÕm con-- 
debbie approaches. 
debbie 
excuse me? 
ben 
oh, shit. 
debbie 
(to alison) 
can you grab the video camera? weÕre 
going to sing Òhappy birthdayÓ now. 
alison 
yeah. 
(to ben) 
iÕm sorry. i got to go. iÕm sorry. 
ben 
itÕs okay. 
alison 
iÕll be right back. weÕll finish 
talking.
