the fetal heart monitors begins to beep. 
alison

ben 
what the hell was that? 
samuel hurries in to check the monitor. 
ben (contÕd) 
whatÕs that, whatÕs happening? 
dr. kuni enters. 
dr. kuni 
well, boy and girls, what seems to be 
the problem? 
samuel 
decels. 
dr. kuni 
oh, dear. okay. alison, i need you to 
turn on your back now, okay? the 
babyÕs heart rate is slowing. okay? 
ben 
itÕs going to be okay. 
(to dr. kuni) 
is it going to be fine? 
alison turns onto her back. 
dr. kuni 
itÕs going to be fine. okay? 
(to alison) 
youÕre going to feel a little bit of a 
push. 
dr. kuni tries to reposition the baby. 
ben 
what are you doing? 
dr. kuni 
iÕm turning the baby so i can take the 
pressure off the cord. 
alison 
oh, my god. 
the monitors stops beeping. 
knocked up - 127.
dr. kuni 
weÕre good. the heartbeatÕs stronger, 
but weÕre not out of the woods. we 
need to get things going now. i think 
the cord is wrapped around the neck. 
okay? 
ben 
what? 
dr. kuni 
so iÕm going to give you some 
medicine, pop the bag and get things 
going, okay? i donÕt want to leave the 
baby in there for long and we can give 
you some medicine for the pain. 
alison 
no, no, no, no. i donÕt want the baby 
to be born all drugged out. itÕs not 
my birth plan. 
dr. kuni 
now, things change. we donÕt have time 
to debate this. 
alison 
what? no. but no, iÕm not comfortable 
with that. iÕm not. 
ben 
no. would you please just listen to 
her? 
dr. kuni 
fine. do what you want to do. 
ben 
whoa, whoa, whoa, what? 
dr. kuni 
should i leave? do you want to be the 
doctor? because i really donÕt need to 
be here. 
ben 
no. what we want is to take a second 
to talk about our options, okay? 
thatÕs all we want. 
dr. kuni 
no. you mean you want to take a second 
to tell me how to do my job. my job is 
to get that baby out safely. or i can 
go home! you just let me know. you be 
the doctor. 
ben 
can we talk outside in the hall for a 
second?
