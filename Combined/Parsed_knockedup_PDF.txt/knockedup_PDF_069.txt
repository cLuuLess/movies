alison 
how many doctors are there in your 
practice? just because iÕm sort of 
looking for a more personal 
experience. i want to make sure that 
youÕre my doctor on the day and... 
dr. howard 
i understand. we have three other 
doctors in the practice but iÕm your 
man, okay? i donÕt take vacations. i 
hate hawaii. i went to the caribbean 
when i was fourteen and iÕm never 
going back. 
alison
