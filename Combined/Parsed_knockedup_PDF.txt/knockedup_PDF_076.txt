yeah, she was acting weird and i 
really think itÕs just because i 
havenÕt made an honest woman out of 
her. sheÕs carrying my bastard child. 
no one wants that. 
pete 
thatÕs what i did. i married debbie 
when she got pregnant. 
ben 
you think sheÕs, like, hiding me? 
like, sheÕs, like, embarrassed by me 
or something like that? 
pete 
probably. iÕd hide you. 
ben 
how much do wedding rings cost? 
pete 
it really depends, you know? i think 
youÕre supposed to spend three months 
pay on a ring. 
ben 
thatÕll be easy. i donÕt make any 
money. 
pete

money in porn.
