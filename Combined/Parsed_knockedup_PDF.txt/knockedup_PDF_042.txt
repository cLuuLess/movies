ben 
i know we didnÕt plan this and neither 
of us really thought it was gonna 
happen but life is like that, you 
know? you canÕt plan for it and even 
if we did, life doesnÕt care about 
your plans, necessarily, and you just 
kinda have to go with the flow and i 
just know my job is to just support 
you in whatever it is you wanna do. 
iÕm in, so whatever you wanna do, iÕm 
gonna do. 
alison weeps softly into the phone. 
ben(contÕd) 
iÕm on board. yaaay. 
alison 
i really appreciate you saying that. 
ben 
no problem. iÕll tell you, maybe if 
you could help me by telling me, like 
one thing that i am supposed to do, 
then that would be good, Ôcause i 
literally have no idea whatsoever. 
alison 
i have no idea either. 
ben

talk about it or something like that? 
alison
