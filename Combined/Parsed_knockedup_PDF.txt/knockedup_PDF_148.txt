int. hospital room 
dr. kuni and ben come back into the room. 
dr. kuni 
alison, i apologize for being a little 
brash, but if youÕre okay with it, 
itÕs rather important we break the bag 
and give you some medicine to speed 
things up. because once the bag is 
broken, i donÕt want there to be an 
infection. 
alison 
whatever. do what you have to do. 
dr. kuni exits. 
alison (contÕd) 
(whispering to ben) 
oh, my god. what a nightmare that guy 
is. 
knocked up - 129.
ben 
i know, i know. look, i talked to him. 
i think heÕll be more cool now. 
alison 
iÕm so sorry i broke up with you. 
ben 
you really donÕt need to be. and you 
know, i knew youÕd give me another 
shot. i figured itÕd be a lot sooner 
than this, you know? 
alison 
i was just in such a panic from all of 
this. and watching debbie and pete 
together, and my ass got so fat. 
ben 
no, no. 
alison 
it did. i just never, for one minute, 
thought that the guy who got me 
pregnant would actually be the right 
guy for me. 
ben 
me neither. 
alison 
i guess he is.
