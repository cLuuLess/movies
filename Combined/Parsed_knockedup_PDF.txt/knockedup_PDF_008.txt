int. benÕs house - day 
in a living room of the house the guys have created an office for 
their web site.  there are a few large tables, several computers 
which they work at, and a few tv sets which have movies running on 
them. ben and his friends are holding a meeting. they each have a 
note pad and pen, and jonah is on a computer. they smoke a joint 
and drink beers. 
jason 
all right? now, are you sure you 
understand the terms of the bet? 
Ôcause this is serious. 
martin 
oh, no. 
knocked up - 4.
jason 
martin, listen. you donÕt shave your 
beard or cut your hair for one year, 
and if you can do that, i will pay 
your rent. but if you shave, then you 
have to pay all five of our rents. 
martin 
thanks for the free money, bitch. 
jonah 
hey, martin, was it weird when you 
joined the taliban, being american and 
everything like that? like when you 
see a woman driving a car, do you just 
get pissed? 
jason

never know who your friends are. 
martin

whole time. 
jason

called Òthe dirty man competition.Ó 
weÕre gonna make fun of you until you 
shave the beard. thatÕs the rules. 
jay

supposed to be tempted into shaving. 
ben 
your face looks like robin williamsÕ 
knuckles. 
martin 
you guys arenÕt allowed to make fun of 
me. itÕs not part of the rules. 
jason 
martin, why didnÕt you just listen to 
me when i was explaining the rules? 
you just looked at me with that blank 
stare of yours. it was like talking to 
a wax statue. 
ben
