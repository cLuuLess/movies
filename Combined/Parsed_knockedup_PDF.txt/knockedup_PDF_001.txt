ext. ben√ïs house - day 
ben stone, 23, cute in a chunky jewish guy sort of way, boxes one 
of his roommates, martin. his other roommates, jay and jason fight 
with broom sticks. jonah drinks beer on the couch spectating. 
quick images: 
* we see ben and jay fighting. at one point they fight with gloves 
which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool. 
* ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head. 
there is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get 
cloudier and cloudier. he starts coughing hysterically and takes 
it off. 
*a boom box is playing.  the boys are now free style rapping.  it 
is terrible but they are having a blast.  pot is being smoked.  
beer is around.
