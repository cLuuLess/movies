int. debbie and pete's house, bathroom 
ben finds alison in a bubble bath surrounded by candles and 
soothing music. 
ben 
hello? alison. hello? 
alison 
ben? 
ben 
alison. what is this, like a water 
birth? what are we doing? should we 
go? 
alison 
shh! just relax, okay? just be mellow, 
because thatÕs what this is all about. 
because if it gets too stressful in 
here then the baby is born into a 
stressful environment and then heÕs 
wired for stress for the rest of his 
life. so just...just be calm. 
ben 
(whispering) 
okay. okay. letÕs relax. do you want 
to talk about things? i feel really 
bad about a lot of the shit i did. i 
canÕt believe i said some of that. 
thatÕs all i think about in my head. 
it-- 
alison 
i donÕt want to talk about it. 
ben 
but maybe we could bring the baby into 
a reconciled place so, we can talk-- 
knocked up - 120.
alison 
no. i donÕt want to go there. donÕt go 
there, okay? 
ben 
okay. 
alison 
help me stay relaxed. 
ben 
so, what should i do? 
alison 
you need to call dr. howard. 
ben goes into the hall and calls dr. howardÕs house.
