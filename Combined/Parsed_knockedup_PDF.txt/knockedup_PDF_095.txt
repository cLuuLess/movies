ext. fantasy baseball house 
pete and debbie are in the driveway while alison and ben watch 
from the street. 
knocked up - 87.
pete 
i should have told you. 
debbie 
what else have you been lying about? 
pete 
nothing. 
ben 
(to alison) 
that guy said, ÒdonÕt let the door hit 
you in the vagina on the way out.Ó 
debbie 
where were you on wednesday? 
pete 
iÕm going to be honest with you. 
alison 
(to ben) 
yeah, i heard him. 
ben 
(to alison) 
that was hilarious. 
debbie 
that would be a good idea. 
pete 
youÕve been mad because iÕve been 
working so much and i didnÕt want to 
upset you. 
debbie 
i wouldnÕt be mad. 
pete 
you would be. 
debbie 
i donÕt get mad. 
pete 
itÕs a fantasy baseball draft. iÕm not 
cheating or anything. 
debbie 
no, this is worse. 
pete 
how is this worse? 
debbie 
this is you wanting to be with your 
friends more than your family. 
pete 
look, the reason i make that up is 
because if i told you what i was 
really doing, you would just get mad. 
so, you think iÕm seeing a band, i do 
my fantasy draft, and itÕs win/win. 
knocked up - 88.
debbie 
well, what did you do last wednesday 
night when you said you went to see a 
band? 
pete 
i went to the movies. 
debbie 
with who? 
pete 
by myself. 
debbie 
whatÕd you see? 
pete 
Òspiderman three.Ó 
debbie 
why do you want to go by yourself? why 
didnÕt you ask me to go? 
pete 
because i needed to get away, you 
know? with work and you and the kids, 
sometimes i just need some time to 
myself. 
debbie 
i need time for myself. i want time 
for myself, too. 
debbie holds back tears. 
debbie (contÕd) 
youÕre not the only one. 
pete 
itÕs not that big of a deal. 
debbie 
(through tears) 
i like spiderman. 
pete 
okay, so letÕs see Òspiderman threeÓ 
next week. 
debbie 
i donÕt want to go see it now. 
pete 
well... 
debbie 
i donÕt want to have to ask you to ask 
me. i want you to just come up with it 
on your own. 
pete 
what? i donÕt even know what to say. 
uh, what do you want me to do? 
knocked up - 89.
debbie 
you just think because you donÕt yell 
that youÕre not mean, but this is 
mean. 
pete 
iÕm not being mean. iÕm being honest. 
youÕre telling me i need to be honest. 
just-- 
debbie 
no, youÕre not. youÕre lying. 
pete 
iÕm doing it because i need to keep my 
sanity a little bit. 
debbie 
you know what? i donÕt want you at the 
house anymore. okay? 
pete 
come on. 
debbie heads for the car. 
ben 
oh, shit, sheÕs coming back. 
i/e alison car - day 
alison drives to the gynecologist with ben. 
ben 
how come we go to the gynecologist so 
often? i bet we have to go so much so 
we can pay for that three-hundred- 
thousand-dollar machine he has. 
alison 
i cannot stop thinking about what an 
asshole pete is. 
ben 
thatÕs a little strong, i would say. 
alison 
really? because that had to be one of 
the most selfish things iÕve ever 
witnessed. 
ben 
itÕs understandable. i even think itÕs 
kind of funny. 
alison 
whatÕs funny about it? 
ben 
well, you wonÕt laugh now, i wouldnÕt 
imagine, but you know, the situation. 
knocked up - 90. 
(more)
we break into this strangerÕs house 
thinking weÕre going to find him 
sleeping with a woman, and then itÕs a 
bunch of nerds playing fantasy 
baseball.if you saw that on 
television, you would laugh. 
alison 
is that what you think? 
ben 
yeah. 
alison 
is that what you want to do, ben? 
ben 
i donÕt even like baseball. iÕm just 
saying when youÕre a guy and you have 
a family and you have responsibility, 
you lose that male camaraderie, and i 
get that. i totally understand where 
heÕs coming from. 
alison 
why do you guys always go to that 
place? you miss male camaraderie. what 
do i give a shit? go hang out with 
your bearded freak friends. i donÕt 
care. you want to hang out with guys 
that look like the shoe bomber, itÕs 
all on you, man. 
ben 
well what the fuck am i supposed to 
say to that? 
alison 
you should just support me! you know, 
you should just support everything i 
say because at this juncture in my 
life, iÕm allowed to be wrong! 
ben 
so if youÕre wrong, i have to support 
it? 
alison 
yes! 
ben 
i canÕt tell you that youÕre acting 
like a lunatic? 
alison 
oh, thatÕs helpful. you have to do 
nothing! 
ben 
iÕve sacrificed a lot of shit to this! 
alison 
you are just fucking sitting there! 
you havenÕt sacrificed anything! 
knocked up - 91. 
ben (cont'd)
ben 
i have. 
alison 
iÕve had to sacrifice my job, my body, 
my youth, my vagina! 
ben 
youÕve sacrificed your vagina? 
alison 
yes! it will never look the same after 
this! 
ben 
well. fine. iÕll pay for vaginal 
reconstructive surgery. 
alison 
you canÕt pay for shit! you can barely 
buy spaghetti. 
ben 
youÕre right. fine! 
alison 
you know what? get out of the car. 
ben 
oh! you know what? why donÕt you not 
threaten me?! 
alison 
you should just get out of the fucking 
car. 
ben 
iÕm not going to get out of the car in 
the middle of nowhere! no! 
alison 
get out of the car. 
ben 
no! 
alison 
i own this car! get out of my car! 
ben 
no. 
alison 
get out of my car! 
ben 
no. 
alison 
(yelling) 
get out of my fucking car! 
ben gets out of the car and immediately knocks on the window. 
knocked up - 92.
ben 
can you let me back in the car, 
please? have you calmed down? did you 
take a breath? i have no clue where we 
are! 
alison just glares at him. 
ben (contÕd) 
fine. go. great. 
alison drives off.
