alison and ben stand while kissing. 
ben 
at least we donÕt have to use a 
condom, you know? 
alison pulls away. 
ben (contÕd) (contÕd) 
but we can. i brought some just in 
case. i donÕt have v.d. or anything. i 
mean, i donÕt, i thought-- 
alison 
itÕs not that. 
ben 
itÕs just i thought we could get a 
little...fun out of your situation, 
you know? 
alison 
okay, first of all, itÕs not my 
situation. itÕs our situation. 
ben 
i know that. 
alison 
and just because iÕm pregnant, iÕm not 
some ruined woman and all romance goes 
out the door. 
ben 
iÕm sorry. i like you a lot. thatÕs 
all this is. 
alison 
i like you, too. 
knocked up - 53.
ben 
sweet. 
alison 
a little, so far. i mean, we have 
seven months before the baby comes. we 
donÕt have to rush it. 
ben 
yeah. 
alison 
we should really just try to get to 
know each other and...give this a real 
shot. you know? we got ourselves into 
this situation. we kind of have to. 
ben 
for the baby, right? 
alison 
exactly. okay, if this was our second 
date, what would you do? 
ben 
b.j. if iÕm just being honest. i told 
my roommates that i thought i was 
gonna get a b.j., so... 
alison 
you know what? for the sake of getting 
to know one another, can you not talk 
like that? 
ben 
i can do that. iÕm really nervous. 
alison 
iÕm nervous, too. iÕm really nervous. 
ben 
yeah. 
ben and alison kiss. 
alison 
youÕre a sweet guy, right? 
ben 
i think i am. 
alison 
donÕt fuck me over, okay? 
ben 
i wouldnÕt do that. just so you know, 
iÕm the guy girls fuck over. iÕm that 
guy. so you donÕt fuck me over, okay? 
alison 
okay. 
ben 
i couldnÕt take it. i canÕt raise this 
baby alone.
