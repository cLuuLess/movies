int. dr. howardÕs office - later 
alison stands on a scale while dr. howardÕs nurse weighs her. 
alison 
you know what? maybe i should take my 
shoes off. or my belt buckle. my belt 
buckleÕs huge. 
dr. howardÕs nurse 
donÕt worry about gaining weight. your 
baby wants you to gain a whole mess of 
weight. 
ben walks into the room, winded. 
alison 
(to ben) 
are you fucking kidding me? 
ben 
why donÕt you take off your earrings, 
too? they weigh about eighty pounds. 
theyÕre made out of moon rocks arenÕt 
they? 
alison 
do not make fun of me. okay? i am 
hormonal, i am terrified, and i am 
falling apart, so stop treating 
everything like itÕs a big joke! 
ben 
iÕm sorry youÕre freaking out, but i 
just walked three fucking miles 
through koreatown to get here. sorry 
if iÕm trying to lighten the mood a 
little. 
the nurse leaves. 
alison 
well, donÕt! okay?! you canÕt take 
anything seriously! you didnÕt even 
read the baby books. 
ben 
i didnÕt read the baby books! whatÕs 
gonna happen? how did anyone ever give 
birth without a baby book?! 
knocked up - 93. 
(more)
thatÕs right, the ancient egyptians 
fucking engraved Òwhat to expect when 
youÕre expectingÓ on the pyramid 
walls! i forgot about that! who gives 
a flying fuck about the baby books?! 
alison 
it just shows your lack of commitment, 
ben! that youÕre not in this with me! 
ben 
did you just say my lack of 
commitment? because thatÕs what it 
sounded like. it almost seems as 
though you forgot i proposed to you 
like an asshole! and you said no to 
me! 
alison 
if you feel that way, you should just 
go. really. just go. because we didnÕt 
mean to do this together, okay? and, 
and we tried to make it work and that 
was good, i suppose. 
alison holds back tears. 
alison (contÕd) 
but it doesnÕt work. because we are 
two completely different people. and i 
think it would just be easier for both 
of us if we stop fooling ourselves. 
ben 
you know what? i know this isnÕt you 
talking, itÕs your hormones, but i 
would just like to say, Òfuck you, 
hormones! you are a crazy bitch, 
hormones! not alison! hormones!Ó fuck 
them. itÕs a girl. buy some pink shit! 
alison 
nice. you are such an asshole. you 
know what? go fuck your fucking bong, 
you fuck! 
ben 
i will fuck my bong. doggie-style, for 
once. 
ben exits while giving alison the finger as her walks away. dr. 
howardÕs nurse returns. 
dr. howardÕs nurse 
are you ready? 
alison 
iÕm really sorry about all that. that 
was really inappropriate. 
dr. howardÕs nurse 
thatÕs okay. it happens all the time 
here. itÕs fine. 
knocked up - 94. 
ben (cont'd)
alison 
i donÕt feel so stupid, then. 
dr. howardÕs nurse 
not at all.
