angle. i can feel you looking at my 
chins. 
ben

skinny.

theyÕre flopping around. i can feel it 
and itÕs distracting. itÕs all 
national geographic. 
ben 
(whispering) 
do you want to do it doggie style? 
alison 
no. i do not want you to fuck me like 
a dog. 
ben 
iÕm not fucking you like a dog. itÕs 
doggie style. itÕs just the style. 
iÕm, itÕs not like a dog. we donÕt 
have to go outside or anything. 
ben and alison lie down side by side, ben is behind.

kick. 
alison

ben 
this was a bad kick. 
alison 
itÕs fine! itÕs fine! 
ben 
look. my dick must be like an inch 
away from its face and itÕs coming, 
just coming in at its face. what if it 
kicked because it didnÕt like it? i 
canÕt do that to our baby. thatÕs the 
first thing itÕs going to see. 
alison 
what are you talking about? 
ben 
itÕs having the baby between us, it 
just makes it weird. iÕm sorry. it 
just freaks me out a bit. itÕs a 
little weird. 
alison 
i have totally lost it now. 
ben 
youÕve totally lost it? 
alison 
iÕve lost it. 
ben

alison

alison turns her back to ben and gets settled to sleep. 
alison (contÕd) 
(holding back tears)

again. 
ben
