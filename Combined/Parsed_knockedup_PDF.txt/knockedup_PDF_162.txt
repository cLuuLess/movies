ext. hospital - day 
ben and a nurse push alison and the baby in a wheelchair. 
i/e alisonÕs car 
ben drives while alison and the baby are in the back seat. 
alison 
i hope your apartmentÕs big enough for 
the three of us. 
ben 
it definitely is. thatÕs why i got one 
in east la. the rent. itÕs huge! the 
only thing is we have to decide if 
weÕre going to be crips or bloods 
before we get there. 
alison 
well, i look good in red. 
knocked up - 138.
ben 
i look good in blue. the fighting 
continues. we could just throw off 
everyone and become latin kings. 
alison 
yeah. 
ben 
we both look good in gold. 
alison 
good choice. i would yell at you about 
driving so slow, except the babyÕs 
here. 
ben 
no, these guys can honk all they want. 
i ainÕt going faster than twelve. it 
might take us around three hours to 
get home, though. 
the car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting 
behind them. 
fade out. 
knocked up - 139.
