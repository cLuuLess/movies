shower scenes! why didnÕt you think of 
that, jay! 
jay

martin 
well shit. i saw it online at one 
point, but i guess i didnÕt connect 
the dots. 
jonah

ben 
all we need to do is think of a new, 
better idea that no one else has 
thought of already.

out. 
jonah, jason and martin exit. ben and jay sit at the desk.

exists doesnÕt mean ours wonÕt work. 
good things come in pairs.
