int. cirque du soleil 
ben and pete watch from the crowd as acrobats climb poles. 
ben and pete 
ohhhhhh! 
ben 
this was a great idea, man. 
pete 
this is the best idea iÕve ever had in 
my life. 
two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each 
other. 
ben 
what are they going to do? what in the 
world are they doing? if i shaved my 
stomach and my chest, i would look 
exactly like that. those guys are at 
work right now. 
(imitating one of the 
acrobats) 
whatÕd you do today? oh, just lifted 
my brother. 
the crowd starts to applaud for the acrobats. 
ben (contÕd) 
no! donÕt applaud! heÕll fall! iÕm 
freaking out right now, man! 
many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage. 
ben (contÕd) 
the mushrooms are turning on me! 
a clown dressed as a giant baby is part of the act. ben yells 
frantically. 
giant baby 
papa. 
ben 
i am not your papa. 
a giant snail comes out onto the stage. 
ben (contÕd) 
i canÕt deal with this shit, man! 
ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit. 
knocked up - 102.
