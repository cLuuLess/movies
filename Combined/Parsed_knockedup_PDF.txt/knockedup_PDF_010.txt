had a little debate on the conference 
call with new york about you. 
alison 
you were talking about me? 
jack 
we were wondering aloud to one another 
whether or not you would be good for 
on-camera. 
alison

jill 
they decided that they like you. and 
they would like to put you on camera. 
alison

jack 
iÕll take that smile as a Òyes, iÕll 
do it.Ó 
alison 
absolutely. iÕm so excited. oh, my 
god. 
jill 
itÕs a lot of work. canÕt wait to see 
what happens. itÕs going to be tough. 
tough job. 
jack 
about the work, most immediately, 
thereÕs going to be some things that 
youÕre going to be able to get that 
other people in the office donÕt get. 
one of them: gym membership. 
alison 
you want me to lose weight? 
jack 
i donÕt want you to lose weight. 
jill 
we canÕt legally ask you to do that. 
jack 
we didnÕt say lose weight. 
jill 
no. 
jack 
i might say Òtighten.Ó 
alison 
Òtight.Ó 
jack 
a little...tighter? 
jill 
just like toned and smaller. 
jack 
donÕt make everything smaller. i donÕt 
want to generalize that way. tighter. 
jill 
we donÕt want you to lose weight. we 
just want you to be healthy. 
knocked up - 9.
alison 
okay. 
jill 
you know, by, by eating less. we would 
just like it if you...go home and step 
on the scale and write down how much 
you weigh and subtract it by, like, 
twenty. 
alison 
twenty. 
jill 
and then weigh that much. 
jack 
just remember, youÕve got it here, 
youÕve got it here, and everybodyÕs 
going see you right there.
