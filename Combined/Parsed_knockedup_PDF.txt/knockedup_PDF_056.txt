sadie 
so he came over for breakfast because 
heÕs your new boyfriend? 
debbie 
he came from his house, drove over to 
our house because he thought it would 
be fun to have breakfast with us, so 
he drove his car from his house to our 
house to have breakfast. 
pete 
because he likes breakfast so much. 
charlotte 
i love breakfast. 
ben 
you guys wanna hear something neat? 
weÕre gonna have a baby together. 
sadie 
what? 
ben 
yeah, a baby. 
sadie 
well, youÕre not married. arenÕt you 
supposed to be married to have a baby? 
knocked up - 55.
pete 
you donÕt have to be. 
debbie 
but they should be because they love 
each other and people who love each 
other get married and have babies. 
sadie 
where do babies come from? 
debbie 
where do you think they come from? 
sadie 
well, i think a stork, he drops it 
down, and then, a hole goes in your 
body and thereÕs blood everywhere, 
coming out of your head, and then you 
push your belly-button, and then your 
butt falls off and then you hold you 
butt and you have to dig and you find 
a little baby. 
debbie 
thatÕs exactly right.
