               int. broomÂ´s office - night

               myers stands by broom's desk as the old man places a new set 
               of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank.

                                     myers
                         i'm in way over my head, i know that 
                         much.

                                     broom
                         you're doing fine.

               at the last book stand, broom glances at abe, who is sitting 
               in the shadows near the door.

                                     myers
                         no, i'm not. he respects clay. not 
                         me. i don't know why you chose me, 
                         sir. but i'm not qualified.

               discouraged, myers heads for the door.

                                     broom
                              (very quiet)
                         i'm dying agent myers.

               shocked, myers looks over at broom.

                                     broom
                         and as a father, i worry about him.
                              (directly to myers)
                         in medieval stories, agent myers, 
                         there's often a young knight, 
                         inexperienced but pure of heart...

                                     myers
                         oh, please. i'm not "pure of heart."

                                     abe
                         yes, you are.

                                     broom
                         what i ask from you is -- have the 
                         courage to stand by his side after 
                         i'm gone. help him find himself. who 
                         he must be.
                              (beat)
                         he was born a demon... you will help 
                         him become a man.

               omit
