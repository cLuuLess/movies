               int. inside the cargo box - day

               hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark.

                                     liz's voice
                              (on radio)
                         we're leaving the main road, so hang 
                         on --

               they hit a series of bumps. the box rattles and shakes. 
               hellboy bangs his head. the vehicle lurches to a halt.

                                     hellboy
                              (on the radio)
                         this better be the place or i'll 
                         puke.

               motors are turned off. the crate is opened. liz peeks in.

                                     liz
                         come out and see.
