               int. tunnel labyrinth (set) - day

               clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. the glow 
               of hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his 
               booming footsteps rapidly receding. a veritable labyrinth.

                                     clay
                         damn it, red.
