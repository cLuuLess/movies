               ext. abbey ruins - altar area - night

               grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.  
               even the skeptical von krupt is in thrall.

               the nazi scientist reaches for a second gold cylinder. but 
               something else lands next to him: a grenade!!!

               the explosion blows him to pieces. in a few seconds, the 
               squad of allies storms the area.

               a hail of bullets cuts down a dozen nazis. the allies overrun 
               the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.

               von krupt shoots wildly, hitting broom in the leg. but 
               whitman's bullets rip into the old nazi's chest.

               leaving a trail of blood, broom crawls to a dead g.i. and 
               grabs a grenade from his belt.

               tchkkk!!! kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel 
               bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, 
               mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. 
               the steel chops clean through their weapons.

               broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.

               click-clack!! it wedges itself between two moving tie rods.

               kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after 
               it. the gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. as 
               his fingers reach the grenade, it explodes!!!

               kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where 
               two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.

               another rail plunges -- fffft!!, like a javelin -- into the 
               earth right next to matlin.

                                     ilsa
                         grigory!
