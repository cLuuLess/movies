               int. hellboy's den - day

               inside, hellboy is leaning over broom, glaring at the old 
               man.

                                     hellboy
                         how many buildings does she have to 
                         burn? she belongs here!

                                     broom
                         that's not how she feels. she may 
                         never feel it.

               myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. they ignore 
               him.

                                     broom
                         it's her choice --
                              (beat)
                         she's human --

                                     hellboy
                         oh, as opposed to -- ?

               broom grows silent.

               hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held 
               belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. sparks fly every 
               time he goes at the round stumps.

                                     hellboy
                         mmmh -- "pamcakes." we're going out --

                                     myers
                         professor, that girl you were talking 
                         about --

                                     hellboy
                              (whirls around)
                         hey. you: think twice --

                                     myers
                         i think i can help -- talk to her -- 
                         i can bring her back.

                                     hellboy
                              (chuckles)
                         what landed you this job, pushing 
                         "pamcakes"? punctuality? what was 
                         your area of expertise?

               myers murmurs --

                                     hellboy
                         what was that??

                                     myers
                         hostage negotiations.

               hellboy's face lights up.
