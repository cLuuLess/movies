               ext. west side street - night

               sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps 
               straight into the street. cars swerve, avoiding a collision 
               as sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. the trick or 
               treaters scream.

               hellboy appears. he too dives straight into the traffic as 
               myers follows --

               he runs into the road... and a 4x4 speeds straight at him!

               seeing this, hellboy runs back, and lands next to myers, 
               holds out his stone hand and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.

               the impact somersaults the car over them both. it lands with 
               a thud on the street, air bags exploding. myers almost faints.

               other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. a major 
               traffic jam.

                                     hellboy
                         are you okay?

               myers opens his eyes, nods.

                                     hellboy
                         good. stay here.

               he moves after sammael.
