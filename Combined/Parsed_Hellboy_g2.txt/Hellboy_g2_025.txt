               ext. inside the church - back to '44 - night

                                     broom
                              (smiles at the creature)
                         hellboy.

               inside the blanket, hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes 
               and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily.

                                                                    cut to:

               hellboy - main title

               montage: tabloid covers and news clippings screaming hellboy 
               sighting in reno!! government denial!!! etc.

               tv newscasters read lurid copy. springer excerpts (fist fight 
               included) feature the show's theme: i was hellboy's bride!!

               some blurry, grainy footage depicts hellboy crossing an alley. 
               much like bigfoot in the woods.

                                     tom manning (v.o.)
                         look at that. that's a costume. these 
                         people amaze me.
