               int. center of the tunnel labyrinth (set) - day

               clay stumbles around, lost. he stops under a grate.

                                     hellboy's voice
                              (on the walkie-talkie)
                         who's there? clay? come in, someone.

                                     clay
                         clay, code 30, this is clay, over...

               behind clay, kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through 
               shafts of gray light. he brings forth his customary long 
               blade. clay turns in time to see kroenen coming at him. he 
               fires. kroenen stabs.

               twin rivulets of blood run from clay's nostrils.
