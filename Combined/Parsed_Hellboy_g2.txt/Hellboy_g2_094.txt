               int. hospital - liz's room, min. security ward - night

               a flashlight beam sweeps liz's room. it illuminates a 
               corkboard covered with hundreds of polaroids depicting scenes 
               of everyday life.

               when the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, 
               still asleep.

               as the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. 
               grigory emerges from a dark corner. he gazes down on the 
               bed, extending his right hand.

               he gently caresses the scar on her forehead. under his skin, 
               a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. his 
               fingers start to glow.

                                     grigory
                         ...dream of fire.

               liz convulses. a small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.

                                                             flash back to:
