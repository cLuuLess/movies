               int. tunnel "b" - underground narrow tunnel - day

               a narrow tunnel. liz and myers advance carefully.

               just ahead, a cave-in. pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins 
               and corpses form a chaotic barrier. as they squeeze past...

                                     myers
                         so, he thinks that you and i... that's 
                         why he's mad at me --

               a few bones roll by. wet earth drops onto their shoulders. 
               they draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their 
               flashlight beams straight down. a moment of strange intimacy.

                                     myers
                         but it's not true, is it?

                                     liz
                         what -- ?

                                     myers
                         that you feel that way about me.

                                     liz
                         you want to know -- now -- ? here? 
                         red, white, whatever -- guys are all 
                         the same.
