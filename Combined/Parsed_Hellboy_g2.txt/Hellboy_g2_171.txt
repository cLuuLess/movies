               as the plane engines drone, myers supervises bprd agents 
               lime and stone, who stencil a large crate: fragile! live 
               cargo.

                         "one falls, two shall arise." so: 
                         you pop one, two come out. you kill 
                         two, you get four. you kill four, 
                         you're in trouble. we have to nail 
                         'em all at once. and the eggs.

                         we've installed a very handy timer. 
                         set it, walk away. cable pulls the 
                         safety pins, k-boom! easy to clean, 
                         easy to use...

                              (interrupts)
                         those things never work. never.
