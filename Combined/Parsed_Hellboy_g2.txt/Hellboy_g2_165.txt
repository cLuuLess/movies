                         we've collected and destroyed 
                         thousands of eggs. no trace of this 
                         "sammael" or this "rasputin" 
                         character. but we have this address --

               in a meeting room, manning stands at a polished obsidian 
               desk. a group of agents -- myers among them -- listens 
               attentively.

                         leave as soon as we get clearance
