               dozens of hellboy clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along 
               with intimate images of hellboy as a kid. h.b. at 7, at 12, 
               dressed as a human for halloween, broom by his side.

               myers works at a computer workstation.

               he brings up a small photograph in an old issue of the 
               enquirer. the headline: "arson suspect now working for secret 
               government agency" there's a photo of a woman, taken with a 
               telephoto lens.

               another clipping: young liz, 11, and a photo of a tenement 
               building burned to the ground: tragic explosion.

               a quicktime interview pops up. liz, in her early twenties. a 
               caption reads: elizabeth sherman, first interview, bprd, 
               pyrokinetic. she has a polaroid camera in her hands. shoots 
               one at the lens.

                         i don't like the term "firestarter." 
                         i just don't. and "pyrokinesis" sounds 
                         like psychosis or something. i dunno -- 
                         maybe that's right. not being able 
                         to let go --
                              (shrug)
                         scary. sometimes you hear so-and-so 
                         lost control and just exploded.
                              (beat)
                         they're lucky it isn't true.
                              (looks at the camera)
                         with me -- it is.
