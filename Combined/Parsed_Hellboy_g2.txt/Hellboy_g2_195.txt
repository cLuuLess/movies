               int. above the hexagonal trap door pit - day

               kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. he can't hear a sound.

               as he peeks -- swish!! a loop of the rope wraps around his 
               neck and yanks him forward! before he goes over, he 
               frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.
