               int. beam tunnel area - benjamin institute - day

               an explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes 
               through a dank tunnel. then, light beams sweep the encrusted 
               walls and steel columns.

               clay and some b.p.r.d. agents hold flashlights. two of them -- 
               moss and quarry -- carry flamethrowers.

               hellboy and abe bring up the rear.
