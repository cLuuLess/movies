               ext. behind the altar - night

               the lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone 
               saints. grigory, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully 
               extended.

                                     grigory
                         no matter what happens to me, you 
                         must carry on with the work.

               ilsa, a severe, ageless aryan beauty, reverentially drapes 
               an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.

                                     ilsa
                         i will not leave you.

                                     grigory
                         yes, you will... leave me. deny me.

                                     ilsa
                         never --

               he hands her a small leather-bound book. it contains hand-
               drawn notes and illustrations.

                                     grigory
                         this will guide you back to me.

               he pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.

                                     grigory
                         i grant you everlasting life, youth 
                         and the power to serve me.

               he dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then 
               wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation 
               and a ritual.

               von krupt, an acrid german general, wearing dark scarlet 
               glasses and leather gloves, appears. looks at his pocket 
               watch. on the gold lid: a swastika.

                                     von krupt
                         it's time.
