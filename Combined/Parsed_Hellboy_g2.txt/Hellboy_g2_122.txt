               hellboy stands in kroenen's quarters. an array of gas masks 
               dangle from ducts overhead. glued next to the walls are dozens 
               of old photos of children.

               he discovers the sammael engraving.

                                     hellboy
                         "sammael: seed of destruction. death 
                         becomes the fertile ground."

               suddenly: drool drops from above: sammael hangs from a beam.

                                     hellboy
                              (turning)
                         didn't i kill you already?

               sammael lunges, hurling hellboy through an open service 
               shaft...

               ...and it's a long way down.

               when sammael leaps, hellboy throws him over the edge. sammael, 
               however, grabs hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.
