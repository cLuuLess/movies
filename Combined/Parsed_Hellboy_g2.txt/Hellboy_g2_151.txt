               ext. building rooftop - night

               two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. cursing, 
               hellboy hauls himself up. he finds himself next to a pigeon 
               coop where a young kid is feeding the birds.

                                     hellboy
                         hi...

               the kid stares at him.

                                     kid
                         you're hellboy.

                                     hellboy
                         shh. i'm... on a mission.

               he watches as liz and myers sit on the bench.

                                     hellboy
