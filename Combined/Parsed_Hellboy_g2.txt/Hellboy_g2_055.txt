               int. "magik exhibition" hall - night

               sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. part of the 
               neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble 
               and criss- crossed with blue veins.

                                     hellboy
                         hold it --
                              (beat)
                         hey, sammy, whaddayasay we work this 
                         out?? peacefully. i'm not a great 
                         shot, but --
                              (raises his gun)
                         "the samaritan" here, uses really 
                         big bullets, so whadyasay we work 
                         this out?

               sammael stands and turns around -- crack-kkk!!! his waist 
               twists him 360 degrees!!

               screeching, sammael leaps away!!!

               hellboy shoots. the high-caliber ammo rips a few columns 
               apart and finally catches sammael. the bullet goes through 
               it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. the 
               monster squeals and goes down. with a rattling cough, it 
               grows still.

               omit
