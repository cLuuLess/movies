               int. broomÂ´s office (full aquarium)- dusk

               myers looks around, fascinated: books. an office made of 
               them. the soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes 
               everything in an intimate, warm light.

               one entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge 
               tank of water. a voice crackles through an intercom next to 
               the tank.

                                     voice
                         turn the pages, please.

               myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.

                                     voice
                         over here... if you don't mind?

               in the tank, abe sapien, a fish-man glides in and out view.

                                     myers
                         jesus christ!

               myers looks at four book stands facing the glass. each 
               supports an open volume. he leans close to the glass, peering 
               intently.

               abe reappears. he is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns 
               streaking his soft skin. bright blue eyes shine with 
               intelligence. behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are 
               bubbling.

                                     myers
                              (points at the books)
                         these -- ? you're reading these -- ?

               abe nods. through a side door, broom enters.

                                     broom
                         four books at once. every day -- as 
                         long as i'm here to turn the pages.
                              (smiles)
                         my name's broom. professor trevor 
                         broom.

               myers extends his hand in greeting --

                                     myers
                         sir, i'm --

               bam! abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes 
               his eyes -- all three lids.

               abe's voice surges from the speaker.

                                     abe
                         agent john t. myers, kansas city, 
                         76. "t" stands for thaddeus, mother's 
                         older brother. scar on your chin 
                         happened when you were ten, you still 
                         wonder if it's ever going to fade 
                         away.

                                     myers
                         how did it --

                                     broom
                         -- he. not "it."

                                     broom
                         abraham sapien. discovered alive in 
                         a secret chamber at st. trinian's 
                         foundling hospital, washington.

               points at a small piece of antique paper, framed on the wall.

                                     broom
                         they took his name from this little 
                         inscription that was stuck on his 
                         tank.

                                     myers
                              (reads)
                         icthyo sapiens, april 14, 1865.

                                     broom
                         the day abraham lincoln died. hence 
                         "abe" sapien.

               broom uncovers a tray by the tank: four greenish eggs. myers 
               gags and reels back.

                                     broom
                         rotten eggs, a delicacy. abe loves 
                         them.

               abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow, gracefully nabbing 
               the eggs as they float through the hatch.

                                     myers
                         how does he know so much about me?

                                     broom
                         abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
                              (beat)
                         "unique." that's a word you'll hear 
                         quite a bit around here.

                                     myers
                         where am i -- exactly, sir?

                                     broom
                         as you entered the lobby there was 
                         an inscription --

                                     myers
                         on the desk, yes. in latin.

                                     broom
                         impressive. do you remember what it 
                         said?

                                     myers
                              (sighs)
                         "in absentia luci, tenebrae 
                         vinciunt..." 

                                     broom
                         "in the absence of light, darkness 
                         prevails." for there are things that 
                         go bump in the night, agent myers.
                              (smiles)
                         we are the ones who bump back.
