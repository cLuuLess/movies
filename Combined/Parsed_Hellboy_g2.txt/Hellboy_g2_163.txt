               ext. bprd building - day

               it's raining like hell.

               the pallbearers, manning and myers among them, load broom's 
               casket into a hearse. flanking it are two rows of bprd agents.

               the hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.

               watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: hellboy. rain 
               bounces off his wet overcoat.

               liz observes him, worried.

                                     liz's voice
                         he hasn't spoken to anyone in three 
                         days. not a word. he doesn't eat, he 
                         doesn't sleep...
