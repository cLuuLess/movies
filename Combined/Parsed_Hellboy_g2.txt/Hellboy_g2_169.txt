                         twenty tons of stone. this thing 
                         fell from the sky into tungaska 
                         forest.

                         june 30th, 1908. it burned hundreds 
                         of square miles of forest. the 
                         romanovs took possession of it 
                         immediately. the czar guarded it 
                         jealously -- i have wanted it for 
                         ages.

               grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. at 
               the center --

               -- two circular imprints that match hellboy's four-fingered 
               stone hand.

                         you are aware, of course, there's no 
                         way you'll get it out of russian 
                         territory.

                         it's a pleasure doing business with 
                         you. perhaps you have other interests.

               grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.
