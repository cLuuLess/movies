               int. ice cave - central labyrinth area - day

               at the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in 
               grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.

               figure 3 uncovers his face: he's a peasant guide.

                                     peasant guide
                              (in romanian)
                         we shouldn't be here --

               figure 1 exchanges a meaningful look with figure 2. figure 1 
               throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the sherpa. on 
               them, an embossed swastika. after a greedy moment of thought, 
               the peasant kneels to pick up the gold.

               tchkk!!! a long, shiny blade pierces the peasant's chest 
               from behind. he blinks twice and slumps forward.

               figure 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in 
               his hand.

               the figures uncover their faces. ilsa has not aged and 
               kroenen, still wears the same tight gas mask. he cleans his 
               blade in the snow and takes back the gold.

               ilsa watches the sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming 
               rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

               a figure rises from the blood. a naked human shape, haloed 
               by fireflies.

                                     ilsa
                         your eyes. what did they do to your 
                         eyes?

                                                                    cut to:
