               ext. n.y. - manhattan street - day

               leaves stir on the pavement. all the stores are decorated 
               for halloween. two kids dressed as skeletons run in front of 
               broom, carrying a jack-o-lantern.

               leaning on a cane, broom exits the building and walks toward 
               a waiting black mercedes. the driver (agent lime) opens the 
               door.

               broom pauses to buy a dozen baby ruth candy bars from a street 
               vendor.

               in an electronics store, a wall of tv's. the image of a red, 
               blurry shape (hellboy) fills the screens.
