               int. b.p.r.d. lobby - day

               seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. myers 
               approaches.

                                     myers
                         hello, i'm --

                                     lobby guard
                         -- late. five minutes late.

                                     myers
                         yes, i --

                                     lobby guard
                         -- section fifty-one. step back.

                                     myers
                         pardon?

                                     lobby guard
                         two steps back, please.

               confused, myers picks up his suitcases and complies. he 
               realizes he's dead center on a giant b.p.r.d. logo: a hand 
               holding a sword.

                                     lobby guard
                         watch your hands and elbows.

               immediately, the floor under myers' feet starts down. he's 
               on a small elevator.
