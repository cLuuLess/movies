               ext. building rooftop - night

               the pigeons flutter on the rooftop.

               the pigeon kid sits by hellboy's side.

                                     kid
                         just go down there and tell her how 
                         you feel!
                              (hellboy shakes his 
                              head: no)
                         my mom says --

                                     hellboy
                         it's not that easy, okay?
                              (beat)
                         plus, you're nine. you're not old 
                         enough to give me advice.

                                     kid
                              (shrugs)
                         who are those guys??

               hellboy turns and sees --

               two of the black b.p.r.d. sedan cars rounds the corner.

               agent lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing myers, 
               talking rapidly. liz screams, covers her ears.

                                     hellboy
                         something's wrong --

               omit
