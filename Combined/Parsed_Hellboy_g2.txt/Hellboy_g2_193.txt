               int.  hexagonal stone lab - day

               hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. 
               manning moves along behind him.

               the record finishes playing. silence --

               swish!!! kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping 
               into manning's arm. as kroenen goes in for the kill -- 

               -- hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. kroenen 
               bears down but hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate 
               blocks.

               kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.

                                     hellboy
                         screw that.

               hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. bammmm!!!! 
               he punches kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, 
               smashing its lenses.

                                     hellboy
                         you killed my father --

               bammm!!!! another hit.

               kroenen staggers back with each blow. finally, the mask falls 
               off.

                                     hellboy
                         give your soul to god, your ass is 
                         mine.

               an asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. kroenen is 
               laughing.
