               int. b.p.r.d. - main hall area - day

               a new space. office corridors radiate out from a brass 
               b.p.r.d. logo on the floor. a few agents monitor computer 
               stations and tactical glass boards.

               liz and myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. she looks 
               around and sees broom coming down the hall.

                                     broom
                         welcome back.

                                     liz
                         it's only for the weekend, professor 
                         broom. then i'll be on my way --

                                     broom
                              (impeccable courtesy)
                         come and go as you please.
                              (beat)
                         find your way back. we've made quite 
                         a few changes --

               crash!!! liz screams and myers draws his gun. smashing through 
               a glass partition, the mangled steel locker lands in the 
               middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.

               next, manning appears, retreating but unharmed.

                                     manning
                              (gasping)
                         i want that thing locked up, starting 
                         now -- now!!! you hear me??!!

               he flees.

                                     liz
                              (to broom)
                         nothing's changed. home, sweet home.

               mortified, broom hurries after manning. hellboy calmly steps 
               through the hole in the wall.

                                     hellboy
                              (seeing her)
                         liz? liz!!

               she spins on her heel and walks off. hellboy turns to myers.

                                     hellboy
                         you!!! you did it, buddy --

               myers holsters his gun and follows liz. hellboy is all alone 
               now.

                                     hellboy
                              (oblivious)
                         woo hoo!!
