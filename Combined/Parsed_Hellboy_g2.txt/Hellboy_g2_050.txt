               ext. courtyard / loading dock machen library - night

               the garbage truck pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.

               fbi/bprd teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed 
               cops and securing the doors.

               three agents -- quarry, stone and moss -- close a gate, 
               sealing off the area.

                                     stone
                         all areas secured.

               from a nearby roof, agent lime signals all clear.

                                     clay
                              (into a handheld radio)
                         seal the doors. red and blue are 
                         coming in.

               the truck stops, clay pulls a lever. myers watches as the 
               dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing 
               hellboy and abe.

                                     clay
                         okay, boys, let's synch up our 
                         locators.

               abe, clay and hellboy activate lights on their belts. they 
               beep and blink. hellboy starts walking.
