               ext. tenement courtyard - steps -  day

               liz: outlined by licking flames!

                                     liz
                              (panicked)
                         mommy! help me! i'm burning!

               mother screams, horrified.

                                     liz
                         help meee!!!

               she then explodes. a white-hot supernova engulfs the 
               courtyard. her mother's body burns like flash paper. then 
               the rest of the people are --

               the entire tenement courtyard

               -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. benches, 
               people, trees. everything. the four surrounding apartment 
               blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.

               the frame whites out. and at ground zero there is but one 
               figure left standing:

               liz... a little girl, still crying.

                                                          flash forward to:
