               int. b.p.r.d. - concrete chamber 51 - dusk

               the elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. neon lights 
               flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. painted on the 
               floor is a huge number: 51.

               right in front of myers: a magnificent oak door.

               myers knocks on it. no answer. myers enters.
