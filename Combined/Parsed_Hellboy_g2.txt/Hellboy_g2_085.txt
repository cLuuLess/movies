               ext. bellamie mental hospital - night

               dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. a small army of emergency 
               vehicles roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

               ...brick 1940's hospital, behind a high wall topped with 
               barbed wire. the mesh-covered windows are decorated with 
               paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. a topiary garden 
               surrounds the building.

               watching from atop the wall is hellboy. one sleeve of his 
               overcoat is soaked in blood. he keeps an eye on the second 
               floor windows. hanging from his tail: the six pack of beer.
