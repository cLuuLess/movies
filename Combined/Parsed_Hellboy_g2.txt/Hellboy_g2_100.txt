               int. bellamie mental hospital - security room - night

               in their glass kiosk, two orderlies are listening to the 
               radio and sharing a pizza. a red light flashes repeatedly on 
               a panel.

               they silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. a low 
               rumble shakes the room.

               through the vibrating glass window they see...

               corridor miniature / composite

               ...a ball of flame pushing inexorably through the corridor. 
               the inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making 
               the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

                                     orderly
                         oh my --
