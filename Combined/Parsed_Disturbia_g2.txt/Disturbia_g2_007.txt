     on ronnie yun, 16, a scrawny korean kid with a knack for
     perfect spanish, stands at the front giving his speech.

     note: every time ronnie says "quizás" ("perhaps") the class
     giggles because it sounds a lot like "kiss-ass."

     the teacher, senor gutierrez, a rotund 50, bad comb-over and
     khakis up to his naval, stands off to the side, quickly
     picking up on ronnie's excessive and increasingly dramatic
     use of the word.

     over this, only one girl, minnie tyco, a rail-thin blonde,
     picks up on this:

                              minnie tyco
                      (under her breath)
                  keep dreaming, perv.

               ronnie                           ronnie (cont'd)
         (longingly)                    perhaps... thank you.
       quizás... gracias.

     the class laughs, claps.    ronnie bows, heads to his seat.

               sr gutierrez                     sr gutierrez (cont'd)
       gracias, ronnie. quizás          thank you, ronnie. perhaps
       le daré una "f."                 i'll give you an "f."

     the class laughs again. gutierrez shakes his head, zeros in
     on the student behind ronnie. sleeping with his arms folded
     on his desk, a grey hoodie pulled over his head.

                              senor gutierrez
                  senor brecht...

     senor gutierrez takes some chalk, flicks it at the kid.       he
     still doesn't budge. ronnie nudges him.

                              ronnie
                  dude --

     the kid stirs, raises his head. the hoodie falls away to
     reveal kale. longer, disheveled hair. the spark in his
     eye's been replaced with an empty haze.

                              senor gutierrez
                  so kale, think you can stay conscious
                  long enough to tell us your plans
                  for the three wondrous summer months
                  ahead?

                                                (continued)    d.j. caruso

                                                                     9.

     kale glances around. all eyes on him. he looks at ronnie
     who nods in support. kale gets up, heads to the front of
     the class. he pauses. trying to focus. then --

                              kale
                  este invierno --

     the class chuckles.

                              senor gutierrez
                      (correcting)
                  verano...

                              kale
                  este verano -- voy a --

                              senor gutierrez
                  ¿qué?

     kale shuts his eyes, frustrated at the interruption. senor
     gutierrez, also losing patience, steps closer to kale.

               sr gutierrez                        sr gutierrez (cont'd)
       ¿qué usted va a hacer?                (subtitled)
                                           what are you going to do?

                              kale
                  i don't know, alright?    i haven't
                  gotten that far.

                              senor gutierrez
                  did you do the homework or not?

                              kale
                      (no eye contact)
                  guess not.

                              senor gutierrez
                      (in kale's face)
                  you "guess" not. i don't know who
                  you think you are or who you think
                  you're dealing with. you can't give
                  me a straight answer, fine, give me
                  one good reason why i shouldn't fail
                  you right now?

     kale clocks gutierrez.
