     he looks at the bracelet. still flashing red. he hops up
     and down as the sprinkler streams approach him from behind.

               no, c'mon, i'm way inside, turn green --

     he spins back toward the house, runs smack into the streams,
     trips on the sprinkler, falls on his face. now his foot's

     ankle bracelet: green light.

                  yes!   that's what i'm talking about!

     he gazes over: ashley's parents, each with a moving box,
     stand there, jaws dropped. both take a nervous step backward
     as ashley steps out the front door. freezes at the sight of
     the sopping wet, shit-and-grass-stained kale. kale locks
     eyes with her. then smiles and waves.

                  it's cool, i'm all green.

     then -- sirens wail. kale turns to the street: two police
     cars screech to a stop. kale loses the smile.

                  kale, calm down, the officers were
                  probably in the neighborhood already.
