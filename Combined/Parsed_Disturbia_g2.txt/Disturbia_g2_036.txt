39   ext. kale's back yard - the next day                               39

     on kale's feet - entering frame, inching their way through
     the yard...

     on the bracelet - the green light suddenly goes out, red
     light flashes. kale's foot quickly steps back. green light.
     a beat, then --

     a smiling garden gnome slams down into frame.

     wider - kale ties kite string around the gnome's hat, then
     unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet
     already hammered into the ground. he pulls the string taut
     and ties it off.

     we pull back to reveal kale's emerging kite string perimeter --
     a crude semi-circular arc around the yard tied off at
     different points using makeshift "stakes" -- gnomes, mallets,
     shovels, screwdrivers...
