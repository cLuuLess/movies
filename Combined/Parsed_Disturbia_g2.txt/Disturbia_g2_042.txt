45   int. kale's bedroom - day                                          45

     kale leads ronnie to the window. ronnie takes in the mess
     in kale's room -- the scuff marks on the walls, the completed
     twinkie tower. he glances to the desk, sees a penciled
     geometric diagram of kale's line-of-sight spying theory --
     shit, kale wasn't lying -- he did do the math.

                              kale
                      (pointing out)
                  so... robert giles...

     kale and ronnie's pov - in the yard across from kale's back
     yard, find robert giles, gassing up his lawnmower in the
     driveway. he's early 40's, clean-cut, fit, decent looking.
     he closes the garage door via remote, then fires up the mower,
     pushes it around the side of his house toward the front yard.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  he's lived there a couple of years,
                  but i've never noticed he mows his
                  lawn every two days.

                              ronnie
                  huh, i guess he likes his grass short.

                  next to him is judy thorp. dude,
                  she freakin' sneaks over to her
                  neighbors' every morning, steals
                  their newspaper, i guess reads it or
                  swipes the coupons, then puts it
                  back before they even wake up.

                               ronnie
                      (sarcastic)
                  no shit?
                      (weirdly eyeing kale
                        who heads out)
                  people. you never can tell these
                  days.
