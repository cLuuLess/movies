62   int. kale's bedroom - night - continuous                           62

     kale enters, tosses the binoculars on the desk, throws a
     glance out the window to giles' house. dark. kale turns to
     the bed, pulls back the sheets. as kale unties his shoes,
     takes off his socks, we notice over his shoulder --

     in the b.g. - a light comes on in giles' living room.

     on kale - not noticing as he strips down to his boxers --

     in the b.g. - giles' living room - the woman heads into the
     room followed closely by giles. she spins and slaps him in
     the face. she walks away as giles stands there frozen.

     on kale - he throws his clothes in the closet, finally turns
     back and sees --

     kale's pov - giles standing in the living room, glaring at
     the woman.

                           kale
               dammit.

     kale darts to his desk, turns off the light, grabs the
     binoculars.

     binocular pov - giles and the woman are arguing. the woman
     paces around the room as giles stands there. the woman's
     arms flail about. as she paces back by giles, he suddenly
     grabs her arms.

                           kale (cont'd)
               shit!

     kale watches as the woman yanks herself from his grasp and
     knocks over the lamp. the bulb shatters on the floor,
     throwing the living room into total darkness.

     kale drops the binoculars and grabs the dv cam. he fumbles
     with it, flips open the lcd screen. but as he presses the
     power button, the camera's lamp suddenly ignites, momentarily
     lighting up kale's room!

     kale spins and hits the floor.   he frantically finds the
     switch, turns off the lamp.

                           kale (cont'd)
               dumbass dumbass --

     kale stays on the floor, slouched under the window sill for
     a couple of beats. then -- he slowly raises up, peers out.

     dv cam pov - giles, now alone, has turned on another light
     and is simultaneously picking up pieces of shattered light

     bulb and wiping some red liquid off the floor...    could be
     wine... or blood even...

     giles wads the towel up, picks up one of the woman's high
     heels lying near the couch. giles then moves to the stereo,
     turns it off, leans down, picks up the woman's other shoe.
     he flips off the lights, heads out of the room.

     kale trades the grainy dv cam for the binoculars.

     binocular pov - kale pans across the lower floor windows of
     giles' house that's now become eerily still. he tilts up to
     the second floor, slowly pans across those windows -- again,
     nothing.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  okay, so where is she --

     binocular pov - over the above, kale slowly pans back across
     the same windows, comes to the last one and see giles staring
     right back at him.

     kale spins and dives to the floor, knocking the other camera
     and tri-pod over.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  oh shit oh shit...

     kale shoves himself against the wall, frozen in terror. he
     doesn't dare get up. he spots his cell phone -- on the floor
     a few feet away. he extends his leg out, uses his foot to
     slowly sliiide the phone toward him.

     kale's trembling hand reaches for the phone, picks it up --

     kale's about to flip it open when the phone's lcd screen
     suddenly lights up, blaring madonna's "like a virgin."

     kale startles, fumbles the phone -- realizes it's ronnie,
     flips the phone open --

                              kale (cont'd)
                      (into phone as needed)
                  ronnie --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                      (phone filter as needed)
                  dude, ashley is ho-ho-hotttt --

                              kale
                  giles totally busted me.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  what do you mean, are you sure?

     kale finally musters the courage to peek over the sill --

     kale's pov - gile's back door is open.

                              kale
                  they were arguing --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  who?

                              kale
                  giles and the girl he brought home.
                  they had an argument, he grabbed her --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  and then what?

                              kale
                  and then -- nothing.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  uh-huh.

                              kale
                  dude, something is going on over
                  there. what if he killed her, too?

                               ronnie (v.o.)
                  then call your friends at the police
                  department.

     a door suddenly slams o.s.

                              kale
                  wait --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  what?

                              kale
                  a door just slammed.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                      (in his best sinister
                       "scream" voice)
                  that's right, kale, and now i'm coming
                  up to slash your guts out, you little
                  bastard!

                              kale
                  asshole, i'm serious.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  i'm not and i'm hanging up.

                              kale
                  just -- wait -- wait till i check
                  the hall --

     this as kale grabs his bat, slowly approaches his door.
     ronnie yawns, starts snoring. kale's hand is about to grab
     the knob --

                                  ronnie (v.o.)
                  boo!

                              kale
                  goddamn you!!

     kale flips the phone closed, throws it to the bed. he turns
     back to the door just as it suddenly pushes open, smacking
     kale in the forehead! kale stumbles back, screams, raises
     the bat.

                              julie
                  kale, kale, it's me!!

     kale doesn't immediately drop the bat as he focuses on julie,
     dressed in her serving uniform, barely visible in the
     darkness. she flips the light on.

                                  kale
                  no, don't!

                              julie
                  what's going on, who were you talking
                  to?!

                              kale
                  ronnie -- just ronnie.

     kale falls back to the bed.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  i heard the door --

                              julie
                  i'm sorry, the wind caught it --

                                  kale
                  fine.   good.     okay --

                              julie
                  okay then, so...
                      (catching her breath;
                       then)
                  you want anything from the grocery?
                  i'm going in the morning.

                              kale
                  anything caffeinated.

     kale turns back on his side. julie eyes him a long beat.
     what to say... she flips off the light, then -- pulls the
     door closed.

     on kale - eyes wide open, heart racing.    he's gonna need
     that caffeine in the morning.
