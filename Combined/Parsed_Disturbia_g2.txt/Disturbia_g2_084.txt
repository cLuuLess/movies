87   ext. giles' front yard - night - continuous                        87

     it's even darker on this side. no lights on in giles' house.
     kale cautiously rounds the side, approaches the front door --
     it's open a few inches -- darkness beyond.

     kale eyes it a beat. then -- steps up onto the porch, about
     to push it open when -- sirens blare o.s.

     kale spins around to see a police cruiser rolling to a stop.
     kale races toward it as two uniformed officers step out --

                             kale
               hey!

     the officer pulls his sidearm, aims it at kale --

                             uniform #1
               freeze.    hands above your head, now!!

                           kale
               please, my friend's been kidnapped,
               he's in this house -- he's inside, i
               think the owner's trying to kill him --

                           uniform #1
               stay right there.

                           uniform #2
               i've got it --

     uniform #2 heads briskly to giles' front door.

                              uniform #1
                      (into radio mic)
                  dispatch, 13a74, we're 10-26 with
                  the kid, he's claiming a 10-31 at...
                      (eying numbers above
                       giles' door)
                  4710 fairway court. house behind
                  his residence, request 10-78.

                              dispatcher (v.o.)
                      (over mic)
                  13a74, ten-four, units already in
                  the area, will advise --

     kale watches as uniform #2 approaches the giles' door.

                               uniform #2
                  it's open.

                              kale
                  it was already open.

     uniform #2 knocks on the door. rings the bell. no answer.
     uniform #2's about to knock again when a light comes on
     inside. after a beat -- giles opens the door. looking
     disheveled, in his bathrobe.

                              giles
                  uh, yes, can i help you, officer?

                              uniform #2
                  sorry to wake you, sir, we have a
                  young man here claiming a friend of
                  his is in your house. would you
                  know anything about that?

                               giles
                      (laughs)
                  no, i certainly wouldn't.

                              kale
                  you're a lying son of a bitch!

     uniform #1 retrains kale as another cruiser rolls to a stop.
     uniforms #3 & 4 hop out, head to uniform #1 to assist.

                              uniform #1
                  take it easy --

                              kale
                  he's in there, goddammit!   he's
                  inside! he's lying!

     uniform #1 pulls kale back to the cruiser, opens the back
     door and pushes him down on the seat --

                                                   (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                     88.

87   continued:    (2)                                                     87

                              uniform #1
                  sir, calm down --

                              kale
                  okay, but he's lying -- he has my
                  friend, and he kidnapped that girl
                  last week, he killed maybe three
                  others, all redheads, they could be
                  in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag --
                  in his garage -- my friend knew this --
                      (re: giles)
                  that's why he's covering -- he didn't
                  just wake up five minutes ago --

     uniform #1 looks concerned as he steps away from kale.

                              uniform #1
                      (to uniform #3; re:
                       kale)
                  can you --

     uniform #3 nods as uniform #1 heads back up to giles and
     uniform #2.

     kale's pov - uniform #1 whispers something to uniform #2.
     they turn back to giles.

                              uniform #2
                  sir, do you mind if we take a look
                  inside?

     a beat. a couple more police cruisers roll to a stop.
     curious neighbors are now gathering across the street.

                              giles
                  absolutely, be my guest.

     giles ushers them through the door and follows them into the
     house. giles turns, shoots a quick glance to kale before
     closing the door.

     on kale - all he can do is wait. he shifts his gaze to the
     gathering neighbors. a few lock eyes with him, shake their
     heads. kale turns back toward the house...

                                                            time cut to:
