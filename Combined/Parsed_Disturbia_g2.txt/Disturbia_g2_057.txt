60   int. dad's office - night - later                                  60

     on ashley's window - shades still drawn. lights are out
     now. the wind picks up outside as we pan to reveal kale
     asleep in the leather chair.

     we suddenly hear glass shatter o.s.

     kale's eyes pop open. he looks around. did he hear something
     or did he dream it -- he pulls himself out of the chair,
     makes his way to the door, slowly swings it open...
