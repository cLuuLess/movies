40   ext. kale's front yard - day - short time later                    40

     same "boundary construction" here. kale shoves a screwdriver
     into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox. he ties some
     string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the
     pilch's) yard, sees their black labra-doodle watching him.

                              kale
                  hey doggie, come here...

     the dog trots toward kale. it almost reaches his outstretched
     hand when it suddenly gets zapped by the underground electric
     fence. it yelps away. spins back around, sits and stares.

                              kale (cont'd)
                      (re: his ankle bracelet)
                  hey, you and me both.

     over kale's shoulder in the b.g. - ashley

     lifts more boxes from the back of their station wagon. she
     sets them on the drive, slams the liftgate. kale turns
     around. ashley throws him a quick glance, then heads around
     the back of her house. kale stares after her.
