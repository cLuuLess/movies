     where she holds the i-pod out the window, stopping kale in
     his tracks.

                              ashley
                  back off or i'll throw it where you
                  can't follow.

                              kale
                  take it easy, that's sixty gigs of
                  my life.

                                 ashley
                  even better.

                              kale
                  okay -- okay --

                              ashley
                  what are you doing?

                              kale
                  what are you doing?

                              ashley
                  i'm trying to enjoy my party. wait,
                  that's wrong. according to you,
                  i'm trying to conform --

                              kale
                  coulda fooled me.

                              ashley
                  what does that mean?

                                 kale
                  forget --

                              ashley
                  no, i'm not gonna forget it.

                              kale
                  you wanna blend in with that crowd,
                  fine, then stop looking up and trying
                  to get a rise outta me.

                              ashley
                      (realizing)
                  so you were watching me. question
                  is for how long? just tonight?    or
                  maybe a week? two weeks? since i
                  moved in?

     kale tries to respond, but ashley keeps pressing:

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  and the whole "my-neighbor's-the-
                  killer" thing. great cover --


                                                 (continued)   d.j. caruso

                              kale
                  it's not a cover --

     over the above ashley glances around

                              ashley
                  so what is it, kale?   huh?   what
                  else have you seen?

                              kale
                  what else have i seen?

                               ashley
                  yeah.   what else?

                              kale
                  okay -- i've seen how you always
                  pull your kleenex from the box in
                  groups of three. not two, not four,
                  always three. i've seen you're the
                  only one in the world who eats pizza-
                  flavored pringles. and you never
                  stuff the chips in, you savor each
                  one by dividing it into four precise
                  bites. i didn't know that was even
                  possible. you're also the first
                  girl i've ever seen who spends more
                  time on her roof than in her own
                  house. and what do you do out there?
                  you don't talk on the phone, you
                  don't paint your nails, you read
                  books. now one would think with the
                  whole numbers thing you've got going
                  on that you'd put them on your shelf
                  alphabetically, but you don't. your
                  system's much more perfect. the
                  ones you like go on the bottom, the
                  ones you love go in the middle, and
                  the ones you need, the ones you keep
                  going back to... well they go straight
                  to the top next to the dream
                  encyclopedia. you know what all
                  this tells me? you know how things
                  should be. the world according to
                  ashley. and guess what? it's a
                  very entertaining and beautiful
                  thing. even when it takes a hit.
                  when you end up in a place like
                  this... when your parents dump their
                  baggage on you, or just... when it
                  seems like those curveballs are never
                  gonna stop -- it sucks, but just so
                  you know -- i get it.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  but i've also seen those designer
                  window shades of yours, and guess
                  what? they always go up the next
                  day -- no matter what. and even if
                  no one else has, i've noticed that.
                  and i ain't sorry. the only thing
                  i'll even consider apologizing for
                  is... not dropping the binoculars
                  and telling you this a lot sooner.

     a long beat as ashley peers into kale's eyes.      she slowly
     steps closer to him:

                              ashley
                  that was either the creepiest... or
                  the sweetest thing i've ever heard.

     kale leans in and kisses her. they pull away, lock eyes.
     then -- ashley pulls kale by his soaking wet t-shirt, kisses
     him back even harder. heavy make-out. then -- they stumble
     back toward the bed out of frame as we hold on kale's window --
     and giles' house beyond...
