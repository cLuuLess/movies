13   int. kale's house - kitchen - day                                     13

     a pair of hands wrap an electronic monitoring      bracelet around
     kale's left ankle. wider to reveal the hands       belong to kale's
     case officer, janet parker, 35, no-nonsense.       kale's perched
     on the center island. julie watches from the       b.g.

     as parker clicks the bracelet's buckle into place, a green
     led light illuminates. it's on the top edge of the bracelet's
     band so kale can easily see it if he looks down. next to
     this light is an additional red light that isn't on.

                              parker
                      (making final checks)
                  okay, you... are all set... to go
                  nowhere.
                      (re: the led lights)
                  now, green means you're good, you're
                  in the safe zone which covers about
                              (more)

                              parker (cont'd)
                  a sixty-foot radius from this guy
                  here.

     parker points to a big black box (the central tracking unit)
     on the kitchen counter.

                              parker (cont'd)
                  he's like a modem. he gets a constant
                  signal from mr. bracelet that he
                  sends through your phone line to the
                  monitoring station downtown. so
                  they know where you are, where you've
                  been and what you're thinkin' 25/7.

                              julie
                  what if he accidentally goes beyond --

                              parker
                      (anticipating; re:
                       red light on bracelet)
                  red light flashes. means you've got
                  about ten seconds to get your butt
                  back to green, or else --

                              kale
                  the execution squad shows up?

                              parker
                  and they don't bring blindfolds.
                  it's also tamper proof and waterproof.
                  so don't try sticking your foot in a
                  bucket of water and hopping across
                  the line. it won't work, and you'll
                  look stupid. now, i'll be checking
                  up on you a lot. here's my card --
                  you're set up to pay his incarceration
                  fee, ms. brecht?

                              julie
                  automatic withdrawal.
                      (to kale)
                  twelve bucks every day.

                              parker
                      (re: a booklet)
                  everything else is in the manual.
                      (making her way out)
                  oh, except this -- house arrest might
                  sound like a breeze, but trust me,
                  i've seen all kinds of folks get a
                  bit loopy before too long, some after
                  just a day or two. so make sure you
                  find lots of constructive things to
                  keep yourself busy.
