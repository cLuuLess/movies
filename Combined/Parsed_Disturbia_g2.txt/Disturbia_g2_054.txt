57   int. kale's bedroom - night - later                                  57

     tracking across kale's room - the two tri-pod-mounted dv
     cams stand watch over giles' house. one camera feeds a grainy
     close-up shot of giles' garage door to ronnie's portable tv
     on the floor. the other feeds a wide shot of giles' entire
     house to kale's color tv. both images appear on kale's
     computer monitor.

     wider to reveal - kale and ashley sit on the floor near the
     window. kale peers over to giles with the binoculars as
     ashley messes with kale's cell phone. in the b.g. ronnie's
     passed out on kale's bed, his hand resting inside the pizza
     box just inches from the last slice.

                              kale
                      (re: giles)
                  he's been gone awhile.

     on ashley - she's messing with kale's cell phone.

                              ashley
                      (handing him his cell)
                  here.

                              kale
                  how'd you get my phone?

                              ashley
                  i'm crafty like that.

                              kale
                  what'd you do?

     ashley carefully unclips ronnie's cell from his hip, flips
     it open, dials. after a beat, kale's cell rings with
     madonna's "like a virgin." kale laughs.

                               ashley
                  every time he calls, that's what
                  you'll hear.

     kale laughs as ashley delicately re-clips the phone to
     ronnie's belt.

     kale's pov - the pilch's dog, wearing a pink sweater, suddenly
     darts into kale's yard.

                                                                       43.

57   continued:                                                              57

                              kale
                  what the hell?

     their pov - pilch's dog stops, spins around and takes a dump.

                               kale (cont'd)
                  where's --

     mr. pilch, in his robe, suddenly appears from the shadows,
     watches the dog do its business.

                              ashley
                      (re: mr. pilch)
                  three to one he doesn't pick it up.

     nope. the dog finishes.      pilch calls it over, scoops up the
     dog and heads o.s.

                              kale
                  so that's why the grass is greener...

                              ashley
                  only in disturbia...

                              kale
                  so why the move?

                              ashley
                  what do you mean? the greener grass,
                  the safer pastures...

                              kale
                  no, seriously.

     there's a beat as ashley locks eyes with kale.       then --

                              ashley
                  well, i guess my mom thought it'd
                  help keep dad on a shorter leash.
                  city life... had its temptations...
                      (beat; then matter of
                       fact)
                  but my mom pretty much cries just as
                  much as she always did, and dad
                  doesn't care -- more than ever.

                              kale
                  what did they think, an extra bathroom
                  and two-car garage would actually
                  change things... somehow protect
                  them and you from all that crap you
                  can never escape?

     ashley holds kale's gaze for a beat.      then, she nods, with:


                                                  (continued)       d.j. caruso

57   continued:    (2)                                                    57

                              ashley
                  something like that.
                      (eyeing the bracelet)
                  so... what're your issues, kale?

     kale hesitates. we see in his eyes that he's flashing to
     the past... "going there..." there's an uneasy beat as ashley
     picks up on it:

     then -- headlights appear outside. kale quickly turns away
     from ashley, pulls one of the dv cams off its tri-pod, flips
     out the three-inch lcd screen.

                                kale
                  that's him.

     dv cam pov - giles' silver toyota pulls in the driveway.
     stops. engine and headlights turn off.

                              ashley
                  another car --

     dv cam pov - kale zooms in. the grainy image finally steadies
     to reveal a second car pulling in behind giles. a thirty-
     something attractive woman -- a redhead -- is at the wheel.
     she pulls in next to giles' car.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  you seen her before?

                                kale
                  no.

     dv cam pov - giles gets out.      wearing a suit, no tie.

                              ashley
                      (re: giles)
                  cute for a killer.

     giles goes to the woman's car, opens her door.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  who said chivalry's dead?

     the woman gets out, wearing a black cocktail dress.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  there's a club girl for you.

                              kale
                  how do you know?

                              ashley
                  bright green bracelet's "the
                  pyramids," purple's "club 360," the
                  big black stamp's from "flavor."

     dv cam pov - kale zooms in on the woman's wrist and hand.
     sure enough, she's wearing both a green and a purple bracelet,
     and has a black stamp blotch on her hand.

                              kale
                      (over the above)
                  missing girl was seen at a club.
                  didn't say which one though...
                      (then aside to ashley)
                  your i.d. must be pretty good.

                              ashley
                      (with a smile)
                  i don't need one.

     they turn back to the window, watch as giles escorts the
     woman to the house, shows her in. a light comes on inside.

     dv cam pov - kale zooms in on one of the living room windows,
     spots the woman moving around inside, looking at artwork...
     she sits on the sofa as giles enters with two glasses and a
     bottle of wine. he sits down, pours the wine. they toast,
     take sips. giles moves in for a kiss --

                              kale
                  he's going in.

     dv cam pov - the woman shies away from giles, stands from
     the sofa.

                              ashley
                  denied...

     they watch as the woman gets up, moves to the center of the
     room, and starts to get a little groove on...

                              ashley (cont'd)
                      (been there, done
                       that)
                  oh no, he put on music...

     dv cam pov - giles watches the woman as she seductively moves
     her body to the music we're not hearing.

                               ashley (cont'd)
                  oh, c'mon, giles, all she wants to
                  do is dance.

                  what do you think they're listening
                  to?

                               ashley
                  could be radio. see if you can find
                  the station.

     kale sets the camera down, turns on his receiver. as he
     toggles through radio stations -- rock, alternative...

                       giles)
                  no... no...

     kale flips to an easy listening r & b station playing lou
     rawls "you'll never find another love like mine."

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  stop.

     binocular pov - ashley watches as giles takes the woman's
     hand and dances with her. their rhythm fits the music
     perfectly.

     on ronnie - he stirs on the bed, still asleep.

                              ronnie
                      (eyes closed; grinning
                       re: music)
                  hmmm...

     ashley and kale eye ronnie for a beat.     then turn back to
     the window.

     dv cam pov - kale pans back to the woman and giles. they're
     really dancing close now. kale's and ashley's eyes shift to
     each other, then quickly flick away. a beat. then -- ashley
     raises the binoculars, faces back toward giles' with:

                              ashley
                  now's the time to bust your move.

     ashley glances to kale. kale turns, holds her gaze. a
     palpable tension between these two. they ever so slowly
     lean toward each other when --

     ronnie - suddenly interrupts, pushing himself between them.

                              ronnie
                      (yawning; re: woman
                       with giles)
                  who's that?

     ronnie looks to kale and ashley who glare back.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                      (realizing)
                  ookay, just fill me in later.
                      (taking ashley's hand)
                  a pleasure.
                      (then; aside to kale,
                       mouths; re: ashley)
                  duude!
                      (slaps kale's hand)
                  later.

     ronnie stands, leaves. kale shakes his head, turns back to
     ashley. they lean in again when -- ashley's cell phone
     ominously rings with the first measures of beethoven's 5th --
     "bum bum bum bummmmm." she pulls the cell from her pocket.

                               ashley
                      (re: cell)
                  it's my mom.
                      (into cell)
                  hi. no, i'm fine.
                      (with a smile)
                  i'm at barnes and noble.    okay, i'm
                  leaving. no, i'll walk.

     ashley flips the phone shut, joins kale who's watching the
     lcd screen:

     dv cam pov - giles and the woman are back on the couch. the
     woman is leaning her head on giles' shoulder. as giles leans
     forward to take her wine glass, the woman falls over behind
     him. out cold. kale and ashley cringe.

                              kale
                  and she's down for the count.
