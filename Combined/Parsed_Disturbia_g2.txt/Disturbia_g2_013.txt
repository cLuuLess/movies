17   int. kale's bedroom - night - later                                    17

     kale, looking disheveled and very perplexed, now has his tv
     pulled out from the wall. he's behind it, meticulously
     checking and re-connecting all the wires and ethernet cable.
     carefully studying the manual as he goes.

     he blows on the halo 2 cd, wipes it down with his sweatshirt,
     gently puts it in the tray, giving us the idea this might
     not be his first attempt at this.

     he powers up the xbox, grabs a controller... so far, so
     good... he scrolls through the screens, a little hope
     returning... server error.

     kale throws a mini-fit, slams the controller to the floor.
     rips the controller cord out of the xbox --
