84   int. kale's bedroom - night - short time later                         84

     a shaky and grainy video image appears on kale's computer
     screen. kale picks up one of ronnie's old walkie-talkies.

                              kale
                      (into walkie talkie
                       as needed)
                  you read?

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                      (walkie talkie filter
                       as needed)
                  yeah, you got a signal?

     on kale's computer screen - ronnie suddenly aims the video
     camera at his face.

                              kale
                  got video, no audio.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  yeah, mic's on the fritz.    how am i
                  looking?

     kale picks up the binoculars.

     binocular pov - giles' garage door is still open.     there's a
     light on at the opposite end of the house.

                              kale
                  light on, far end.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  i guess it's now or never.    moving
                  out.

                                                                    83.

     kale turns back to the computer screen --

     ronnie's dv cam pov - his feet dart across the yard -- he
     tilts up -- approaching the fence.

                               kale
                      (re: giles)
                  no movement.

     ronnie's dv cam pov - ronnie hops the fence.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  first hurdle --

     ronnie's dv cam pov - the image goes to snow for a split
     second -- the signal weakening...

     kale peers out the window --

     binocular pov - we barely make out ronnie's silhouette as he
     makes his way toward the garage --

                                 ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  twenty feet.     ten feet --

     ronnie's dv cam pov - rapidly approaching the back of giles'
     toyota.

                                 ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  garage --

     ronnie's   dv cam pov - very shaky as ronnie makes his way to
     the back   seat door -- he takes out a pen light, aims it at
     the door   as his hand enters frame, lifts up on the latch.
     the door   pops open.

                                 ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  bingo.

     ronnie's dv cam pov - we see ronnie's hand feeling around
     the back seat floor of giles' car.

     kale's call waiting suddenly beeps. he looks at the caller
     i.d: ashley. shit. he has to let it go.

                              ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  i'm not seeing it --

                              kale
                  stay calm, it's there.

     ronnie's dv cam pov - ronnie's hand finally pulls out the
     cell phone.



                                                   (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                      84.

84   continued:    (2)                                                      84

                                 ronnie (v.o.)
                  i've got it.

     binocular pov - giles' house.       still no sign of movement.

                              kale
                  you're still clear, check the bag.

                                 ronnie (v.o.)
                  hang on --

     ronnie's dv cam pov - we see ronnie's hand gently push the
     door of giles' toyota closed. the angle tilts down -- we're
     now watching ronnie's feet as they stride deeper into the
     garage, walking in between the toyota and mustang.

                              ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  i'm setting the camera on the trunk.

                              kale
                  try to get the plate number of the
                  mustang and check for dents --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  i'm checking the bag first.

     ronnie's dv cam pov - ronnie sets the camera on the trunk of
     the mustang, aims it perfectly at the blue bag sitting in
     the corner. we watch with kale as ronnie enters frame,
     crouched low, heading toward the bag. he raises the walkie
     talkie --

                              ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  it does look like blood -- and hair --

     ronnie's dv cam pov - we watch as ronnie kneels down, starts
     to open the bag. but suddenly, the still pov suddenly starts
     to slowly, steadily track to the left -- and kale realizes --

                              kale
                  the camera's sliding --

     ronnie's dv cam pov - we watch as ronnie spins and grabs the
     camera.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  that was close.

     we hear another noise o.s.

                                 ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  oh shit --

     kale looks out --


                                                   (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                       85.

84   continued:    (3)                                                       84

     kale's pov - giles' garage door starts to close.

                                kale
                  ronnie?

                              ronnie
                      (staticky)
                  -- make it -- interference --
                  somebody's here --

                                kale
                  ronnie?!

     dead air.    giles' garage door slams shut.

     ronnie's dv cam pov - we watch as ronnie picks up the camera,
     aims it at his face. looking terrified. the camera swings
     away as we see ronnie's feet scrambling along the concrete
     floor and then -- they appear to race through a doorway onto
     dimly lit hardwood floor -- making us and kale realize --

                              kale (cont'd)
                  he's in the house --
                      (into walkie)
                  ronnie?

     still nothing.

     ronnie's dv cam pov - shaky. we catch glimpses of ronnie's
     feet -- hauling ass down a hallway, rounding a corner onto
     carpet, then back onto hardwood --

                              kale (cont'd)
                  what the hell --

     on the screen - ronnie suddenly pans the camera up to his
     face as he runs, clearly mouthing "help me!!"

                                kale (cont'd)
                  ronnie!    shit --

     then -- the camera seems to fall, sliding on the hardwood
     floor toward an old bookcase...

     the image cuts out -- goes to all snow --

     kale jumps up, pacing. peers out the window to giles'. no
     telling what the hell's happening -- or happened -- in there.

     kale eyes his ankle bracelet.      green light.   kale eyes his
     bat. grabs it. fuck it.




                                                                 d.j. caruso

                                                                  86.
