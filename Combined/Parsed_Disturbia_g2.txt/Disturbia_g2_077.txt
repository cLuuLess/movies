80   int. kale's bedroom - day - later                                  80

     cu - kale's cell phone - "like a virgin" suddenly blares.

     wider - kale flips his cell open, holds it in one hand, binocs
     in the other.

                               kale
                      (into headset as needed)
                  yo, you set?

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                      (phone filter as
                       needed; suddenly
                       sounding not so macho)
                  i can't believe i'm doing this.

                              kale
                  let me conference ashley in.
                      (punches buttons;
                       then)
                  ashley, you there?

                                ashley (v.o.)
                  ten-four.

                                kale
                  nice.

80   continued:                                                              80

     kale presses "record" on the tri-pod-mounted dv cam. he
     peers back out the window. we hear giles' lawnmower o.s.
     both sides of his house are clear.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  okay, ron -- green light.

     kale's pov - out his window - ronnie - suddenly appears from
     the bottom of frame, keeping low as he darts to the fence.
     ronnie turns, peers back up to kale, gives him the thumbs up
     or down.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  you're all good.

     binocular pov - ronnie draws a breath, then very ungracefully
     hops the fence and falls into giles' yard out of sight.

                                 ronnie (v.o.)
                  oww, shit --

                                 kale
                  you okay --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  what do you think?

     binocular pov - ronnie scrambles to his feet from behind the
     fence, darts to the driver's side door of giles' toyota.

                              kale
                  dude, glove compartment, other side.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  excuse me if i'm used to my mom's
                  import. can i just try this one
                  while i'm here?

     binocular pov - ronnie lifts up on the latch.        locked.

                                 ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  shit.

     ronnie tries the back door.        locked.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                      (in korean)
                  shit.

     binocular pov - kale pans across to the other side of giles'
     house. nothing. he pans back to ronnie.

     our pov - over kale's shoulder, we see kale is clearly aiming
     his binocs at ronnie.


                                                   (continued)      d.j. caruso

80   continued:    (2)                                                  80

     but we also see on the far side of frame giles' neighbor
     pulls her lawnmower out of her garage and rolls it o.s --
     but kale isn't seeing this!

                              ronnie (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  they're all gonna be locked --

                              kale
                  well, while you're there, will you
                  just check?

     ronnie goes around the back of the toyota to the other side.
     he lifts up on the passenger door latch. bingo.

                                 ronnie (v.o.)
                  i'm in.

                              kale
                  you see the package?

     we see and hear ronnie, his ass to us, rummaging around the
     inside of giles' car.

                                 ronnie (v.o.)
                  oh my god --

                              ashley (v.o.)
                  what's wrong?

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  there's like a month-old order of
                  nachos bell grande under the seat.
                      (then)
                  okay, i found it.

     kale grabs the pencil and notebook.

                              kale
                  whenever you're ready.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  looks like "on, on, on, off, off,
                  on..." no wait, that one was "off."

                              kale
                  just start over.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  "on, on, on, off, off, off, on -- "

     ronnie pauses. kale glances up. just happens to shift his
     gaze to the side of giles' house to see --

     kale's pov - giles is walking back around with no lawnmower!
     but for some reason we still hear a lawnmower.

                                                 (continued)   d.j. caruso

                               kale
                  no, no --

     kale grabs the binoculars.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  i'll get it right this time.

                              kale
                  ronnie, he's coming around.

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  dude, stop dicking with me, i still
                  hear his --

     binocular pov - kale whip pans to giles' neighbor, judy thorp -
     cutting her grass, too.

                              kale
                      (trying to remain
                       calm and succinct)
                  ronnie, i am not dicking with you.
                  the neighbor is also mowing her lawn
                  and he's going to see you --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                      (full-on panic)
                  kale, what do i do?! where --

                              kale
                  get in the car!!

     kale's pov - ronnie dives in the car just as giles rounds
     the corner of the house.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  put the remote back --

                              ronnie (v.o.)
                  i did, i did --

                              kale
                  easy on the door.

     ronnie gently pulls the door shut.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  don't panic, he's coming straight
                  for you --

                               ronnie (v.o.)
                  what?!   kale, you've gotta get me --

                              kale
                  back seat, now!

     binocular pov - ronnie tumbles into the back seat and out of
     sight just as giles heads for the car.

                               kale (v.o.) (cont'd)
                  ashley --

                               ashley (v.o.)
                  i'm on it.

                              ronnie
                      (practically crying)
                  kale, tell my mom --

                              kale
                  shut up, stay down and don't move.

     kale's pov - giles opens the passenger door. about to reach
     in when something distracts him -- giles pulls himself out,
     looks over to see

     ashley

     heading up the driveway. we barely hear her introduce herself
     to giles. giles steps around to the front of the car,
     uneasily shakes her hand.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  ronnie, you're good --

     no answer.

                               kale (cont'd)
                  ronnie?

     binocular pov - kale tilts back to the toyota, sees ronnie
     sneaking out the back seat door on the driver's side as ashley
     distracts giles, pointing up to the trees on the opposite
     side of the yard. who knows what they're talking about.
     bird-watching perhaps. whatever it is, it's working.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  ronnie, was that the whole code?
                  ronnie?

     binocular pov - kale pans back to ronnie as he hops the fence
     back into kale's yard.

     kale tilts back up to ashley and giles in the driveway.

                              kale (cont'd)
                      (talking to ashley
                       even though she can't
                       hear)
                  okay, ashley, you're good, come on...


                                                 (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                   77.

     over this, a breathless ronnie stumbles into the bedroom,
     joins kale at the window.

                              kale (cont'd)
                  was that the whole code?

                                 ronnie
                      (pissed)
                  excuse me?

                              kale
                      (serious)
                  the code, did you get it?

                              ronnie
                  you've gotta be kidding.

     ronnie and kale lock eyes for a tense beat.     then:

                              kale
                      (re: something o.s.)
                  no way.

     kale's pov - the club girl giles brought home the other night
     exits the back door and walks up to ashley and giles!

                              ronnie
                      (stepping closer)
                  great, kale. she lives.

     kale and ronnie watch as ashley shakes hands with the club
     girl, then throws a quick surprised glance up to kale and
     ronnie. giles' body language tells us he's ready for ashley
     to leave. ashley gets the hint, shakes his hand, heads back
     down the driveway and out of sight.

     kale raises the binoculars again, then furiously grabs for
     his pad and pencil.

     binocular pov - the club girl gets in her car. giles closes
     her door, watches as she backs out. kale tilts down to her
     license plate, starts jotting down the number.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  what are you doing?

                              kale
                  getting her license number --

                                 ronnie
                  why?

     kale doesn't answer, still trying to get the rest of the
     number as ashley enters, eyes ronnie who gestures to kale.


                                                  (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                 78.

                              ashley
                  okay, case closed.

                              ronnie
                  try telling inspector clouseau that.
                  now he thinks he needs her license
                  number.

                               ashley
                  why, kale?   it's over.

     kale's starting to get manic:

                              kale
                  "yeah, he seemed like such a normal
                  guy. sure he kept to himself, but
                  he was always nice to me." that's
                  what they all say. that's what all
                  the neighbors always say -- after
                  the fact. only after they've caught
                  the guy, after he's killed thirty
                  people --

     ashley and ronnie trade concerned looks.

                              ashley
                  okay, i think we all just need to
                  take a breath.

                              kale
                      (heading out)
                  fine, but what about the bumper
                  sticker, there's still a girl missing,
                  just... what's in the bag?
                      (then from o.s.)
                  can anyone tell me that?

     off ronnie and ashley --
