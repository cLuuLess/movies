16   int. kale's house - kitchen - night - continuous                   16

     kale runs into julie who wears a black blouse and slacks,
     the required uniform of the steakhouse she works at. she's
     just thrown a couple of microwave dinners on the kitchen
     table. she's scrambling around, eating a couple bites,
     gathering her things...

                           julie
               dinner's on the table. i'm closing
               at the restaurant the next few nights.
               could be some late ones, but hey...
               the extra tips couldn't hurt.

     kale sits at the table, picks through his food.

                           julie (cont'd)
                   (glancing around)
               where's my apron... apron...

     she heads o.s. for a beat, comes back in with her apron and
     purse, sets them on the counter. eyes her watch, sits at
     the table, takes a couple more quick bites. then --

                              julie (cont'd)
                  you wanna talk about anything?

                              kale
                  i got nothin'.

                              julie
                  y'know, when we're finally free of
                  all this legal stuff with the
                  accident, the other families'
                  lawyers... there might be a little
                  insurance money left... maybe you
                  should go back and see dr. phillips?

                              kale
                  what, so he can tell me i'm add,
                  have ptsd, and severe iad?

                              julie
                  iad?

                              kale
                      (messing with bracelet)
                  freakin' irritated ankle disorder.

     julie can't help but crack a little smile:

                              julie
                  well, that one could've been avoided.

     kale looks back up. he's not smiling. whatever chance we
     had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly
     fizzles. another beat, then -- julie pushes her chair back,
     heads to the counter, grabs her apron and purse.

                              julie (cont'd)
                      (heading out)
                  do the dishes.
                      (pleading)
                  please?

     julie leaves. kale glances around the kitchen.       a mess of
     dirty dishes, stacks of paper... screw that.
