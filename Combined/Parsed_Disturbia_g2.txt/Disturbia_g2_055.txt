58   ext. kale's back yard - night - moments later                        58

     kale and ashley cross the yard to kale's kite string boundary.

                              ashley
                  looks like this is as far as you go.

                                kale
                  looks like.

     they peer into each other's eyes.       then --

                              ashley
                  y'know, i have to admit, you're
                  different than i expected.

                                                                    48.

58   continued:                                                           58

                              kale
                  what were you expecting?

                              ashley
                  i thought you'd be more messed up.

                              kale
                  does that disappoint you? 'cause i
                  can be more messed up if you want me
                  to.

                              ashley
                  no, you're fine.

                              kale
                  "fine?"

                              ashley
                  yeah.

                              kale
                  "fine" like your first cousin "fine"
                  or "fine" in kind of a brad pitt
                  sorta way?

     ashley smiles. they suddenly hear voices o.s.       kale and
     ashley glance over to giles' house.

     their pov - the woman is heading briskly to her car.     giles
     is right behind her.

     ashley grabs kale's arm and pulls him behind a shrub on his
     side of the boundary.

     they peek back over to giles'.

     their pov - we're crouched low now, so we only hear the barely
     audible voices of giles and the woman. talking seriously
     about something --

                              giles
                      (voice raising)
                  just come back in the house, you
                  shouldn't drive --

                              ashley
                  he wants her to come back in --

                              kale
                  i can't hear --

                              ashley
                  let's get closer --



                                                (continued)     d.j. caruso

                                                                    49.

58   continued:    (2)                                                    58

     ashley suddenly darts from behind the shrub and bolts toward
     the fence --

                              kale
                      (re: his bracelet)
                  i can't --

     but ashley keeps going.

     we follow behind ashley - she creeps over to the fence,
     presses up against it, peering through the cracks --

     ashley's pov - we see the dark silhouettes of giles and the
     woman -- ashley shifts her head, straining to listen --

                              giles
                  you really should stay.

                              woman
                  i just don't think it's a good idea --
                      (still searching;
                       more frustrated)
                  where the hell are they?

     the woman suddenly drops her purse.       the contents spill onto
     the driveway.

     ashley's pov - giles bends down, picks up her car keys.

                              woman (cont'd)
                  here --

                              giles
                  you're in no condition --

                              woman
                  give me my keys.

                              giles
                  sorry.

     ashley's pov - she sees giles make a motion toward the fence.
     suddenly, the woman's car keys whack the other side of the
     fence, then plop down underneath it just a couple of feet
     from ashley's position!

     on ashley - she startles, looks over, sees the keys.

     ashley's pov - she looks back toward giles and the woman.
     hears the woman start to laugh. giles, not laughing,
     purposefully steps toward the woman, takes her arm.

                              giles (cont'd)
                  c'mon...


                                                   (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                  50.

58   continued:    (3)                                                  58

     ashley's pov - the woman relents.   giles helps her back toward
     the house.

     with kale - he's seeing it all.

                              kale
                      (whispering)
                  ashley, come on...

     with ashley - she glances down, eyes the car keys sparkling
     in the moonlight. she scoots toward them as --

     we crane up to reveal - giles - heading back toward the fence!

     on kale - seeing this.

     kale tries to get ashley's attention, but she's not looking --

     cu - ashley's hand - she reaches for the car keys --

     closer - ashley's fingertips barely touch them when --

     giles' hand - suddenly swoops in from o.s., brushes ashley's
     fingers just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back
     to his side!

     somehow ashley keeps herself from screaming as she yanks her
     hand back, presses herself against the fence. she puts her
     hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing --

     kale's pov - giles stands frozen in the shadows behind ashley.

     with ashley - she slowly turns her head, sees giles through
     one of the cracks -- standing right there.

     ashley starts to slowly sliiide away... when suddenly -- a
     twig snaps under her foot! ashley freezes. she peers back
     through the nearest crack.

     ashley's pov - searching for giles -- doesn't see him --

     ashley presses herself even harder against the fence as we...

     tilt up and pan over to reveal giles - peering over the fence.
     we can only hope it's tall enough to keep him from looking
     down and seeing ashley.

     with kale - he's seeing it all.

     on giles - he raises up, standing on his tip toes to get a
     better look down. shifting his head back and forth.

     with kale - he ducks behind the shrub, contemplating his
     next move. he glances down, picks up a large pebble. he
     pops out and tosses it over into giles' yard.

                                               (continued)    d.j. caruso

                                                                  51.

58   continued:    (4)                                                  58

     we hear it dropping through branches, scattering to the ground
     as kale ducks back behind the shrub, breathing hard. he
     then peers back out --

     his pov - giles lowers back down, turns and heads back toward
     the house.

     kale sighs in relief. waves ashley the "all clear." ashley
     heads back over to kale, breathless.

                              ashley
                      (oddly exhilarated)
                  that was intense.

                              kale
                  are you nuts?!

     ashley silences kale with a finger to his lips. she then
     leans in, gives him a peck on the cheek and bolts away --
     off kale, utterly stupefied --
