55   int. kale's bedroom - late afternoon - moments later               55

     ashley barges in, instantly struck by the mess. kale pushes
     past her, starts grabbing underwear and garbage off the floor.

                              kale
                  it's a little messy.

                                 ashley
                  a little?

     kale keeps gathering clothes, tossing them to ronnie who
     tosses them in the closet.

     ashley picks up the binoculars from the window sill, peers
     outside.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  anything interesting out there?

     kale and ronnie trade looks. ashley turns around, binoculars
     still raised, aiming them like a gun at kale.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  are you spying on the neighbors,
                  kale?

     kale freezes.

                              ronnie
                      (stepping in)
                  actually, he is.

     kale's eyes widen in panic.

                              ronnie (cont'd)
                  see, he has this neighbor -- who i
                  guess by definition would also be
                  your neighbor -- who may, in point
                  of fact, be a cold-blooded killer.

                                 ashley
                  is that so.

     ronnie points out the window to giles' house.

                              ronnie
                  exhibit a, robert giles.

                              ashley
                  yeah, i've seen him.   so?

                              kale
                  so you hear about that missing girl
                  from madison?

                              ashley
                      (realizing; then
                       pointing out to giles')
                  what, you think he --

                              kale
                  he drives a car like the one she was
                  seen in.

                              ronnie
                  black mustang.

                              kale
                  60's era mustang.

                              ashley
                  gee, that really narrows it down.

                              kale
                  they said it was dented.     his has a
                  bashed-in fender.

                              ashley
                      (re: binoculars)
                  so this is why -- you're --

     suddenly seeing something o.s., kale rips the binoculars out
     of ashley's hand, goes to the window.

                              ronnie
                  what?

     binocular pov - giles pulls the silver toyota out of the
     garage and out the driveway.

     ashley suddenly grabs the binoculars from kale, peers out.

                              kale
                  hey --

                              ashley
                  so that's the infamous black mustang,
                  huh?

                              kale
                  yeah --



                                                   (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                   40.

                              ashley
                  the one with no dent?

                              kale
                      (grabbing the binocs)
                  what?

     binocular pov - sure enough, the mustang no longer has a
     bashed-in fender. the garage door starts to close --

                              kale (cont'd)
                  how'd he fix it so fast --

                               ashley
                  because it was never there in the
                  first place?

     kale eyes ashley. shit, could he have imagined it?       ashley
     playfully grabs the binoculars back from kale.

     binocular pov - ashley catches a glimpse of a faded texas
     longhorns bumper sticker.

                              ashley (cont'd)
                  sorry guys, no bashed-in fender,
                  just a longhorns bumper sticker.

                               kale
                      (grabbing the binocs)
                  you serious?
                      (then to ronnie)
                  she's right.

     their pov - giles' garage door finally slams closed.

                              kale (cont'd)
                      (off ashley's
                       questioning look)
                  they think it might be linked to
                  some murders in texas two years ago.

                              ronnie
                  austin, texas. texas longhorns.

     kale and ronnie eye ashley as if to say "see?"      ashley eyes
     them another beat -- then:

                              ashley
                  okay, fine, stakeout.
                      (grabs binoculars)
                  who's on my shift?

     off kale and ronnie, their dreams realized --



                                                                d.j. caruso
