88   ext. giles' back yard - garage - night - short time later             88

     on the garage door - as it slowly raises up.

     wider - the uniforms, standing with kale, wait as the door
     opens all the way.

     a light comes on inside. giles and uniform #1 come out the
     inner garage door as uniform #2 giles drags the blue bag out
     from the garage.

     sure enough, there's blood smears and visible strands of
     matted hair near the top. uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls
     the sides away. everyone gathers around, peers inside, then
     suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible stench emanating
     from within.

     kale eyes uniform #1 who gestures him to look.       kale steps
     toward the bag.

     kale's pov - we peer into the bag to reveal the wide open
     eyes of a dead -- deer.

                              giles
                      (to the cops)
                  i hit it the other night. thought
                  i'd save a few steps and get it off
                  the road myself. i was gonna bury
                  it sooner, but it's been a helluva
                  week --

                              kale
                  so why'd you have to have the car
                  fixed in record time, huh? because
                  it was covered in her blood --

                              giles
                      (talking over him;
                       re: mustang)
                  because it's a classic, i got it out
                  of storage for the auto show, i needed
                  it in pristine condition.

                              uniform #2
                  it's one of the biggest in the world.
                      (off uniform #1)
                  the auto show.

     all eyes on kale.    he slumps.   giles has an answer for
     everything.

                              uniform #1
                  i think we're done here.   sorry for
                  the intrusion, sir.

                              giles
                  please, i understand.

     as the uniforms lead kale back down the driveway...

                               kale
                      (quietly; drained)
                  so where's my friend, then? can
                  anyone tell me that? does anyone
                  believe me?!

     kale looks over, sees parker, standing with julie whose eyes
     are filled with it all: anger, concern, sadness...

                              julie
                  kale, come on --

     kale turns back to giles' house. sees lights being turned
     out inside. as kale shifts his gaze forward, he locks eyes
     with ashley standing in the crowd of neighbors. she watches
     him with concern. kale turns away, drops his head as the
     cops, parker and julie lead him away... a flash of lightning
     in the distance...
