14   int. kale's bedroom - night - later                                14

     kales sits in his video game chair, wearing his x-box live
     headset, playing halo 2 -- he's on the final "boss level."
     gunfire and explosions blare over his stereo speakers.

                           kale
                   (into headset as needed)
               hobby, you read me? i said come
               around my left flank and draw his
               fire -- damn straight i'm trying to
               get you smoked, you've been hiding
               behind my ass the whole game --

     the tv screen suddenly glitches.

                           kale (cont'd)
               hobby, jet, you guys still there?

     the screen goes black. the xbox live logo appears along
     with the words: server error. kale throws the headset aside,
     makes sure all the wires are connected. checks the tv screen.
     same thing.

     kale glares at the screen another beat, then gets up, wanders
     out of his room...
