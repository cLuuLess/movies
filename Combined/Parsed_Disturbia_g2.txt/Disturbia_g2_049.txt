52   int. kale's bedroom - night - short time later                      52

     kale enters, grabs his psp and falls back to the bed. as he
     starts playing, headlight beams appear from o.s. he glances
     out the window:

     kale's pov - a black 1965 mustang convertible pulls in giles'
     driveway.

     kale goes back to playing the psp, then suddenly stops --

                              kale
                      (realizing)
                   -- mustang --

     kale hops up, heads to the window --

     kale's pov - kale watches as giles hops out, leaves the car
     running as he heads inside the house.

     after a beat, the main garage door raises up. giles appears,
     ducking underneath, heads back to the mustang, gets in.
     giles maneuvers the car around the driveway. the front end
     of the car swings around, revealing a bashed-in right front
     fender.

                               kale (cont'd)
                  holy shit.   a dent --

     kale races to his closet, pulls down a pair of binoculars,
     heads back to the window.

     binocular pov - in the garage, giles is already out of the
     car, rounding the back as the garage door lowers... kale
     crouches, trying to see under the closing door... catching a
     glimpse of giles popping the trunk --

     a hand

     suddenly enters frame, lands on kale's shoulder! kale
     screams, whips around -- julie. she screams, too.

               kale (cont'd)                     julie
       jesus, mom!                       christ, kale!

                               julie (cont'd)
                  i'm sorry.   i thought you heard me...

                               kale
                  what?   no, i --

                              julie
                  what's going on?

                              kale
                  nothing, just watching the wind blow.

                              julie
                      (re: binoculars)
                  anything else?


                                                 (continued)   d.j. caruso

                                                                  33.

     kale turns back.

     his pov -    giles' garage door is now closed.

                              kale
                  no, see for yourself.

                              julie
                      (beat; then)
                  that's okay, i just... wanted to say
                  good night.

     julie leaves.    kale turns back to the window, stares out at
     giles' house.    the lights go out.
