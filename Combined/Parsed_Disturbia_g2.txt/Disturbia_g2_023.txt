27   int. kale's bedroom - day - later                                  27

     kale sits on his bed, staring into space. he eyes the clock.
     tick tick tick... we hear kids playing in the street o.s.

     kale glances out the window.

     his pov - kids on bikes, neighbors out on walks... ahh...
     the sights and sounds of summer... and kale's not invited.
     he glares down at his ankle bracelet. it glares back.
