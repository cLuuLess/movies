          ext. southwest bank
          
          carl's eating lunch at a picnic table outside. several bank
          employees smoke cigarettes near him. an oddly hyper guy
          named alex approaches carl.
          
                              alex
                    carl kendall?
          
                              carl
                    alex eberts? what's up, buddy?
          
          alex hugs carl.
          
                              alex
                    too much! how've you been? i
                    can't believe you're still working
                    here.
          
                              carl
                    where've you been? norman's been
                    heartbroken since you quit.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
                              alex
                    where've i been? you mean, where
                    haven't i been? this year. dude.
                    i have lived. i climbed mt.
                    kilmanjaro. i ate bat in laos. i
                    shot a cow with a bazooka. i'm not
                    proud of that last one but i did
                    it. how's the bank?
          
                              carl
                    same old same old.
          
                              alex
                    see? that's the problem. that's
                    everyone's problem. you've got one
                    life. why waste it on the same old
                    same old?
          
          alex hands carl a pamphlet for a "just say yes" seminar.
          
                              alex (cont'd)
                    i know this will sound queer, but
                    you have to hit this seminar. it
                    changed my life. it will change
                    yours. unless you like the bank.
          
                               carl
                    you kidding? every day it's
                    impossible not to throw rocks at
                    the place.
                        (joking)
                    since you don't work here anymore,
                    you want to throw a couple?
          
                              alex
                    yes.
          
          alex starts whipping rocks at the bank.
          
                              carl
                    what're you doing!   stop that!   i
                    was kidding!
          
          norman comes out.
          
                              norman
                    what do you think you're doing?
                        (recognizing alex)
                    alex eberts! is this an alumnae
                    prank? i love pranks!
          
                              alex
                    hey, norman!
          
                                                                    12.
          
          
          
          alex continues throwing rocks at the bank.
          
                              norman
                        (into a walkie-talkie)
                    we have a situation.
          
          a couple portly security guards come out and wrestle alex to
          the ground. he manages to escape and run from the bank.
          
                              alex
                    go to the seminar, carl!    you won't
                    be sorry!
