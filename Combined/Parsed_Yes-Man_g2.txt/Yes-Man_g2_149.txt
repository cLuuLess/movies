          chyron: some time later
          
          carl has set up a makeshift loan office.   he's sitting across
          from a young thai man.
          
                              young thai man
                        (in thai, with subtitles)
                    [i need ten thousand bhat to get my
                    first tuk tuk. if i get a tuk tuk
                    i no longer have to mop the ping
                    pong show floor and clean the
                    snake.]
          
                              carl
                        (in thai, with subtitles)
                    [what snake?]
          
                              young thai man
                        (in thai, with subtitles)
                    [you don't want to know.]
          
                                                                 131.
          
          
          
          pull back to reveal that norman sits at the table next to
          carl working with an old thai man.
          
                              norman
                        (in thai, with subtitles)

                              old thai man
                        (in thai, with subtitles)
                    [if i like it will you give me
                    money to fix my fishing boat?]
          
          
          epilogue: ext. nigerian palace
          
          chyron: makurdi, nigeria
          
          carl and renee get out a dusty minivan. a dirty, rundown
          palace rises before them. carl heads to the front door and
          hits the buzzer. a guard with a machine gun opens up.
          
                              machine gun guard
                    what do you want?
          
                              carl
                    i'm here to see omar.   the former
                    king of nigeria.
          
          omar, the former king of nigeria, a large, boisterous man,
          comes up from behind the guard.
          
                              omar, former king of nigeria
                    is that carl kendall?
          
                              carl
                    omar! it's wonderful to meet you
                    in person
          
          carl and omar hug.
          
                              omar, former king of nigeria
                    and this must be renee? what a
                    delight!
          
          omar bends on one knee and kisses renee on the hand.
          
                              renee
                    thank you, your majesty.
          
                              omar, former king of nigeria
                    please, call me omar.
          
                                                                   132.
          
          
          
                              carl
                    i'm sorry for calling you a
                    masturbatory russian teenager.
          
                              omar, former king of nigeria
                    water under the bridge. what do
                    you say to having a feast?
          
          carl, omar, renee and the guard go into omar's palace. the
          door closes behind them.
