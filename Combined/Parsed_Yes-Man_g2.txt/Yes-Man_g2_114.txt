          int. airport
          
          carl and renee walk off the plane, carl carrying the package
          under his arm. carl sees a tall blond guy holding a sign
          that says "sheldon winkleton." he heads towards the guy but
          before he can several dea agents with adorable, drug sniffing
          dogs surround carl. the dogs start barking like mad.
          
                                 dea agent
                       put the package down!    put it down!
          
          carl looks up to see "sheldon" walking swiftly out the
          sliding doors of the airport.
          
                                 dea agent (cont'd)
                       get on the ground! both of you!
          
          the dea agents kick the box open. chocolates spill out over
          the ground. they crack open the chocolates to reveal tiny
          baggies of cocaine.
          
                                 renee
                       what the hell is that?
          
                                 carl
                       i don't know!
          
          as carl is dragged out by the cops, he passes tony, standing
          near the exit, shaking his head.
          
                                                                 109.
