          the vps are sitting around the board room.    carl comes in,
          late, still covered in clay.
          
                              carl
                    sorry about that.

                    carl, i'm glad you could join us.
                    so, to keep you all updated, we
                    should be merging with korean bank
                    international within the year.
          
          everyone claps.
          
                                                                    115.
          
          
          
                              chris parker (cont'd)
                    as per our argument with kbi, we'll
                    be shoring up our bottom line.
                    carl kendall's done us the honor of
                    drawing up a preliminary list of
                    the branches that are on the
                    chopping block. nice work, carl.
          
          carl looks horrified.
