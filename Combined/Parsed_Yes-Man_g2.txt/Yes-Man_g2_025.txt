                    external is manipulated through our
                    choices. and our choices start
                    with one word.
          
          the music abruptly switches to the opening beats of "jump" by
          the pointer sisters. the rosy colored lights flip to bright
          white and sweep across the convention center room. it is
          suddenly like a rock concert. sanji (50s) busts through the
          giant banner. the whole crowd starts cheering.
          
                               sanji (cont'd)
                    yes!
          
          instead of "jump", sanji's yelling "yes!"
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    say yes! for your life! yes!
                    change starts now! yes! yes!
                    yes! say it with me! say yes!
          
          sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks go
          off. the crowd jumps on their feet.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    are you ready to open the door to
                    yes?
          
                                                                      17.
          
          
          
                                 crowd
                    yes!
          
                              sanji
                    i am sorry, my friends.      but i
                    cannot hear you?
          
                                 crowd
                    yes!
          
                                 sanji
                    shhhhhhh.
          
          the crowd quiets.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    now is the time when we must greet
                    our new members. who here is new?
                    please, do not be shy.
          
                                 wiry, crunchy woman
                    he is!
          
          the woman points at carl.      the spotlight swings over to carl.
          he is annoyed.
          
                              sanji
                    come on up, future yes man!
          
                                 carl
                    that's ok.     i'm just auditing.
          
                              sanji
                    you can't audit life!      now get on
                    up here!
          
                              carl
                    i'm cool right here.
          
                              sanji
                    then i will come to you!
          
          sanji runs off the stage and joins carl in the back of the
          conference hall. the spotlights follow him.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    what is your name?
          
                                 carl
                    carl.
          
                                                           18.
          
          
          
                              sanji
                    let me guess, carl. this was not
                    your idea to come here, carl.
          
                              carl
                    i wouldn't say that.
          
                              sanji
                    you can tell me, carl.    we are all
                    alone, carl.
          
          the crowd laughs.
          
                              carl
                    it wasn't exactly my idea.
          
                              sanji
                    that's what i thought, carl. and
                    you think this is all bullshit,
                    carl, isn't that right, carl?
          
                                carl
                    honestly?
          
                              sanji
                    is there any other way?
          
                              carl
                    this whole thing seems retarded.
          
                              sanji
                    but you are stuck in your life,
                    carl? am i right?
          
                              carl
                    i wouldn't necessarily --
          
                              sanji
                    you once had a dream? you wanted
                    to own a boat? a house? a fancy
                    car? you wanted to a doctor, a
                    lawyer... a business man?
          
          carl nods, surprised at sanji's incisiveness.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    you wanted to be more than you are.
                    and yet you have suddenly woken up
                    to find life is passing you by. am
                    i right, carl?
          
                                                                       19.
          
          
          
          sanji's suddenly getting to carl. as sanji talks to him, the
          moment between them becomes more and more intimate. it
          should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared.
          
                                carl
                    a little.
          
                              sanji
                    it's odd that ten years can pass
                    just like that.
          
          sanji snaps.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    isn't it, carl?
          
                                carl
                    it is.
          
                              sanji
                    i want you to do something for me,
                    carl. tomorrow, i want you only to
                    say yes. can you do that for me?
                    for one day, carl?
          
                              carl
                    i'm not sure --
          
                              sanji
                    please, carl. do it for me and you
                    will be doing it for yourself. if
                    you don't have the best day in ten
                    years then i am the uncle of a
                    monkey. will you do it for me
                    carl? just for a day?
          
                                carl
                    yes?
          
          sanji grabs carl hand and pulls him to his feet.   we pull
          back and the crowd cheers.
          
                              sanji
                    welcome to the world of yes!
          
          fireworks and confetti go off.    the wiry, anxious woman gives
          carl a creepy thumbs up.
