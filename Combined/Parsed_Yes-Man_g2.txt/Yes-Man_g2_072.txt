          int. peter's law office
          
          carl's sitting across from peter in peter's fancy law office.
          they're each eating burgers.
          
                              peter
                    what's with the kitten?
          
          pull back to reveal a kitten on peter's desk.
          
                              carl
                    i just adopted her. if you're
                    interested, they're giving them
                    away in front of petco.
          
                              peter
                    i don't want a kitten.
          
                              carl
                    neither did i.
          
                              peter's secretary
                    andy solomon on line two.
          
          peter picks up the phone.
          
                              peter
                    hey, asshole, we're not talking
                    until you sign that goddamn
                    contract.
          
          peter hangs up.
          
                              peter (cont'd)
                        (totally normal)
                    i spoke to kath. i hear you met
                    her boyfriend, seb.
          
                              carl
                    seems like a nice guy.
          
                                                                 69.
          
          
          
                              peter
                    she was upset you went on her date.
          
                              carl
                    he asked me to join them.
          
                              peter
                    i think you're taking this too far.
          
                              carl
                    i have no choice. i'm a yes man.
                    i must say yes. if seb asks me to
                    join them on their date, i must.
                    if some dude asks me for a loan i
                    have to give it to them even if
                    it's clearly never going to be paid
                    back. if a guy asks me into his
                    bedroom, i must hook up with him.
          
                              peter
                    you hooked up with a dude?
          
                              carl
                    it's like hooking up with a strong
                    woman. i honestly don't see what
                    the big deal is.
                        (back on his yes rant)
                    i am guided by yes. yes has become
                    my superpower. and let me tell,
                    yes is turning out to be a pretty
                    sweet deal. now if you'll excuse
                    me i'm late for korean class.
          
                              peter
                    you hate korean food.
          
                              carl
                    that's no reason to write off an
                    entire, vibrant culture. see you
                    later, buddy.
          
          carl heads off, the kitten under his arm.
