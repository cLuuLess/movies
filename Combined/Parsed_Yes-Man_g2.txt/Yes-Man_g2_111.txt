          int. lincoln airport
          
          carl's sitting in the lounge at the lincoln airport.    an old
          woman comes up to him.
          
                              old woman
                    excuse me. would you mind bringing
                    this to my son?
          
          the old woman hands carl an unmarked, shady-looking package.
          
                              carl
                    like you want me to bring it with
                    me? on the plane?
          
                              old woman
                    fedex is so expensive and this
                    needs to get to him today.
          
                              carl
                        (very nervous)
                    yeah. sure. i'd be happy to.
          
                              old woman
                    he's a tall, blond fellow named
                    sheldon winkleton. he'll be
                    holding a sign in the terminal with
                    his name on it. you are a dear.
          
          the old woman shuffles off.    carl looks at the box.   renee
          returns.
          
                              renee
                    i got us weekly, star and, for a
                    little culture, the national
                    enquirer.
          
                              carl
                    national enquirer?
          
                              renee
                    they have movie reviews.    what's in
                    the package?
          
                              carl
                    just a gift for some buddies back
                    home.
          
                                                                   108.
