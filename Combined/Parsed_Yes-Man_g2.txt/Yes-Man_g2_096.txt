                              chris parker (cont'd)

                    kim, joo-chan park, soo lee and
                    seung kim. seung's the ceo of

          the koreans shake carl's hand.
          
                              carl
                        (in korean, with
                         subtitles)

          the koreans all start speaking korean at carl.   carl clearly
          doesn't understand what they're saying.
