          int. carl's living room/bedroom
          
          carl lies down.       the alarm flips on.
          
          quick cuts:
          
          -- in dunkin donuts
          
                                   carl
                       no.
          
          -- on the street. carl refuses the pamphlet.
          
          -- in southwest bank
          
                                 norman
                       dress as your favorite animal --
          
                                   carl
                       sorry.
          
          -- close on the clock.      it flips to 5:00.
          
          -- at home
          
          carl eats frozen lasagna while watching the amazing race.
          
                                                                        9.
          
          
          
          the images start to move faster:
          
          -- carl in dunkin donuts.
          
          -- carl at southwest bank talking to norman.
          
                              norman
                    -- historical figure --
          
                                 carl
                    no can do.
          
          the clock flipping to 5:00.
          
          -- carl at home eating frozen meatloaf and watching project
          runway.
          
          -- carl's head hitting his bed.
          
          -- carl waking up.
          
          -- carl shaking his head `no.'
          
          -- the clock flipping to 5:00.
          
          -- carl's head hitting the bed.
          
          -- the alarm going off.
          
          it's now just a blur of images of carl at southwest bank,
          shaking his head `no', eating lean cuisine and watching
          reality television.
