          int. southwest bank - conference room
          
          carl walks into the crowded room.   korean executives and
          southwest bank executives mingle.   carl heads towards chris.
          
                              carl
                    i need to talk to you.
          
                              chris parker
                    and i need to talk to you. you
                    mind doing a little ceremonial
                    translating?
          
                              carl
                    i don't know if i'm good enough at
                    korean --
          
                              chris parker
                    believe in yourself and the world
                    believes in you.
          
          seung sees carl and bows to him. carl bows back. the pretty
          korean banker sees carl and coquettishly waves to him.
          chris taps the microphone. the crowd sits down.
          
                                                                   126.
          
          
          
                              chris parker (cont'd)
                    i'd like to welcome our new
                    partners into the southwest family.
          
          chris nods to carl.

          carl takes a beat.    chris looks at him, expectantly.

                    we have a traitor in our midst.
                    this man just called me a son of a
                    dog and informed me that my hand is
                    covered in fecal matter. he is
                    clearly trying to sabotage the
                    merger.
          
                              carl
                    you speak english?
          
                              seung kim

                    financier wouldn't speak fluent
                    english? for whom do you work,
                    traitor? shanghai bank?

                    fine. keep it secret.
                    unfortunately, i cannot approve a
                    merger with a company so
                    incompetent as to have a business
                    saboteur this high up. good day.
          
          seung kim walks out, followed by all his employees.   before
          chris can say anything...
