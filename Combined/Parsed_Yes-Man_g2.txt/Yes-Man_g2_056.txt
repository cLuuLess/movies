          int. the note bar and performance space - night
          
          carl stands at the back of a basically empty dive bar,
          nursing a beer. there's a makeshift stage at the front of
          the bar. "the flying buttresses" are setting up their
          equipment, including a giant clear plastic harp. renee steps
          up to the microphone.
          
                              renee
                    hello jake, penelope, carl and
                    rodrigo. we are the flying
                    buttresses!
          
          their four audience members cheer. the drummer bangs his
          sticks together and the band launches in. they are terrible.
          like really terrible. renee sings in a high-pitched voice
          that she probably thinks sounds like tori amos, but sounds
          more like a dog whistle. if you've heard the singer, joanna
          newsom, well that's who she's emulating.
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                        (singing)
                    everyday, the unicorns they
                    play/among lingonberry fields/they
                    silently bay/the king has no
                    crown/just a vest of grass/the
                    queen loves the jester/the jester
                    has the last laugh.
                        (chorus)
                    you are my minotaur/with your
                    cloven hooves!/half man, half
                    horse/you are all boy to me
          
          carl looks at the three other audience members. they are
          nodding along. also, one of them is dressed like a court
          jester.
          
          cut to later
          
          renee's whisper singing.
          
                                                                  51.
          
          
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                    a witches cauldron/burns hot as
                    hell/as her crooked hand/brews a
                    love spell.
          
          cut to later
          
          renee's singing a power ballad.
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                    i! am!   a! fairy!/i! like!    to
                    fly!
          
          the four people in the audience clap hard as she finishes.
          renee takes a huge bow and motions to her fellow band mates.
          carl, not knowing how to politely react to the horror show he
          just witnessed, claps along. renee gets off the stage and
          walks over to the bar, right next to carl.
          
                              bartender
                    nice, show renee. one virgin mint
                    soda coming right up.
          
                              renee
                    i don't think i hit a high enough
                    octave in fairy dream song.
          
                              carl
                    i disagree. i think you hit some
                    pretty high octaves.
          
                              renee
                    but i can hit like way higher.
                        (as she speaks her voice
                         goes higher and higher)
                    like check this out. i think this
                    tone might be more appropriate for
                    my water nymph song?
          
                              carl
                        (speaking in a low voice)
                    i don't know -- i've known some
                    water nymphs with big balls.
                        (no reaction)
                    from the high level of
                    testosterone.
          
          an awkward moment where renee doesn't react and carl thinks
          he may have offended her. suddenly she starts laughing
          spazzily hard. carl smiles.
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
          
                              renee
                    i've got to write a song about
                    that. i could call it...
          
                              carl
                    "big balled water nymph"?       it's a
                    working title.
          
                                 renee
                    i like it.     i can work with that.
          
          the drummer, a guy named leeore, shouts down to renee from
          the stage.
          
                               leeore
                    um, excuse me, but we have to clear
                    the stage.
          
                              renee
                    i gotta clear.
                        (joking)
                    unless of course, you want to help?
          
                               carl
                    sure.   i love clearing stages.
          
          carl helps a surprised renee clear the stage.
