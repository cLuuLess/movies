                       what the hell happened?
          
                                 carl
                       i can explain.
          
                                 renee
                       so explain. are you a drug
                       smuggler?
          
                                                          111.
          
          
          
                              carl
                    look, when the nice lady asked me
                    to take them on the plane, i
                    thought they were chocolates.
          
                              renee
                    you expect me to believe a nice
                    lady asked you to bring chocolates
                    on a plane?
          
                              carl
                    i know how it sounds.
          
                              renee
                    i don't think you do.
          
          carl just looks at her.
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                    if you can't be honest with me,
                    then you and the nice lady can have
                    a fun life in candyland.
          
          renee starts off.
          
                                 carl
                    wait!     i'll explain better.
          
          she turns back around.
