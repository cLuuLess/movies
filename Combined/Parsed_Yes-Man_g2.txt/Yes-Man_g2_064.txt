          int. cafe - morning
          
          carl sits across from an iranian women.
          
                              iranian woman
                    it was delightful meeting you,
                    carl.
          
                              carl
                    as it was meeting you farinoush.
          
                              iranian woman
                    although i must say i was surprised
                    to discover that you are in no way
                    persian. nor are you six foot two.
                    you should change that on your
                    profile.
          
                                carl
                    will do.    should i call you?
          
                              iranian woman
                    sorry, i want a tall guy.
          
          the iranian woman leaves, passing lucy.
          
                              lucy
                    who was that?
          
                              carl
                    farinoush azzam. great girl, but i
                    don't think we're right for each
                    other.
          
                              lucy
                    how'd you meet?
          
                              carl
                    persianwifefinder.com.
                        (ignoring her odd look)
                    let's talk wedding shower.
          
                              lucy
                    so, i know it's just a wedding
                    shower, so who cares really?
                    and it's like so lame? but i've
                    made an appointment at a stationery
                    store. are you going to totally
                    kill me?
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
                              carl
                        (dripping with sarcasm)
                    you kidding? i love stationery.
          
          lucy gets up.   carl follows her.   he does not look happy.
