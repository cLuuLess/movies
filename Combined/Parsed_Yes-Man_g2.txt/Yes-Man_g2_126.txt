                    we have to protest the merger.   get
                    some grassroots action going.
                    grass looks weak, but it grows
                    everywhere.
          
                              carl
                    you don't even work at the bank.
          
                              norman
                    you should protest with us!
          
                              rooney
                    yeah! protest with your employees!
                    it will only make you more popular!
