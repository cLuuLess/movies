          int. rudy's - moments later
          
          rudy's is a dive bar. dartboard, pool table, scuffed wooden
          floors, miller lite sign, etc. the patrons are all facing
          the giant television. the new year's ball is dropping.
          among the patrons is our hero carl, his best friend peter,
          peter's girlfriend lucy, their party friend rooney and his ex-
          girlfriend, kath who's still a little red-eyed.
          
                              patrons
                    three, two, one... happy new year!
          
          everyone blows noisemakers and pops champagne.
          
                              patrons (cont'd)
                        (singing)
                    should auld acquaintance be forgot
                    and never brought to mind? should
                    auld acquaintance be forgot and
                    days of auld lang syne?
          
                              carl
                    well, that was fantastic.   good
                    night, guys.
          
                              peter
                    you're going, already?
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          
                              kath
                    we haven't even finished the song
                    yet.
          
                              carl
                    i saw the ball drop and hugged all
                    of you. aliens didn't invade. our
                    computers are still working. what
                    else could possibly happen?
          
                              lucy
                    rooney might throw up.
          
                                 rooney
                    it's true.     i'm very close.
          
                              carl
                    i see that happen like every night.
                    good night and happy new year.
          
          carl leaves.   his friends look concerned.
          
                              lucy
                    how did he take the break-up?
          
                              kath
                        (crying)
                    like a robot. two years, and
                    nothing.
          
                              lucy
                    i'm so sorry.
