          int. carl's living room/bedroom - night
          
          carl's lying on his bed.      the phone is ringing.   he gets up
          and answers.
          
                                 carl
                    hello?
          
                              peter (v.o.)
                        (on the phone)
                    carl. it's peter. where are you?
          
                              carl
                    i'm in bed. why?       what happened?
                    did someone die?
          
                                                                     10.
          
          
          
                              peter (v.o.)
                        (on the phone)
                    no. it's just -- we're at rudy's.
                    celebrating new year's.
          
          carl looks at the alarm.     it's 11:15 pm.
          
                              carl
                    it's already 11:15.     i don't think
                    i can make it.
          
                              peter
                    oh, c'mon, carl. no one's seen you
                    for like forever. please swing by?
          
                                carl
                    no.
          
          titles up: the yes man
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    tell everyone happy new year.
          
          carl lies down and hangs up the phone.
          
          cut to later
          
          carl watches his alarm clock flip to 12:00am.     he closes his
          eyes and goes to sleep.
