          int. stackers - later
          
          carl, peter, lucy and kath are still waiting with a big crowd
          of people to sit down for brunch.
          
                              carl
                    why do people wait an hour for
                    breakfast? it's so hot and bright
                    and we haven't even had coffee yet.
          
                              peter
                    if you don't want to be here, you
                    don't have to be.
          
                              carl
                    of course i want to be here. i
                    love waiting an hour for eggs.
                    it's fun. although i will point
                    out that you have sunglasses which
                    is probably making this wait a lot
                    easier.
          
                              peter
                    oakleys, polarized lenses,
                    indestructible. two fifty but
                    worth every penny.
          
          the waitress comes up.
          
                              waitress
                    lowell, party of five.
          
          a group of four people get up to be seated.
          
                              carl
                    we were definitely before those
                    lowell people.
          
                              kath
                    i hate when people jump ahead.
          
                              carl
                    why does no one ever say anything?
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
                              peter
                    if you want to be sitting so bad,
                    why don't you say something?
          
                               carl
                    yes.   i will.
          
          carl walks up to the waitress.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    excuse me, but we were here before
                    those people.
          
                              waitress
                    no you weren't.
          
                              carl
                    yes, we were.
          
                              waitress
                    i have the list, dude.   the list
                    doesn't lie.
          
          meanwhile, the customers the waitress was going to seat are
          looking away, trying not to get involved.
          
                              carl
                    well, this time the list lied.
          
                              lucy
                    it's ok, carl. it's just brunch.
          
                              carl
                        (to the people who are
                         being seated)
                    you all know that we were up before
                    you! and you have to live with
                    that knowledge through your
                    delightful brunch!
          
          peter pulls carl away from the waitress.
          
                              peter
                    what's going on with you?
          
                              carl
                    i just want transparency in terms
                    of the brunch seating order.
          
          one of the customers who was being seated heads over.
          
                                                                    23.
          
          
          
                             kath
                    great. now we're going to get into
                    a fight.
          
                              brunch dude
                    we talked about what you said...
                    you're right. you guys were here
                    before us. sorry we didn't pipe up
                    sooner. we cool, brother?
          
                              carl
                        (surprised)
                    yeah. we cool.
          
          carl and the brunch dude punch fists and hug.
