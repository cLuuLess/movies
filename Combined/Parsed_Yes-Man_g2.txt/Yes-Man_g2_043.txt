          int. carl's apartment - morning
          
          light is streaming in through the window. carl opens his
          eyes. he's in bad shape. he looks over to see the hot girl
          finishing getting dressed.
          
                              hot girl
                    my fiance called. he was like
                    really sorry about last night.      i
                    have to go.
          
                              carl
                    your fiance?
          
                              hot girl
                    domingo. the guy who punched you
                    in the face.
          
                              carl
                    i thought you said you two weren't
                    even dating?
          
                              hot girl
                    we were broken up last night.      it
                    was fun hanging out.
          
          the hot girl kisses carl on the forehead.
