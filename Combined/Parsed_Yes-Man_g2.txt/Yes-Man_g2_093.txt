          ext. fancy restaurant
          
          carl's outside with peter.
          
                              peter
                    nice job with renee. she's
                    definitely odd, but that's not
                    necessarily --
          
                                                91.
          
          
          
                    carl
          i just spent $1500 on dinner.
          
                     peter
          what?   why?
          
                    carl
          because the waiter asked me if i
          wanted the expensive wine and you
          weren't there to stop me!
          
                    peter
          don't get mad at me about it.   you
          can just stop.
          
                    carl
          no i can't. if i didn't say yes to
          the band flier, i never would have
          met renee. if i hadn't said yes to
          taking charge of bank day care and
          then yes to becoming a loan
          specialist and then yes to the
          president's golf trip, i wouldn't
          be moving up. each yes leads to
          the next one. if i stop, it could
          all fall apart.
          
                    peter
          you've gone from a passive guy who
          always said no to a passive guy who
          always says yes. just saying yes
          is not a legitimate life
          philosophy.
          
                    carl
          i don't know why i should be taking
          advice from a guy who's wife is
          pissed he's not involved at all
          with the wedding planning.
          
                    peter
          i'm involved.
          
                    carl
          you told her you don't care whether
          the invite's cream or ivory.
          
                    peter
          i can't see the difference.
              (opening up)
          honestly, i'm terrified.
          
                                                                      92.
          
          
          
                               carl
                    what?   why?
          
                              peter
                    it's marriage, you know?   the
                    biggest thing ever.
          
                              carl
                    but you guys have dated for years.
          
                               peter
                    i know.
          
                              carl
                    you're perfect for each other.
          
                               peter
                    i know.
          
                              carl
                    she's terrified too.
          
                               peter
                    really?
          
                              carl
                    of course she is. i think you'll
                    both be a lot less terrified if
                    you're terrified together.
          
                              peter
                    but what if i really can't tell the
                    difference between ivory and cream?
                    does that make me a bad husband?
          
                              carl
                    what matters is that you pretend
                    you can see the difference.
          
          the girls and seb come out from the restaurant with their
          coats on. there's a silent beat.
          
                              girls
                        (high pitched goodbyes)
                    it was wonderful meeting you!/i
                    loved it!/let me know when you
                    throw your next art thing!
          
          everyone gets into their cars.   carl and renee walk off.
          
                              renee
                    it was great meeting your friends.
          
                                                                  93.
          
          
          
                              carl
                    they're a little stiff.
          
          beat.
          
                              renee
                    they are a little stiff.   what do
                    you feel like doing?
          
                              carl
                    i'm actually going rollerblading
                    with ralph.
          
                              renee
                    ralph?
          
                              carl
                    you know, crazy rollerblading
                    guitar man.
          
                              renee
                    the guy who plays at the promenade?
          
                              carl
                    any interest?
          
                              renee
                    no. it's ten on a friday night.
                    and that guy's crazy. don't you
                    want to go home and make out?
          
                              carl
                    yes.
