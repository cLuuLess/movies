          int. fancy restaurant - later
          
          everyone's drinking the wine.    carl's terrified of the bill.
          
                                                                90.
          
          
          
                              lucy
                    do you rent or own?
          
                                renee
                    i sublet.    i have this corner of a
                    loft.
          
                              carl
                    it's a really nice corner though.
          
                              lucy
                    if you're ever interested in
                    buying, you should ring me up.
          
                              renee
                    i hate owning things. because when
                    you own something, you suddenly are
                    invested in that thing not
                    breaking. and i break everything.
                    i've gone through three tvs in
                    three years.
          
                              seb
                    how did you break them?
          
                              renee
                    i smashed one with a hammer,
                    dropped one off my roof and the
                    third one just went on the fritz.
                    so i set it on fire.
          
          carl's friends don't really know what to say. the check
          comes. carl grabs it before anyone else can. it's a $1500
          bill. he drops several credit cards down on the table.
          
                              carl
                    it's on me!
                        (quietly to the waiter)
                    i'd like to split it between an
                    advanta blue business, mastercard,
                    a diners club and my south dakota
                    bank visa check card.
