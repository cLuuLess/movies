          int. plane
          
          carl and renee sit next to each other on the plane.
          
                                 renee
                       i'm sorry, i have to go to the
                       bathroom.
          
          renee heads to the bathroom. carl takes the package out from
          under the seat in front of him. he starts to breathe really
          hard. he very gingerly opens the package. he pulls back the
          packing peanuts revealing... a box of homemade chocolates.
          carl breathes a sigh of relief.
