          chris and carl follow the koreans.
          
                              chris parker
                    you speak korean?
          
                              carl
                    just a little.
          
                              chris parker
                    you sneaky devil. i knew i should
                    watch my back around you.
          
                              carl
                    is it a problem if i've never
                    played golf before?
          
                              chris parker
                    you're a funny one, carl kendall.
                    remember, they have to win. in
                    asian cultures, there's a concept
                    called saving face. you have to
                    let them win. but if they smell
                    for a second that you haven't tried
                    your hardest, they'll commit hari
                    kari.
          
                              carl
                    metaphorically?
          
                              chris parker
                    who knows? it's a delicate
                    balance, kendall. like two little
                    girls on a see saw with a crocodile
                    beneath them. make the wrong move,
                    and the little girl will end up in
                    the croc's maw.
