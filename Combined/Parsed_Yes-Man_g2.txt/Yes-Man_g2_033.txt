          ext. street
          
          carl walks out of dunkin donuts, carrying a giant coffee and
          several boxes of munchkins. he walks by renee, the cute girl
          who hands out band fliers.
          
                              renee
                    want a flier? oh, it's you.    never
                    mind.
          
                              carl
                    of course i'll take a flier.
          
          carl takes a flier.   renee's surprised carl's taking a flier.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                        (reading)
                    the flying buttresses.
          
                              renee
                    i knew after a year and a half of
                    wearing you down, you'd give in.
                    i'm renee by the way.
          
          renee holds out her hand.
          
                                carl
                    carl.
          
                              renee
                    carl. cool. i like to thank
                    everyone personally who comes to
                    our performances. it gives it a
                    nice intimate touch. see you soon
                    carl.
          
          carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation.
          he takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces.
