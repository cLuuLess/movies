          carl's trying to keep up as the customer launches into
          intense finance-speak.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
          
                              bank customer
                    i want to refi my house and spend
                    the capital on my personal
                    business. i see you've got a 5.25
                    7 year arm, but over at chase
                    they're offering 5.00 7 year arm.
                    can you refi lower, like at 4.85
                    par example, or am i going to have
                    to bring my beeswax elsewhere?
          
                                carl
                    yes.
          
                               bank customer
                    yes?   that's it?
          
                               carl
                    yup.   what's your business?
          
                              bank customer
                    selling beanie babies online.
          
                                carl
                    adorable.
          
                              bank customer
                    more like highly profitable.    i've
                    crunched the numbers.
          
          the woman hands over a scrapbook that's been decorated with
          construction paper and pictures of beanie babies. carl opens
          the scrapbook. it's filled with numbers.
          
                              carl
                    let me just get final approval on
                    this.
          
          carl gets up and walks over to norman.
          
          angle on norman's office
          
          carl stands before norman.
          
                              norman
                    you're a teller, not a loan
                    specialist.
          
                              carl
                    no, i know, so if you think this is
                    a bad idea for a loan that's fine
                    but can you please tell her
                    yourself?
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          
                              norman
                    what's this?
          
                              carl
                    her business plan.
          
          norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it.
          
                              norman
                    inta-maresting. my grandma loves
                    beanie babies. although
                    unfortunately, we have a minimum
                    loan floor of ten thousand dollars.
                    she only wants five.
          
                              carl
                    that's silly. how're you supposed
                    to start a tiny business if you
                    can't get a tiny business loan?
          
                               norman
                    i don't make the rules, i just
                    break `em.
                        (then)
                    i don't break them. i just wanted
                    to rhyme. if she wants us to loan
                    her ten thousand or more, great.
                    otherwise, i think her only option
                    is a loan shark.
          
          angle on loan desk
          
          carl sits back down.
          
                              bank customer
                        (nervous)
                    so, what'd he say?
          
                              carl
                    do you maybe have any interest in
                    borrowing ten thousand?
          
                              bank customer
                    i can't afford the payments on ten.
                    you can't do five thousand? this
                    is the fifth bank i've been to.
                    please?
          
                              carl
                    of course we can.    one moment
                    please.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
          
          carl gets up. he heads over to the soda machine and buys a
          diet coke. he then heads over to norman's desk.
          
                                 carl (cont'd)
                    diet coke?
          
                              norman
                    oooh, thank you. feed the
                    addiction, am i right?
          
          they clink diet cokes. norman downs his entire diet coke in
          one swallow. carl then heads over to the photocopier. he
          watches norman out of the corner of his eye. after a couple
          minutes, norman gets up and heads into the bathroom. carl
          heads back over to norman's desk and swipes the loan approval
          stamp.
          
          angle on the loan desk
          
          carl returns to the loan desk and stamps her form.
          
                              carl
                    it's approved.
          
          the bank customer hugs carl.
          
                              bank customer
                    thank you so much! i promise i
                    won't let you down, mr. kendall.
                    on me.
          
          the bank customer hands carl a panda beanie baby.
          
                              carl
                    thanks, marge. we don't like to
                    make other customers jealous so can
                    we keep this between you and i?
          
                                 bank customer
                    of course.     aren't you just a dear?
          
          the bank customer leaves.    carl can't help but be touched.
