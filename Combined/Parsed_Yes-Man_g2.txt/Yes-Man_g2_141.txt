          int. carl's apartment
          
          carl gets home.   he hits play on his answering machine.
          
                                                                  124.
          
          
          
                              peter (v.o.)
                        (over the answering
                         machine)
                    hey, carl. peter here. long time
                    no see. sorry to hear you won't be
                    planning our engagement party.
                    although i guess that makes you
                    less gay than i thought you were.
                    we'll be watching the game at
                    rudy's tonight, if you're
                    interested.
          
          carl deletes the message. he flips on survivor and starts to
          absentmindedly sort through his mail. he throws away
          junkmail until he gets to a postcard that catches his eye.
          he reads the postcard.

                    dear carl. i know this is kind of
                    random, but i thought i should
                    write you. we met at that party at
                    norman's apartment. i was the ins
                    guy who hated his life and hated
                    you. i just wanted to tell you
                    that i took your advice. i quit my
                    job and have founded a home in
                    botswana for elderly orangutans.
                    i've never been happier. you told
                    me to say "yes" and it has turned
                    out to be incredible. thank you.
                    yours truly, jason newmark
          
          carl turns over the post card.   on the cover of the card is a
          picture an orangutan.
