          int. stationery store - later
          
          lucy and carl are looking over a book of stationery with the
          stationery proprietess. carl can't concentrate.
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    this one is nice. i especially
                    love it in cream.
          
                              lucy
                    ooooh, pretty. what do you think?
          
                              carl
                    looks good to me.
          
                              lucy
                        (sarcastic annoyance)
                    thanks for your opinion.
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    it's always difficult to get the
                    husband-to-be's opinion.
          
                              lucy
                        (derisive laughter)
                    i'm not marrying him.
          
                              carl
                    i'm just helping throw the shower.
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    oh. what's the party going to be
                    like? sometimes it helps to know
                    that before you pick an invitation.
          
                              lucy
                    nothing special. just hors
                    d'oeuvres and wine.
          
          carl, meanwhile, is looking through the book of invitations.
          
                              carl
                    look at this -- bridal bingo.
                    what's bridal bingo?
          
                                                                  60.
          
          
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    it's bingo, except you yell out
                    embarrassing facts about the bride
                    and whoever fills their card first
                    wins.
          
                              carl
                    that sounds fun.
          
                              lucy
                    i'm not doing bridal bingo.
          
                              carl
                    how about a calendar shower?
          
                              lucy
                    can we concentrate at the task at
                    hand?
          
                              carl
                    do you even know what a calendar
                    shower is? maybe a calendar shower
                    is awesome.
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    every guest gets assigned a month
                    and brings a gift that the bride
                    and groom can use during that
                    month.
          
                              lucy
                    that's kind of cute.
          
                              carl
                    i think that's really cute.
          
          carl's starting to get really into it. he turns the page and
          sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled "knights in
          white armor."
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    look at this one -- "knights in
                    white armor."
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    the bride and groom ride in on a
                    white stallion.
          
                              carl
                    you have got to do that.   like it's
                    not even a choice.
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          
                              lucy
                    that seems a little extreme.
          
                              carl
                    you only get married once.
          
                              stationery proprietess
                    your friend happens to be right.
          
                              lucy
                    you're really good at this. you
                    mind helping me with the wedding
                    invitations?
