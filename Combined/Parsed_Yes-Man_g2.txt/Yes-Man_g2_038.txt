          int. norman's office
          
          carl nervously sits before norman.
          
                              norman
                    earlier today, you showed some
                    initiative. and i loved it. what
                    do you say to a permanent spot at
                    the loan desk?
          
                              carl
                    that seems like a lot of
                    responsibility.
          
                              norman
                    we need a loan specialist a lot
                    more than we need a teller and
                    greeter. besides, you'd have a
                    starting salary of 52.
          
                                 carl
                    grand?
          
                              norman
                    no, dollars. what is this darfur?
                        (waving to an african-
                         american employee)
                    sorry, patricia, that was
                    inappropriate.
                        (then, back to carl)
                    of course grand. to celebrate,
                    next saturday, i'm throwing a
                    party. dress up as your favorite
                    character from heroes.
                        (whispering)
                    save the cheerleader, save the
                    world.
          
                              carl
                    next saturday... sounds great.
          
                              norman
                    don't dress as hiro.    i got dibs.
          
                              carl
                    wouldn't think of it.
          
          carl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion.
          
                                                                    34.
