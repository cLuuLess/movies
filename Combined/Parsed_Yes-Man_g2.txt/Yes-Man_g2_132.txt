                              carl
                    i have a really important question.
                    i have to choose between traveling
                    around the world with a girl i'm
                    really into or choosing a job that
                    will make me pretty well off. i
                    don't know which yes to take.
          
                              sanji
                    how well off?
          
                              carl
                    i don't know why that's important.
          
                              sanji

                    a lot, ok?
          
                                                                   119.

                    this is    what i recommend. every
                    winter,    i throw a two week long
                    seminar    in aspen. it's only ten
                    grand a    week and it will open your
                    mind up    --
          
                              carl
                    i don't want to go to a seminar. i
                    just need help with this question.
          
                              sanji
                    for you, eight grand a week. i
                    have helped celebrities like cher
                    and jack welch. you will love it --
          
                              carl
                        (realizing)
                    you're a total con artist.
          
                              sanji
                    i am not a con artist. have i not
                    set you on the life path you
                    desire?
          
                              carl
                        (panicking)
                    i've put my life into the hands of
                    a con artist! and because of you i
                    have this retarded yes branded on
                    my hand for life!
                        (yelling to the
                         restaurant)
                    this man is a con artist! don't
                    listen to this man! he is a con
                    artist!
          
          carl runs out of the restaurant.
