          carl is sitting across from peter.
          
                              peter
                    for a whole year?
          
                              carl
                    yesterday i got promoted and beat
                    up and hooked up with this chick
                    and i have a massive headache today
                    and i still might throw up, but i
                    don't care because it was the best
                    time i've had in like forever. not
                    to mention finding out that,
                    despite what you might think,
                    smoked whitefish in an omelette is
                    delicious, even if covered in a
                    thick layer of pepper.
          
                              peter
                    but for a whole year?
          
                                carl
                    you don't   understand. i got
                    promoted.    do you know how long
                    i've been   waiting for some kind of
                    financial   step forward? i said
                    `yes' and   it arrived.
          
                              peter
                    well, someone sounds like they're
                    yuppifying their life.
          
                              carl
                    excuse me for wanting an appliance
                    in my kitchen besides a hot pot.
          
                                                         45.
          
          
          
                              peter
                    there's no way you can do this for
                    a whole year.
          
                              carl
                    that's where you come in.   you're
                    my "yesponsor."
          
                                 peter
                    yesponsor?
          
                              carl
                    like in aa. i need you to hold me
                    to it.
          
                              peter
                    you aren't going to last for more
                    than a week.
          
                              carl
                    i look forward to proving you
                    wrong.
          
          peter and carl shake hands.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    nice suit. if i move up anymore at
                    the bank, i might need a few.
          
                              peter
                    cavalli. silk and cotton blend.
                    seven fifty.
          
          lucy comes over and kisses peter.
          
                              lucy
                    my girlfriends are being such
                    bitches. it's been two weeks and
                    no one's offered to throw me a
                    wedding shower.
          
                              peter
                    that's too bad. i'm sure someone
                    will offer.
          
                              lucy
                        (sarcastic)
                    hey, you want to throw my wedding
                    shower?
          
          peter turns to carl, smiling.
          
                                                                     46.
          
          
          
                              carl
                        (dreading it)
                    i'd be happy to.
          
                              lucy
                    i was kidding. wedding showers are
                    thrown by girls.
          
                              carl
                    that's sexist. please.      i insist.
          
                                lucy
                    thanks.    that means a lot to me.
          
          lucy hugs carl. carl looks over lucy's shoulder at peter and
          shakes his head. rooney comes over.
          
                              rooney
                    that was some good times last
                    night. you back for more?
          
                                 carl
                    yes.
          
                              rooney
                    i've got no cash. you mind
                    spotting me and my buddies?
          
          rooney points to four barflies sitting at the bar.
          
                              peter
                    sorry, didn't bring my wallet.
          
          peter turns to carl.
          
                                 carl
                           (begrudgingly)
                    yes.
          
          carl walks up to the bar.     peter's snickering behind him.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    what kind of beer do you guys want?
          
                               rooney's friends/rooney
                    as long as you're buying, i want a
                    grey goose straight up./kir
                    royale/whatever's in that dusty
                    bottle back there that you never
                    take down.
          
                                                                    47.
