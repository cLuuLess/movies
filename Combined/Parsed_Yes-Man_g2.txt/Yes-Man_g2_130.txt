          int. peter's law office
          
          carl sits across from peter.
          
                              carl
                    i think i made a mistake letting
                    renee go like that. what if i'm
                    supposed to go on that trip?
          
                              peter
                    you own an apartment because of
                    that job. people don't generally
                    leave good jobs.
          
                              carl
                    but the bank doesn't feel right...
          
          peter's phone rings.   peter picks it up.
          
                              peter
                    hey, honey. i think we should go
                    with the tulips. i know roses are
                    more romantic, but they're also
                    much more clich√©d. babe, can you
                    wait a second?
                        (covering the phone)
                    i'm going to be on for a while.
                    ask your guru. he's the one who
                    sent you on this retarded quest in
                    the first place.
          
                                                                   118.
