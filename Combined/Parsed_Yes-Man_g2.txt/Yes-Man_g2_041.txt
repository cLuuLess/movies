          int. senor frog's - night
          
          rooney and carl are in a senor frogs.
          
                              carl
                    where's the class?
          
                              rooney
                    they wear uniforms here.
          
          a senor frog's waitress comes over.
          
                              senor frog's waitress
                    jello shot?
          
                              carl
                    yes.
          
          carl and rooney do jello shots.
          
          quick cuts:
          
          -- carl and rooney downing more jello shots.
          
          -- carl and rooney drinking beers.
          
          -- carl and rooney are drunkenly staring at a nearby group of
          girls.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    that girl is hot. or at least she
                    seems hot. i'm kind of too drunk
                    to tell. right now, honestly, you
                    seem hot.
          
                                                                       37.
          
          
          
                                rooney
                    i am hot.
          
                              senor frog's waitress
                    another jello shot?
          
          
          
                      carl                               rooney
          yes.                               i think i'm done.
          
          carl downs the jello shot.     he stumbles a little.
          
                              senor frog's dj
                    senor frog's famous karoake contest
                    is starting now! sign up and sweep
                    us off our feet!
          
                              rooney
                    you gotta do karoake.
          
          carl stumbles over to the senor frog's dj.     he's losing
          control and he likes it.
          
                              carl
                    sign me up, bitch.
          
                              senor frog's dj
                    we've got our first victim... i
                    mean, singer.
          
          music cue: the opening notes of white town's "your woman"
          
          carl grabs the microphone and heads out into the crowd.
          (note to reader: as you read this part, i recommend listening
          to white town's "your woman." it will bring it to life in a
          way that words on a page cannot do it justice.)
          
                               carl
                         (singing/talking with an
                          odd english accent)
                    just tell me what you've got to say
                    to me, i've been waiting for so
                    long to hear the truth, it comes as
                    no surprise at all you see, so cut
                    the crap and tell me that we're
                    through. now i know your heart, i
                    know your mind, you don't even know
                    you're being unkind, so much for
                    all your highbrow marxist ways,
                    just use me up and then you walk
                    away, boy you can't play me that
                    way.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
          carl heads over to the hot girl and begins serenading her.
          she thinks it's kind of funny.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    well i guess what you say is true,
                    i could never be the right kind of
                    girl for you, i could never be your
                    woman.
          
          carl gets really close to the hot girl's face and then coyly
          pulls away for the bridge of the song. during the awesome
          bridge, carl does some fantastic dance moves. or rather,
          moves that you think are fantastic when you're drunk out of
          your mind. the hot girl laughs at his antics.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    well i guess what they say is true,
                    i could never spend my life with a
                    man like you, i could never be your
                    woman. i could never be your
                    woman. i could never be your
                    woman.
          
          carl lands on one knee in front of the hot girl. the crowd
          cheers for him. the hot girl's large boyfriend gets up close
          to carl. everyone is very, very drunk.
          
                              brutish boyfriend
                    were you just flirting with my
                    girlfriend?
          
                              carl
                        (re: the hot girl)
                    it depends -- is that your
                    girlfriend?
          
                                brutish boyfriend
                    yes.
          
                                carl
                    then yes.
          
                              hot girl
                    hey, c'mon. be cool.    he was just
                    screwing around.
          
                              brutish boyfriend
                    let me handle this, crystal.
                        (to carl)
                    so, you want to have sex with my
                    girlfriend?
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
                                 carl
                    yes, i do.     very much.
          
                              brutish boyfriend
                    are you starting a fight?
          
                              rooney
                    c'mon, carl, let's go --
          
                                 carl
                    yes, i am.
          
                              brutish boyfriend
                    then bring it.
          
                                 carl
                    i will.
          
          beat. carl doesn't really know what to do so he slaps him
          across the face the way a woman would slap a man.
          
                              brutish boyfriend
                    what was that?
          
                              carl
                    me bringing it.
          
          the brutish boyfriend punches carl in the head.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    i'm too drunk to feel!  i'm like
                    darkman!
          
          carl headbutts the guy. they get into a dirty, drunken
          tussle. both of them are trying to hit the other one in the
          groin region. bouncers descend on them and pull them apart.
