          carl stands with the koreans. seung kim is speaking very
          rapidly at carl. carl has no idea what he's saying. seung
          kim laughs. carl laughs along with him. chris hits a
          beautiful shot. his ball lands almost on the green. the
          koreans notice and nervously chatter. chris approaches carl.
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
                              chris parker
                    alright, buddy. it's all you.
          
          carl grabs a nine iron from the golf bag.    everyone seems
          very impressed.
          
                              chris parker (cont'd)
                    you must have quite a powerful
                    stroke.
          
                              carl
                    i do.
          
                              seung kim
                        (in korean, to carl)
                    [good luck, my friend.]
          
                              carl
                        (in korean)
                    [i shall need the luck.    this is my
                    first time playing.]
          
          seung kim laughs.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                        (under his breath)
                    why does everyone think i'm joking?
          
          carl gingerly places the golf ball on the tee.    he looks
          towards the hole.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    that's really far.
          
          carl lines up his shot. he swings back, then forward, and
          plows the club into the grass, knocking the ball off the tee.
          the ball rolls down a slight incline resting just a couple
          feet from where carl hit it.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                        (in korean, to seung kim)
                    [you're up, seung kim.]
          
          carl walks back to where chris is at.
          
                              chris parker
                    what was that?
          
                              carl
                    just keeping them on their toes.
                    reverse psychology. tiger woods
                    does it.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
          
          seung kim raises his club back. he too dubs it, driving the
          club deep into the grass. his ball rolls just a couple feet
          past carl.
          
          golf montage wherein carl and seung kim compete to not be the
          absolute worst golf player ever
          
          -- carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees.
          
          -- seung kim, standing right in front of a pond, delicately
          taps his ball right into the pond.
          
          -- carl keeps divoting the grass. he divots so many times
          that he has to move the ball out of the hole's he's
          accidentally dug.
          
          -- seung kim hits his ball out of the sand trap. it rolls
          back in. he tries again. it rolls back in. he's about to
          try again when carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the
          lip of the sand trap. carl holds his finger up to his lips:
          "shhh."
          
          -- carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings.   he
          answers it.
          
                                carl (cont'd)
                      of course not.
          
          the other golfers look really impatient.
          
                                 carl (cont'd)
                      male.
                          (beat)
                      apartment.
                          (beat)
                      i prefer light beer.

                      orlando.
          
          carl holds up his finger.   only one moment.
          
          
          -- it's   getting late. now both carl and seung kim are
          hitting   their balls at once to save time. they are both
          running   and hacking at their balls across the fairway as if
          they're   playing a deranged game of field hockey.
