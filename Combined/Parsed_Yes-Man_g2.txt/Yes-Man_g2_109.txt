          ext. field - moments later
          
          carl and renee ride a tractor.   renee's taking photos as they
          bump over the field.
          
                              carl
                    this is awesome!
          
                              tractor driver
                    want me to open this sucker up?
          
                              carl/renee
                    yes!
          
          the driver turns up the speed.   they're suddenly going crazy
          fast.
          
                              tractor driver
                    take the wheel! feel the power of
                    john deere!
          
          carl takes the wheel. the tractor immediately gets away from
          him. they swerve straight and crash through the wall of an
          old barn. the driver kills the engine. renee, carl and the
          driver catch their breath.
          
                              carl
                    there's, uhh, no power steering.
          
                              tractor driver
                    it's a tractor, not a toyota.
          
                              carl
                    i'm sorry about the barn.
          
                                                                 106.
          
          
          
                                 tractor driver
                       been meaning to tear this sucker
                       down anyway.
