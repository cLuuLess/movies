          carl's in the middle of a heated discussion with chris.
          
                              carl
                    you can't close the maple branch!
          
                              chris parker
                    i know that maple's where you got
                    your start, but if i don't lay
                    those people off then i get laid
                    off. it's a vicious cycle.
          
                              carl
                    you don't have to if you don't want
                    to.
          
                              chris parker
                        (deadly serious)
                    if we don't close these branches
                    than kbi will buy our competitor
                    instead of us and put us all out of
                    business. if you want to be an
                    executive and get to do fun stuff
                    like your microloan project, then
                    you also have to be the bad guy who
                    lays people off. that's why we get
                    paid the big bucks. to make the
                    hard decisions.
