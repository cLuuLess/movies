          carl sits in his office.   lucy walks in.
          
                              carl
                    hey, luce. what're you doing all
                    the way over here?
          
                              lucy
                    it's been hard to reach you.
          
                              carl
                    i've been a little swamped.
          
                              lucy
                    everything ok?
          
                               carl
                    yeah.   things are great.
          
                              lucy
                    i was wondering when you want to
                    meet with the florist.
          
                              carl
                    sorry, but i'm too busy these days.
                    don't have time to help with the
                    party anymore. good luck.
          
                              lucy
                    you're just stopping, just like
                    that?
          
                              carl
                    i'm not the one marrying you.
                    maybe you should ask him for some
                    help.
          
                              lucy
                    he is helping. here i was thinking
                    we were actual friends.
          
          lucy leaves, upset.   carl doesn't move.
