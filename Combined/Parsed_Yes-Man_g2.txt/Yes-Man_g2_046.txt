          int. holiday inn hallway
          
          carl walks down the hallway. he knocks on room 125. after a
          couple minutes of shuffling around, sanji opens the door.
          
                                carl
                    i'm carl.    the guy from yesterday.
          
                              sanji
                    of course, of course!      please come
                    in!
          
          carl comes into sanji's hotel room.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    would you like a cup of coffee?
          
                              carl
                    no thanks. i just wanted to thank
                    you for that inspiration.
          
                              sanji
                    fantastic. so how do you plan on
                    continuing with your journey?
          
                              carl
                    you know, just living every day to
                    it's fullest. and, like, learning
                    to continue to experience life or
                    whatever.
          
                              sanji
                    outstanding, carl. except for one
                    thing:
                        (suddenly intense)
                    you are completely bullshitting me!
          
                                                          42.
          
          
          
                              carl
                    i just said i'm going to keep
                    experiencing life. i thought you'd
                    be happy.
          
                              sanji
                    you're like a cigarette addict,
                    carl. except you're addicted to
                    boredom. on the way in here, carl,
                    i offered you a coffee and you
                    refused. perhaps that would have
                    been the most delicious cup of
                    coffee you would have ever had.
                    who's to say? not you, carl,
                    because you said no! anyone can
                    quit smoking for a day. but for a
                    lifetime? no.
          
                              carl
                    so what should i do?
          
          sanji pulls out a contract.
          
                              sanji
                    behold, carl, -- the maniyesto.
          
          carl takes the maniyesto.
          
                              carl
                        (reading the document)
                    1) until new year's eve, i must say
                    yes. 2) the yes cannot distort the
                    truth.
          
                              sanji
                        (explaining)
                    you cannot say "yes, the world is
                    flat" because that is an untruth.
          
                              carl
                        (reading the document)
                    3) if someone discovers you are a
                    yes man, you do not have to say yes
                    to them. 4) to avoid yes, you
                    cannot avoid contact. therefore,
                    you must always answer your phone,
                    the door, your postal mail, your
                    email, etc and so on and so forth.
                    5) you must choose a yesponsor to
                    keep you on the straight and
                    narrow.
                        (to sanji)
                    who should that be?
          
                                                          43.
          
          
          
                              sanji
                    a close friend who will not tell a
                    soul.
          
                              carl
                        (reading the document)
                    5) i hereby void the "do you want"
                    loophole.
                        (to sanji)
                    what is that?
          
                               sanji
                    if someone asks you "do you want to
                    go to the art museum" and you do
                    not want to, you may not use this
                    lack of desire as an excuse to not
                    go. and finally, a warning.
                        (spookily)
                    if you say `no', even once, even
                    for a cup of coffee, be prepared to
                    lose every single little thing
                    you've gained.
                        (then)
                    so what do you say, carl?
                        (whispering)
                    what do you say?
          
                              carl
                    i say... yes.
          
          carl signs the maniyesto.
          
                                sanji
                    and here.
          
          carl signs again.
          
                                sanji (cont'd)
                    and here.
          
          carl signs again.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
                    and initial here. and here.
          
                              carl
                    is this like a legal document?
          
                              sanji
                    kind of. and finally, my friend,
                    please hold out your hand.
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
          
          carl holds out his hand. sanji pulls out an iron brand
          that's been heating over a hot pot and brands carl's palm.
          
                                 carl
                    ahhhhhhhh!
          
                              sanji
                    that should heal by new year's.
                    until then, you are a yes man.
          
          carl looks at his palm.       in the center of the palm, sanji's
          branded a `yes.'
