                    it can't be that bad.
          
                              jason
                    the other day, i turned down a guy
                    who had literally been a professor
                    at the university of cuba.

                              jason
                    you're probably right.
          
                              cuban professor
                    do you know the location of the
                    spanish-american war?

                               cuban professor

                               carl
                     so did you let him in?

                     i sent him back to cuba.       i send
                     them all back.
          
                               carl
                     if you hate your job so much, why
                     do you do it?
          
                               jason
                     because i have to eat.
          
                               carl
                         (to himself, in wonder)
                     you're a no man.
          
                                  jason
                     excuse me?
          
          beat.   carl makes a difficult decision.
          
                               carl
                         (whispering)
                     i'm not supposed to tell anyone
                     this except for my yesponsor, but
                     you can change your life. i've
                     changed mine. if i tell you how,
                     will you promise not to tell

                        (sarcastically whispering
                         back)
                    yeah, sure, whatever.
          
                              carl
                    i say yes. to everything.    say yes
                    more. it's that simple.
          
          dramatic beat.   jason finishes his drink.
          
                              jason
                    that's the most retarded idea i've
                    ever heard.
          
          jason heads off.   renee returns.
          
                              renee
                    what did i miss?
          
                              carl
                        (thrown)
                    nothing. do you want to go?
