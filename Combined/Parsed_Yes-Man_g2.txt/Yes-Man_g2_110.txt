          ext. antelope park and sunken gardens
          
          carl and renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park.
          
                                 renee
                       i think i might have whiplash from
                       that tractor ride.
          
                                 carl
                       just don't sue me.
          
                                 renee
                       watch your back, carl.   i mean it.
                       i'm very litigious.
          
                                 carl
                       this day has been so randomly
                       incredible.
          
                                  renee
                       would you... want to... travel
                       around the world with me?
                           (then)
                       i mean, i know we haven't really
                       been seeing each other for that
                       long, but i don't know...
          
                                 carl
                       yes.
          
                                 renee
                       yes?
          
                                 carl
                       definitely.
          
                                 renee
                       i think i'm falling, you know...
                       are you... ?
          
                                 carl
                       yes.

                                 renee
                       before our flight, what do you say
                       we grab a couple nebraskan steaks?
          
                                                                    107.
