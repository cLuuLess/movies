          int. romantic restaurant - later
          
          seb, carl and kath are sitting at dinner. it is incredibly
          awkward. kath and seb are clearly incredibly pissed off.
          
                              carl
                    so, how did you guys meet?
          
                              kath
                    i told you. through the firm.
          
          a waiter arrives.
          
                              waiter
                    would you like to order some wine?
          
                              kath/carl/seb
                    yes.
          
          cut to later -- carl, kath and seb are now slightly drunk.
          however, it is a quiet, angry drunk, not a fun-loving drunk.
          they are still sitting in silence. seb turns to kath and
          starts saying something quietly to her.
          
                              carl
                    oh, this is good.
                        (chuckling)
                    i was walking past pizza hut the
                    other day, and for a second i was
                    sure the sign said "pizza hat."
                    and then i thought, wouldn't it be
                    funny if there was a shop that sold
                    hats shaped like pizzas?
                        (beat, weakly)
                    you know. because it sounds like
                    "pizza hut" only it's a hat shop.
          
                              seb
                    look, carl, why don't you just eat
                    your fish and fuck off?
          
          carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the
          table and walks out of the restaurant. as he leaves, he
          smiles to himself. his phone rings. he sees it's rooney on
          the caller id.
          
                              carl
                    shit.
          
          carl answers the phone.
          
                                                                    56.
          
          
          
                              rooney (o.s.)
                    what's up carl? it's rooney!      what
                    do you say we grab a couple
                    brewskis?
