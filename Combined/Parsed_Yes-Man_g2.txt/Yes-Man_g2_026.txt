          int. carl's apartment - morning
          
          carl's asleep. the phone starts ringing.     carl sleepily
          grabs the phone.
          
                                                                       20.
          
          
          
                                 carl
                    yello.
          
                              peter (v.o.)
                        (on the phone)
                    carl, it's peter. i just wanted to
                    apologize about barging in
                    yesterday. you were right. it's
                    your life to live.
          
                              carl
                    don't worry about it.
          
                              peter (v.o.)
                        (on the phone)
                    me, lucy and kath are all going out
                    for brunch. you have any interest
                    in joining?
          
                              carl
                    oh, thanks for the invite, but...
          
          flash of sanji looming large in carl's eyes.
          
                               sanji
                    will you do it for me carl?       just
                    for a day?
          
          back to carl and peter.       we close in on carl's mouth.
          
                                 carl
                           (in slo-mo)
                    yes.
          
                                 peter
                    excuse me?
          
                              carl
                        (clearly not wanting to)
                    yes. i will come to brunch.
