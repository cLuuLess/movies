          carl's sitting across from a large man. carl's hands are
          like claws. a line of people waits to speak with him.
          
                              carl
                    how much does a schwinn cost?
          
                              large man
                    three hundred fifty three dollars.
                    it'll really help me get my one
                    hour delivery business off the
                    ground. i've tried on foot. i
                    only have a two mile radius.
          
                              carl
                    done and done.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          
          carl stamps the package.      norman comes over to the loan desk.
          
                              norman
                    hey, the boys upstairs are here to
                    speak with you.
          
                               carl
                    really?   because i have a thing at
                    one...
          
                              norman
                    he asked for you specifically.
                    ixnay on the small loans-ay.
          
          carl looks over. he sees the president (from the beginning
          of the movie) sitting in the conference room. carl gets
          nervous.
