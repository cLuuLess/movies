          int. jail - outside the interrogation room
          
          the two cops discuss carl. we see carl freaking out through
          the one-way mirror behind them as they talk.
          
                                 good cop bob
                       he's a moron. but i think he's
                       telling the truth.
          
                                 bad cop bob
                       i agree. no one ever admits to the
                       cheating question.
