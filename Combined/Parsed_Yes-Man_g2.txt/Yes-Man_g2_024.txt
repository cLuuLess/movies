          int. holiday inn conference room
          
          a banner across a stage that has a photo of the same indian
          man smiling beatifically. we pan down to find carl among the
          crowd. carl sits down next to a wiry, crunchy woman.
          
                              wiry, crunchy woman
                    is this your first time at one of
                    sanji's lectures?
          
                               carl
                        (scoffing)
                    uh, yeah.
                        (then)
                    have you been to this before?
          
                              wiry, crunchy woman
                    only like fifty-eight times.
                    sanji's a genius. like
                    seriously... he will blow your mind
                    all over the goddamn room. he's
                    like a mind grenade.
          
                              carl
                    i don't know if i want that.
          
                              wiry, crunchy woman
                    oh you do not. but you need it.
                    and that's why you are here.
          
                              carl
                    cool. do you want anything from
                    the refreshment area?
          
                                                                      16.
          
          
          
                              wiry, crunchy woman
                    you kidding? that processed shit
                    will kill you faster than a
                    pleasure cruise to chernobyl.
          
          carl heads over to the refreshment table. once he's out of
          her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference
          room. ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers.
          people begin to sit. carl sits down in the back.
          
                               sanji (v.o.)
                    life.   we are all living it.
          
          carl laughs.   no one else does.   the lights get rosier.
          
                              sanji (v.o.) (cont'd)
                    or are we? change doesn't start on
                    the surface. it's generated from
                    consciousness. but where is
                    consciousness generated from?
          
          carl looks around.   everyone is nodding along with it.
          
                              sanji (cont'd)
