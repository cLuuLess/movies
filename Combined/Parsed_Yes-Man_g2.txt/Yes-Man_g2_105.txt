          int. plane
          
          renee and carl have the aisle and window on the plane.   a
          young woman comes up to carl.
          
                                 young woman
                       hi, there. would you mind
                       switching places with me? i want
                       to be across the aisle from my mom.
          
          her mom is indeed across from carl.
          
                                 renee
                       we're actually flying together.
          
                                 young woman
                       it would really mean a great deal.
                       she's very scared of flying.
          
                                 carl
                       where's your seat?
          
          the young woman points at her seat. it's a couple rows up in
          the middle. her middle seat's bookended by a mom with a
          screaming baby and an enormous man.
          
                                 carl (cont'd)
                       this is an aisle. that's a middle.
          
          renee looks at carl like, why won't you just refuse?
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          
                              mom
                    i'm really scared of flying.
          
          cut to moments later
          
          carl between the crying baby and the enormous man. renee
          turns and waves to him from a couple rows up. carl puts on a
          saccharin smile and waves back.
