          ext. rudy's - night
          
          it's new year's eve at rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive.
          people stream into the bar to celebrate. outside, carl
          kendall (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend kath are
          having a quiet intense discussion.
          
                              kath
                    you don't do anything more. you
                    used to be fun. now you hardly
                    ever even leave your apartment.
          
                              carl
                    i'm here, aren't i?
          
                              kath
                    that's because it's new year's eve.
                    you have to be here. besides, it's
                    not only social stuff. you used to
                    have dreams. you wanted to go to
                    business school, you wanted to work
                    for the world bank.
          
                              carl
                    so i discovered b-school's not for
                    me. people grow.
          
                              kath
                    growing is "x is not for me so i'll
                    do y." you went x is not for me
                    and so i guess i'll sit on the
                    couch for the rest of my life.
          
                              carl
                        (acquiescing)
                    well, look, this sucks, but i
                    understand where you're coming
                    from.
          
                              kath
                    this is the problem. you don't
                    even care that i'm breaking up with
                    you.
          
                              carl
                    of course i care.   but i also
                    understand.
          
                              kath
                    you shouldn't just understand. you
                    should be mad. or upset. or sad.
                    or something.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
                              carl
                    we're at different places in our
                    lives. i get it.
          
                              kath
                    your girlfriend of two years breaks
                    up with you right before new year's
                    eve and all you can say is "i get
                    it?" it is completely within your
                    right to call me a bitch.
          
                              carl
                    that would be inappropriate.
          
                              kath
                        (tearing up)
                    i can't believe i've been dating
                    someone so emotionless.
          
                               carl
                    c'mere.   it'll be ok.
          
          carl hugs her.
