          ext. southwest bank corporate offices
          
          southwest bank employees and carl stand in a picket line
          outside the corporate offices.
          
                              employees
                    hell no! we won't go!    hell no!
                    we won't go!
          
          chris gets out of his car and heads to the office. carl
          hides his face from chris so that chris won't recognize him.
          
                              rooney
                    throw a rock at him.
          
                              norman
                    yeah, throw a rock!
          
          carl grabs a rock and very delicately lobs it in chris's
          direction. he then takes off running in the opposite
          direction. he then circles around and runs into the back
          entrance of the bank.
