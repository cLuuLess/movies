          int. korean restaurant - later
          
          carl's eating across from renee. he can't stand the food.
          he grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down.
          
                              renee
                    do you want any more squid hot pot?
                    it's really good here.
          
                              carl
                    i think i'm good.   to have some
                    more.
          
          renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    so, all this art you create.   what
                    do you want to do with it?
          
                              renee
                    what do you mean?
          
                              carl
                    like, do you want to open a store?
          
                              renee
                    where i can sell my photos and
                    pottery? of course not. they're
                    terrible.
          
          carl's surprised that she knows this.
          
                              carl
                    they're not terrible.
          
                              renee
                    yeah, they're awful.
          
                              carl
                    i think you're being hard on
                    yourself --
          
                              renee
                    i'm not asking for sympathy. my
                    voice is way too high-pitched, my
                    pottery looks like poo, and my
                    photos are blurry and subjectless.
                    but who gives a shit? not
                    everything needs a goal. the world
                    is a playground. you know that as
                    a kid but then somewhere along the
                    way everyone forgets.
                              (more)
          
                                                 72.
          
                       renee (cont'd)
              (as if    telling a secret)
          besides, i    can't open a store. my
          big master    plan is to take a trip
          around the    world.
          
                     carl
          when?   like in a couple years?
          
                    renee
          i bought a ticket for four months
          from now.
          
                    carl
          people always talk about that, but
          you're actually doing it.
          
                     renee
          honestly, i'm terrified.
              (then)
          how about you? do you like the
          bank?
          
                    carl
          it's lame, but you know, it's
          pretty funny. my boss norman
          always throws theme parties.
          
                    renee
          so if it's lame why do you work
          there?
          
                    carl
          because... it's actually not lame.
              (realizing)
          i just gave the answer i've
          automatically given for years. i'm
          actually enjoying the bank for the
          first time maybe ever. i started
          this pilot program that gives out
          microloans.
          
                    renee
          what's that?
          
                    carl
          like say you need three hundred
          bucks to pay for paint so you can
          start a house painting business.
          rather than paying a loan shark who
          charges you 300%, now you can come
          to southwest bank. whatever. it's
          kind of dorky.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          
                              renee
                    that actually sounds really cool.
          
          the waitress comes over.
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                    i'm stuffed. but i would love to
                    wrap this up.
          
                              carl
                        (in korean, with
                         subtitles)
                    [we are very fat. but can i please
                    have this food made mobile?]
          
                              renee
                    so, what do you say we hit this
                    crazy party?
          
                              carl
                    funny, not crazy.    my boss is white
                    noise.
          
                              renee
                    white noise?
          
                              carl
                    you know, like totally boring.
          
                              renee
                    i don't know anyone who's totally
                    boring. crack a person's shell --
                    there's always something creepy
                    underneath.
