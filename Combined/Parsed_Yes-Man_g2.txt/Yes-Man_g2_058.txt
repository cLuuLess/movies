          ext. street
          
          carl walks down the street, now holding a zillion fliers.
          carl gets a tap on the shoulder. reveal kath standing there.
          
                              kath (o.s.)
                    thinking of learning a couple
                    foreign languages?
          
                              carl
                    hey, kath. would you like one?
                    i'm going to learn swahili.
          
                              kath
                    maybe next week. there's someone
                    you should probably meet. carl,
                    this is seb.
          
          a very tall, very blond, nordic looking man approaches carl.
          
                                carl
                    seb?    what is that?   swedish?
          
                                seb
                    yes.
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
          beat. seb puts his hand on kath's back.   carl notices this
          and is not particularly happy.
          
                              seb (cont'd)
                    i've heard a lot about you, carl.
          
          seb's phone rings.
          
                              seb (cont'd)
                    sorry, sweetie. i've got to take
                    this.
          
          seb walks off and answers his cell.
          
                              carl
                    you're on a date then?
          
                               kath
                    yeah.   met him at my firm.
          
                              carl
                    he's very tall.
          
                              kath
                    i guess so, yeah.
          
          seb returns.
          
                              carl
                    well, it was nice meeting you, seb.
                    so i'll be going.
          
          carl starts to walk off.
          
                              seb
                    unless... you'd like to join us?
          
          carl stops in his tracks. he mouths the word "fuck." carl
          turns. kath nods at carl as in, "you don't have to join us."
          
                              seb (cont'd)
                    it was good meeting you --
          
                              carl
                    i'd love to. join you guys.
          
                               kath
                    what?
          
                                                                  55.
