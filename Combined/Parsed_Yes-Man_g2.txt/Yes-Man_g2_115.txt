          int. jail - interrogation room
          
          carl's sitting across from two dea agents, good cop bob and
          bad cop bob.
          
                                 good cop bob
                    i'm bob.
          
                              bad cop bob
                    and i'm bob.
          
          carl can't help but laugh.
          
                              bad cop bob (cont'd)
                    do you find that funny?
          
          carl sees his hand with "yes" on it.
          
                             carl
                    yes. i'm sorry. just let the girl
                    go. she doesn't know anything.
          
                              bad cop bob
                    we'll see about that, carl.
          
                              carl
                    some old lady gave me a package in
                    the lincoln airport to deliver to
                    her son, sheldon winkleton. that
                    was really stupid of me and i
                    realize that now. i don't know
                    anything about anything.
          
                              good cop bob
                    just answer a few questions and i'm
                    sure we'll get this all sorted out.
                    have you ever used illegal drugs?
          
          carl stares at them.    he should probably lie...
          
                                 carl
                    yes.
          
                                 good cop bob
                    pot?
          
                               carl
                    yes.   but that's all.
          
                              bad cop bob
                    how about shrooms?
          
                                                                   110.
          
          
          
          carl nods.
          
                                 carl
                       but that's the only bad shit i've
                       done. i swear.
          
                                 bad cop bob
                       never cheated on a girlfriend?
          
                                 carl
                           (weeping)
                       yes, i have. but i was in high
                       school. i was a mess. she had
                       cheated on me --
          
          the bad cop slams his fist down on the table.
          
                                 bad cop bob
                       you disgust me.
          
          the good cop restrains the bad cop.
