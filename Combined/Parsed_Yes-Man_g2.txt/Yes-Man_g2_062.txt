          ext. park - pre-dawn
          
          renee, along with several other amateur photographers in
          sweat suits, have gathered. they all have big cameras around
          their necks. carl walks up to them. he does not look good.
          
                              carl
                    good morning.
          
                                                                  57.
          
          
          
                                 renee
                    wow.     you look tired.
          
                              carl
                    well, it is five in the morning.
          
                              renee
                    mammals are meant to be up at dawn.
                    it's how we're built biologically.
                    where's your camera?
          
          carl realizes he forgot his camera.
          
                              carl
                    i thought i'd use my phone.
          
          carl pulls out his camera cell phone.
          
                              renee
                    awesome idea. so light.
          
                              carl
                    that's what i thought.
          
                              renee
                    let's hit it.
          
          renee, carl and the group of amateur jogging photographers
          start jogging. carl can barely keep up with them.
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                    oooh, pretty.
          
          as she passes a flower, renee snaps a photo of it.
