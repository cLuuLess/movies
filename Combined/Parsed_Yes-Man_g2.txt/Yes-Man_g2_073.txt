          int. gallery
          
          carl walks around a photography gallery. renee's photos are
          up. they are terrible photos, since they were taken while
          she was jogging. their subjects are blurry. some of them
          are half in the photo and half out. the featured photo is of
          carl throwing up on the ground.
          
                                                                  70.
          
          
          
                              carl
                    you really are displaying that.
          
                              renee
                    that's probably my best photo ever.
                    my collages aren't bad. but
                    personally, i think i excel at
                    pottery.
          
          renee points to a large, brown plate that looks like poo.
          
                              carl
                    wow. that's really big. how do
                    you have time for all this stuff?
          
                              renee
                    how do you have time to come to
                    every one of my rocks shows even
                    the one in fairfield county that
                    was seventy-five miles from here?
                    i almost skipped that one.
          
                              carl
                    you gave me the flier, so i had to
                    go.
          
                              renee
                    at first i thought you were a weird
                    stalker and i was scared. but now
                    i think you're just a really shy
                    dude with a crush. and while it's
                    been suspenseful to see when/if
                    you'd ask me out --
          
                              carl
                    do you want to go out sometime?
          
                              renee
                    yes, i would.
          
                              carl
                    by the way, i do other stuff
                    besides follow you around.
          
                                 renee
                    like what?
          
                              carl
                    i take korean.
          
                              renee
                    in that case, what do you say we do
                    korean?
          
                                                                  71.
