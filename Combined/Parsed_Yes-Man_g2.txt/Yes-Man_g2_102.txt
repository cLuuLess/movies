          int. pottery studio
          
          carl walks into the pottery studio, looking guilty.   renee is
          making a giant piece of pottery.
          
                              renee
                    what's up, chicken butt?
                        (off his guilty look)
                              (more)
          
                                                                 100.
          
                              renee (cont'd)
                    are you ok? did everything go ok
                    at golf?
          
          carl considers whether he should say anything about the kiss.
          
                              carl
                    i just got promoted to bank
                    manager.

                    congratulations!
          
          renee kisses carl.
          
                              renee (cont'd)

                    pottery. like you can rub the clay
                    all over me.

                    ok.
          
          carl goes to grab some clay.
          
                              renee
                    i was kidding. not as sexy as it
                    seems. it gets in like everywhere.
                        (awkward beat)

                              carl
                    have dinner?

                              carl
                        (nervously)
                    no, we just had american food,
                    american fare.
          
                              renee
                    you've just been so busy -- it'd be
                    fun to have a night just the two of
                    us. i wish we could just go to the
                    airport and hop on the first flight
                    outta here.
          
          carl's eyes light up.
          
                               carl
                    yes.
          
                                                                 101.
