          int. carl's apartment
          
          carl walks into his apartment.    he hits play on his answering
          machine.
          
                              peter (v.o.)
                        (over the answering
                         machine)
                    carl, it's peter. i know you don't
                    do things anymore, but it'd mean a
                    lot if you'd come by rudy's
                    tonight. lucy and i are
                    celebrating our engagement.
