          carl sits at his cubicle, and flips on his email. in the
          background, we see various super happy employees eating the
          dunkin donuts that carl has brought. we see on the screen
          another email from the king of nigeria.
          
                              carl
                    dear deposed king of nigeria. i

                    with your confidential transaction.

                    yours, carl kendall.
          
          he checks the next email.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    would i like viagra? yes, i would.
          
          carl writes back to the viagra. angle on the screen: the
          next email is from persianwifefinder.com.
          
                              carl (cont'd) (cont'd)
                    do i want a persian wife? perhaps
                    i do.
          
          carl clicks onto the persianwifefinder.com and starts
          uploading his profile. norman walks by.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    norman, would you say i prefer
                    iranian, pakistani, bangladeshi or
                    no preference?
