          ext. street
          
          carl walks out of dunkin donuts, carrying a frozen coffee
          drink and several boxes of munchkins. he walks by renee and
          wordlessly takes a flier.
          
                              renee
                    hey, give that back.    you already
                    took one.
          
                              carl
                    what's the hurt in taking another?
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
          
                              renee
                    destroys the earth. also, they
                    cost me ten cents a copy. besides,
                    are you even going to come?
          
                                 carl
                    of course.     i couldn't say `no.'
          
          as he walks away...
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    even if i wanted to.
          
                              renee
                    see you tonight, carl!
