          lucy and carl wander around a fancy bakery.
          
                              lucy
                    i've never heard of a wedding
                    shower cake.
          
                              carl

                    calls them a necessity.
          
          carl's phone rings.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    sorry, luce. work stuff.

                    blood bank in twenty minutes.
          
          carl hangs up.   lucy suddenly starts crying.
          
                              carl (cont'd)
