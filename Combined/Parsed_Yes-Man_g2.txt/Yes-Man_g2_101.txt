          carl's shaking hands with the korean bank representatives.
          chris shakes carl's hand.
          
                              chris parker
                    i'm promoting you to bank manager.
                        (pulling carl close)
                    i've got my eye on you, boy. don't
                    you forget it.
          
          chris laughs. carl nervously laughs along with him. the
          pretty korean banker walks by and waves at him. carl waves
          back. he looks very guilty.
