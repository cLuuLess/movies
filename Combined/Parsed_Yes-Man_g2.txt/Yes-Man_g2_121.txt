                              chris parker
                    so i got a call from the police
                    department.
          
                              carl

                              chris parker
                    i spent a couple years in prison
                    myself. so i backdated some stock
                    options. excuse me for trying to
                    help our bottom line, right?
          
                              carl
                    you got to do what you got to do to
                    help mr. and mrs. shareholder.
          
                              chris parker
                    we are their slaves.

                              chris parker
                    honestly, i prefer for all my top
                    guys to have been in the big house.
                    we've all eaten the slop. there's
                    a trust there you can't break.
          
          chris holds out his hand.
          
                              chris parker (cont'd)
                    so, what do you say to being a vp
                    and expanding your microloan
                    program bankwide?
          
                                 carl
                           (surprised)
                    yes.
          
          carl shakes chris's hand.
          
                                                                   114.
