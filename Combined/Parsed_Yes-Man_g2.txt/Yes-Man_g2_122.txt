          carl's office has views of other corporate parks. despite
          the fancy digs, carl's depressed. chris pokes his head in.
          carl's on the phone.
          
                              carl
                        (on the phone)
                    that's right, we're dropping the
                    minimum loan to one dollar, bank-
                    wide.
          
                              chris parker
                    could you look through these
                    numbers and let me know which of
                    our five branches have been lagging
                    behind in profit?

                    the microloan program.
