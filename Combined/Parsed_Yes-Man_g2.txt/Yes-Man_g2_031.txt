          int. stackers - later
          
          all of carl's food is covered piles of pepper.
          
                              peter
                    i don't think i've ever seen a
                    waiter tap one of those pepper
                    mills.
          
                               carl
                    i'm just addicted to the stuff.
                    chinese cultures say it's good for
                    digestion.
                        (then)
                    you're all welcome to have some.
          
                              lucy
                    that's... ok. do you want a bite
                    of mine?
          
                                 carl
                           (begrudgingly)
                    yes.
          
          carl takes a bite of lucy's.      he then sips his coffee.
          
                                                                  27.
          
          
          
                              carl (cont'd)
                    uch. brunch coffee. why can't
                    they make it black without all this
                    frothy shit?
          
                              peter
                    because you ordered a latte.
          
          carl's phone rings.   he answers it.
          
                              norman (o.s.)
                    hey, carl. we're a little short on
                    our saturday staff. i know this is
                    going against ten years of
                    precedent, but you have any
                    interest in coming in today?
          
                              carl
                    i don't think... there's any reason
                    why i shouldn't? on a saturday
                    there's nothing i like more than
                    the inside of a bank.
          
                              norman (o.s.)
                    there really is something magical
                    about this place.
