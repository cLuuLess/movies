          int. southwest bank - conference room
          
          carl walks into the conference room.     the bank president,
          chris parker, motions to a seat.
          
                              chris parker
                    carl kendall? i'm chris parker.
                    president of southwest bank.
          
                              carl
                    i actually met you when i was just
                    a teller.
          
                               chris parker
                        (no recollection of it at
                         all)
                    of course!
                        (reading from a binder)
                    pet-a-puppy day. free cookie day.
                    free half hour on the bank's
                    punching bag day. you've upped
                    walk-in traffic by 35%. not only
                    that -- you've also taken charge of
                    corporate day care. i like a team
                    player.
          
          carl's phone buzzes.    the caller id says lucy.
          
                                 carl
                    thank you.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
                              chris parker
                    but then i got suspicious. what
                    drives a man in his mid to late
                    thirties who's still at the
                    absolute lowest level of our
                    corporate family? generous
                    helpfulness? or raging revenge?
          
                              carl
                    generous helpfulness?
          
                              chris parker
                    which is when i got the numbers
                    from your loan desk.
          
          carl turns white. carl's phone buzzes again.    the text says
          lucy: "where are you?"
          
                               carl
                    uh huh.
          
                              chris parker
                    you've given out over 682 below
                    minimum loans. one of them was
                    literally for fifteen dollars and
                    eighty seven cents.
          
                              carl
                    janice peabody's ant farm rental
                    business.
          
                              chris parker
                    how do you explain yourself?
          
                              carl
                    i've started a microloan project.
                    i figure that if someone needs less
                    than ten grand why should they go
                    to a loan shark when they can come
                    to a legitimate banking
                    institution?
          
                              chris parker
                    because the paperwork makes any
                    profit moot. unless you're raiding
                    our coffers.
          
                               carl
                    no.   i wouldn't do that.
          
                              chris parker
                    i would if i could, so why wouldn't
                    you?
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          chris laughs. carl laughs. chris abruptly stops laughing.
          so does carl. carl's phone buzzes again. the text says
          lucy: "i thought we were meeting at one. please call back."
          
                              chris parker (cont'd)
                    but then i looked closer at the
                    numbers. 85% of the loan
                    recipients have been paying them
                    off according to the bank's
                    schedule. not just that, but 72%
                    of that group have returned as
                    regular full loan customers. this
                    is both a moneymaker and good for
                    the community. that like never
                    happens!
          
                                 carl
                    thank you.
          
                              chris parker
                    you're the kind of person we want in
                    corporate. we're taking some clients
                    on a golfing trip. you golf?
          
                                 carl
                    yes.
          
                              chris parker
                    you free tomorrow?
          
                                 carl
                    yes.
          
                              chris parker
                    of course you are. i better watch
                    my back around you, carl kendall.
                    soon you'll be taking my job. see
                    you on the links.
          
          chris parker grabs carl's hand and shakes it.   carl runs out
          of the office.
