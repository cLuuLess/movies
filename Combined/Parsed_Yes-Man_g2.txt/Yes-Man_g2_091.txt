          int. fancy restaurant - night
          
          renee, carl, kath, seb, peter and lucy sit around a table at
          a nice restaurant. as per usual, carl has several different
          meals in front of him. he also has a martini, a glass of
          water, and a glass of orange juice. carl's showing off to
          his friends. as he shows off, renee looks irritated.
          
                              carl
                        (showing off, to peter)

                    place. built in bose surround

                    you think? we went to three
                    different prada stores to find the
                    right fit.
          
                              lucy
                    what do yo do for a living, renee?

                    you should check out her pottery.
                    it's really big.
          
                                                                    89.

                              lucy
                    real estate broker.
          
                                 peter/kath/seb
                    lawyer.
          
          quiet beat.   the conversation's not exactly flowing easily.
          
                              peter
                    if you'll excuse me.
          
          peter leaves.   the waiter comes over.
          
                              waiter
                    have you made a decision about the
                    wine?
          
                              carl
                    well, we're kind of in a
                    celebratory mood.
          
                              waiter
                    in that case, may i suggest a 97
                    petit rothschild?
          
          the waiter points at a wine that costs $400 a bottle.
          
                              carl
                    maybe we should wait for peter to
                    decide.
          
                              lucy
                    he doesn't know crap about wine.
                    just pick one, carl.
          
          carl is sweating bullets.
          
                               carl
                    why not?   let's celebrate.
          
                              waiter
                    with six people, i'd recommend two
                    bottles.
