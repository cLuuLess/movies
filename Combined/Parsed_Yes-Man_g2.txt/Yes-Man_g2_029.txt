          carl and his friends are sitting at a table.    carl's slightly
          bored as his friends discuss real estate.

                    it's a two bedroom duplex with
                    harbor views. it'd be perfect for
                    you kath.
          
                              kath
                    washer/dryer in the building?
          
                              carl
                        (jealous)
                    i didn't realize you were looking
                    to buy a place. i thought you and i
                    would be renters to the end.

                        (playful)
                    shut up.
          
          the brunch dude is seated near carl. he gives him a thumbs
          up. carl gives a thumbs up right back.
          
                              peter
                        (re: the menus)

                    i don't want an adventure first
                    thing in the morning.
