          int. tony's apartment - day
          
          carl's sitting awkwardly on the floor across from tony.   they
          are both drinking tea.
          
                              tony
                    it is only through the four noble
                    truths and the destruction of
                    desire that we can end suffering.
          
                              carl
                    well, that's really neat.
                        (awkward beat)
                    so, thanks for the books and the
                    jasmine tea and the vegan curry,
                    but i have to go --
          
                              tony
                    do you like dionne warwick?
          
          tony flips on dionne warwick's "i say a little prayer."
          
                              tony (cont'd)
                    now she had style.
          
                              carl
                    it was really great meeting you --
          
                              tony
                    c'mon, carl. shake your groove
                    thang.
          
                                                                      67.
          
          
          
          tony pulls carl up.    carl starts to awkwardly shake his
          groove thing.
          
                              tony (cont'd)
                    i like big guys.
          
                              carl
                    i really have to go.
          
          tony grabs carl and kisses him full on the lips.
          
                              tony
                    want to go into my bedroom?
          
          close in on carl's face.      he looks down on the "yes" that's
          on his palm.
          
                                 carl
                           (very quiet)
                    yes.
          
          carl and tony head into his bedroom.
