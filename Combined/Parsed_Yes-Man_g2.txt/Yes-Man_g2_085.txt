                    he cares, he just doesn't know how
                    to show it.

                    him about how you're feeling it'll
                    be ok.
          
                              lucy
                    he can be just so closed off.

                    you've been so good to me. i've
                    really come to depend on you. i
                    want to pay you back.
          
                              carl
                    not necessary.
          
                              lucy
                    peter tells me you might have some
                    disposable income these days.
          
                              carl
                    for some reason, the bank keeps
                    promoting me.
          
                              lucy
                    if you want to look at some open
                    houses, i'm happy to waive my fee.
