          int. carl's apartment - later
          
          carl's watching hell's kitchen and eating a frozen pizza.
          there's a knock on the door. the "just say yes" pamphlet
          balled up on his desk. he's using it as a napkin. carl
          pauses the television show. he stands up and opens the door.
          peter stumbles in.
          
                              carl
                    what are you doing here?
          
                              peter
                    this is an intervention.    you've
                    missed your last event.
          
                              carl
                    what're you talking about?
          
                              peter
                    our engagement party.
          
                                 carl
                    i'm sorry.     i'm just really busy.
          
                                                13.
          
          
          
                    peter
          you're watching hell's kitchen.
          that's not even b-list reality tv.
          
                    carl
          so i don't want to go out tonight.
          maybe i have to wake up early
          tomorrow. you don't know.
          
                    peter
          it's bigger than that. you and
          kath broke up over a year ago and
          you still aren't dating anyone.
          
                    carl
          what? so? i'm like a sexual
          camel. i only need it once every
          couple years.
          
                    peter
          i don't mean to be harsh but
          everyone's moving forward. it's
          like you're still wearing a timex
          while the rest of us each have
          entry level rolexes.
          
                    carl
          you wear a rolex?
          
                    peter
          thanks for noticing. it's an
          oyster perpetual yachtmaster.
          sapphire crystal, self-winding.
          four gs. but that's not the point
          i'm trying to make.
          
                    carl
          so i don't have an oyster watch.
          all you and lucy and kath do is sit
          around and talk about real estate
          and crate and barrel.
          
                    peter
          what's wrong with crate and barrel?
          they have adorable stuff at
          reasonable prices.
          
                    carl
          forget crate and barrel. maybe i'm
          just getting more mature. i don't
          need the lifestyle ever night.
          
                                                 14.
          
          
          
                    peter
          lifestyle? you have to have a life
          to have a style of life. you never
          leave your apartment. you never
          meet anyone new.
          
                    carl
          i hate meeting people.
          
                    peter
          you've become a complete cave
          dweller.
          
                    carl
          i am not a cave dweller. just the
          other day, we all went to
          summerfest and snuck backstage and
          you bet me i wouldn't steal
          something and so i stole a
          drumstick from that horrible
          swedish hillbilly band. that's not
          very cave dweller of me.
          
                     peter
          just the other day?   that was seven
          years ago.
          
                    carl
          but that's not possible -- i was
          already working at the bank by
          then.
          
                    peter
          you had started there three years
          earlier. why you've worked at that
          place for so long is beyond me.
          you had so much potential. you
          shouldn't be a teller. you should
          be the guy who tells the guy who
          tells the teller what to do.
          
                    carl
              (shocked)
          i've been a teller at southwest
          bank for ten years? how the hell
          did that happen?
              (doing the math)
          ten years... if i had had a child,
          he'd be toilet-trained by now.
          
                    peter
          actually, he'd be in fourth grade.
          
                                                                   15.
          
          
          
                               carl
                        (starting to panic)
                    i was making out with chicks by
                    fourth grade. i was a little man
                    by fourth grade.
                        (then)
                    whatever. i don't need this shit
                    right now. i'm an adult man. i
                    can live my life as i see fit. can
                    you please leave?
          
          carl pushes peter out the door. carl sits down on the couch.
          he then unballs the "just say yes" pamphlet. it features an
          indian man smiling beatifically.
          
                                                        match cut to:
