          carl sits at his cubicle, flips on his email.
          
                              carl
                        (reading the email)
                    dear trusted foreigner, allow me to
                    introduce myself. i am the deposed
                    king of nigeria and i wish to
                    propose a confidential transaction.
                        (to the computer)
                    allow me to delete you, my liege.
          
          norman, his needy boss, comes up to him.
          
                              norman
                    my teller reporting for duty.
          
                              carl
                    i'm not a soldier.
          
                               norman
                    you're a soldier on the front line
                    of finance.

                              norman (cont'd)

          carl looks at his calendar.   it's totally empty.
          
                              carl
                        (clearly lying)
                    i'm out of town.
