          norman sits across from carl.
          
                              norman
                    i know what you're doing.
          
                              carl
                    what am i doing?
          
                              norman
                    you're loaning below our minimum.
          
          carl doesn't know what to say.
          
                              norman (cont'd)
                    you thought i wouldn't notice the
                    paperwork? i'm not the regional
                    manager because i ignore the
                    details.
          
                              carl
                    i'm sorry, but it's absurd that if
                    you need a small amount of money
                    you have to go to a loan shark.
                    only rich people can pay back loans
                    over ten grand. a bank's job is
                    not to just help the rich. it's to
                    help anyone with a dream achieve
                    it.
          
                                                                  63.

                    i know. these microloans are
                    pretty interesting. so i'll you
                    spearhead a little pilot program at
                    the bank.
          
                              carl
                    thank you so much.
          
                              norman
                    if corporate finds out, you're the
                    one who's getting fired. so keep
                    it quiet.

          rooney sits down across from carl.
          
                              carl
                    what do you need a loan for?
          
                              rooney
                    i don't. i was wondering if you
                    were around tonight to help me
                    move?
          
                              carl
                    why don't you hire movers?
          
                              rooney
                    because it's cheaper to ask you.
