          carl walks in the door. peter, lucy and rooney, who's
          clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him.
          
                              rooney
                    carl kendall? out in the world?
                    are you some kind of ghost? am i
                    having a religious vision?
          
                              carl
                    believe it. because this guy just
                    got a promotion.
          
                              lucy
                    congrats, carl!
          
                              rooney
                    well let's get you a beer. you
                    want a 20 ouncer? i'm just joking -
                    -
          
                              carl
                    yes.
          
          rooney looks at peter and lucy.
          
                              peter
                    a normal-sized beer is fine with
                    me.
          
                              lucy
                    i think i'm done actually.
          
                              rooney
                    two twenty ouncers and one tiny,
                    little beer, barkeep.
          
                              bartender
                    please don't call me that.   we're
                    not in the middle ages.
          
                              rooney
                        (to carl)
                    i can't believe you're out here.
                    i'm giddy. i feel like a child
                    whose best friend has strict
                    chinese parents who never let him
                    come out and play but now his
                    chinese parents are away for the
                    chinese new year. you have any
                    interest in pounding this shit?
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                                carl
                    why not?
          
          rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty
          ouncer. carl reluctantly pounds it as well. rooney slams
          his on the table. carl puts it on the table.
          
                              rooney
                    what do you say we have another?
          
                                carl
                    yes.
          
                              rooney
                    you are a beast!
          
                              lucy
                    well, it's been fun watching you
                    guys recreate freshman year, but
                    peter and i have some furniture
                    errands to run.
          
          carl's a little drunk now.
          
                              carl
                    have a good day yuppifying your
                    lives.
          
                              peter
                    we need a sofa, carl.     we're not
                    buying a second home.
          
                              rooney
                    whatever, yuppy sellouts.
          
                              lucy
                    it was good seeing you.    you should
                    come out more often.
          
                               carl
                         (kind of pleading)
                    please don't leave me here with
                    him.
          
          peter and lucy laugh, not realizing that carl is serious.
          they leave.
