          int. carl's living room/bedroom
          
          carl's in front of his computer. there are a bunch of emails
          selling viagra. he angrily deletes them all. he gets a
          letter from the king of nigeria.
          
                              nigerian king (v.o.)
                    dear carl, it is vitally important
                    you send me your bank account
                    information. the government will
                    be closing in on my account in the
                    very near future. your good
                    friend, omar, former king of
                    nigeria.
          
          carl starts typing fast. as carl writes the following email,
          we cuts of him throwing away the boxes of stuff he bought
          over the internet and giving away the six kittens he got to
          the aspca.
          
                                                                   121.
          
          
          
                              carl (v.o.)
                    omar, let's cut the crap. you are
                    not a king. you're probably just a
                    teenage con artist jerking off
                    somewhere in russia. write me
                    again and i will find you and beat
                    your stupid lying face in. dick.
                    sincerely, carl kendall.
          
          carl angrily flips off his computer.
