          int. carl's new office
          
          carl's writing a list of names. the post card lies on the
          desk nearby. his secretary pops her head in.
          
                              carl's secretary
                    the executives are gathering in the
                    conference room to officially greet
                    the kbi officials.

                    it's an elderly orangutan actually.
                        (handing her the list)
                    could you please call everyone on
                    this list and tell them to show up
                    at rudy's bar & grille this evening
                    at 9pm?
          
                               carl's secretary
                    will do.
          
          carl starts to head out and then turns around.
          
                               carl
                    i just want to say, it was really
                    great having you as my first
                    secretary.
          
                              carl's secretary
                    you're not firing me, are you?
          
                              carl
                    i don't think i'm going to be
                    working here much longer.
