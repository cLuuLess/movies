          int. coffee shop
          
          carl sits across from renee.
          
                              renee
                    so you've just been saying yes to
                    everything.
          
                                 carl
                    yes.
                        (then)
                    pardon the pun.
          
                                 renee
                    oh.
          
                              carl
                    see? do you get it now? it's
                    nothing, just a glitch really.
          
                                                                  112.
          
          
          
                              renee
                    i thought we had so much in common
                    but if you just yes to everything i
                    don't know that we do. how do i
                    know if you even like korean food?
          
          beat.
          
                                carl
                    i don't.
          
                              renee
                    do you even want to travel around
                    the world at all or do you want to
                    work at that bank and buy a lot of
                    prada suits?
          
                              carl
                        (confused)
                    yes. and yes.
          
          something registers in renee.
          
                              renee
                    when i asked if you were falling
                    for me all you said was yes.
          
          she rises, shaking her head, and heads for the door.
          
                              carl
                    it wasn't a lie.
          
                                renee
                    yes.    it was.
