          int. carl's apartment - late night
          
          carl flips on his computer. he's trashed.     he has a bunch of
          emails. he clicks on the email.
          
                                nigerian king (v.o.)
                    dear   brother carl, thank you for
                    your   last note you sent me. but we
                    must   move quickly. i must have
                    your   bank details right now. send
                    them   to me. your associate, omar,
                    king   of nigeria
          
                              carl
                        (while typing)
                    dear omar, while i appreciate the
                    gravity of your situation, perhaps
                    a goodwill branch is in order.
                    could you perhaps loan me a million
                    and take it out of my final cut?
                    then i will happily send you my
                    bank details. sincerely, carl.
          
          carl then flips on persianwifefinder.com.    a persian cartoon
          genie comes onto the screen.
          
                              persian cartoon genie
                    sa'laam, carl. you have sixty-five
                    winks. allah akbar.
          
          the screen is suddenly filled with pictures of persian women.
