          int. southwest bank - lobby
          
          carl stands in the middle of the floor staring into the
          middle distance. a customer approaches him.
          
                               bank customer
                    hey, i need to speak to a loan
                    specialist and there's no one on
                    the floor.
          
                             carl
                    sorry. today i'm officially a
                    greeter.
          
          beat.
          
                              bank customer
                    but there's no one around.
          
                              carl
                    someone might come. and if i'm not
                    here, they won't be greeted.
          
                              bank customer
                    you're really not going to help me?
          
                              carl
                    until i'm relieved as a greeter, my
                    hands are tied.
          
          the bank customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area
          as carl stands in the middle of the floor. it is very
          awkward. no one comes in. carl slowly moves so a column
          blocks the customer's view of him.
          
          now that carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the
          entrance of the bank. through the floor to ceiling windows,
          he sees the handsome new president of southwest bank, chris
          parker, tear up in a mercedes. he steps out of the mercedes
          with a hot girl on his arm. he and the girl walk into the
          bank. carl stares at them, jealously.
          
                                                                        6.
          
          
          
                              chris parker
                    hey, there. i'm chris parker. the
                    new president of southwest bank.
                    just wanted to come by and
                    personally introduce myself to
                    every branch manager.
          
                              norman
                    that would be me.   norman calhoun.
          
          chris turns to carl.
          
                              carl
                    i'm carl kendall.   just a teller.
          
                              chris parker
                    i was "just a teller." and now i'm
                    "just president of the largest bank
                    in the southwest."
                        (to norman)
                    you need anything, you let
                    corporate know. you hear?
          
                              norman
                    definitely.
          
          chris parker and his hot secretary leaves.     carl watches
          them, clearly jealous.
          
                              norman (cont'd)
                    nice work if you can get it.   am i
                    right?
          
                              carl
                        (clearly jealous)
                    yeah, if you're into fake breasts
                    and german engineering.
          
                              norman
                    check and check.
          
          the bank customer comes around.
          
                              bank customer
                    can you help me now?
          
                              carl
                    no, but this gentleman can.
          
          carl indicates norman.   norman goes to help the customer.
          
                                                                       7.
