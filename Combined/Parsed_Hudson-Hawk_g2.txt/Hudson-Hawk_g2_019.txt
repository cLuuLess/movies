     alex puts the last of the monday tapes into a v.c.r.

                             alex
               you got about five minutes and
               change.

                             hawk
               5:32.  "swinging on a star."

                             alex
               you know they invented something
               while you were inside.  called a
               watch.

     a freight elevator pings.  hawk opens it up as the music
     of "swinging on the star" kicks in on the soundtrack.

                             hawk
               "a mule is an animal with long
               funny ears."

                             alex
               "he kicks up at anything he
               hears.

     hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his
     glad bag.  strenuously upbeat ray conniffesque singers
     continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
     hawk isn't.
