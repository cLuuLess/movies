     ext. e.u.r. district building--day

     hawk and darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
     fascistly marble superstructure.  alfred brings up the
     rear.

                             darwin
               so hawkasaurus, i won't mince
               words...

                             hawk
               whatever.  you own boardwalk, you
               own park place, you own the four
               railroads.  you think you're god.
               for all i know, you're probably
               right.  i just wanted to have a
               damn cappuccino, maybe play some
               nintendo after i find out what it
               is.  man, why didn't you just buy
               the horse?  what am i saying, you
               did buy it...

                             darwin
               oh... let's see.  there are
               organizations that think we wanted
               the "sforza" for reasons other
               than putting it in the da vinci
               museum we're building in vinci.
               hopefully, these organizations
               think our plan has been ruined
               with the explosion of our replica.
               if i seem vague, grand.  we want a
               low profile on this, that's why i
               got kaplan and the candy bars
               involved.  i helped george help
               the mario brothers and gates help
               get you out....

                             hawk
               if you're pausing for a "thank you,"
               give it up.  so boss, you going to
               tell me what the crystal piece
               inside the pony means?

                             darwin
               way to go, alfie!  how many people
               did you break that thing in front
               of.   good help's hard to find.

                             hawk
               i guess that's a no.
