     ext. another table--night

     at a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
     snickers is being an uglier american to an uncomprehending
     waiter, while almond joy chuckles and butterfinger spreads
     butter over an entire baguette.

                             snickers
               come on, pierre, steak-bur-ger,
               fren-n-ch fries.  this is france,
               you gotta have french.....

                             almond joy
               actually we're in italy, snickers,
               she said as if it made a difference.

     the waiter sneaks off.  butterfinger devours his bread.

                             snickers
               italy, france, moscow.  they all
               just wanna be nebraska.  old man
               kaplan thinks since communism is
               dead, we got nothing to do.  man,
               democracy isn't free elections.
               we gotta teach the world that
               democracy is big tits, college
               football on saturdays, eddie
               murphy saying the word "fuck"
               and kids putting their hands down
               garbage disposals on "america's
               funniest home videos."

                             almond joy
               damn baby, when's the last time
               you had a vacation...jesus, i
               gotta get out of this job.  if
               my mom knew her daughter
               assassinated the leader of the
               anti-apartheid movement....

                             snickers
               quit bitching, you got the
               employee of the month plaque for
               that shit...ah to be in pari-is
               and in love.

     they look off to....

     hawk and anna's table

     physically sarcastic, the waiter brings a tall wine
     basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.  hawk nabs it.

                             hawk
               this is bueno.  they had the worst
               ketchup in prison.....uh...

                             anna
               prison?

                             hawk
               i was the warden?

                             anna
               how long were you in?

                             hawk
               let's just say, i never saw e.t.

                             anna
               wow, you were "in the joint."
               "doing hard time."  it's funny,
               but that excites me.  i seem to
               have a thing for sinners.

                             hawk
               i seem to have a thing for sinning.
               sinning.  check please....

                             waiter
               ah, anything for dessert?

                             anna
                       (she shoots)
               yes.  something to go.

                             hawk
                       (she scores)
               i'll bring the ketchup.
