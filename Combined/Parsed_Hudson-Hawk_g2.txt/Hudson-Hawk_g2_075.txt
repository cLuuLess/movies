     ext. the kremlin grounds

     dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, hawk,
     alex, and anna crawl across the kremlin grounds.  they
     scope out a shabby delivery entrance.

                             alex
               delivery entrance.  low security.

                             anna
               gum.

     all three spit out their gum into hawk's bag.

                             hawk
               count of three?

                             alex
               why not just go now?

                             hawk
               okay.

     the trio rush for the door.

     the kremlin roof

     soviet guard one comes out on the roof to light a cig-
     arette.  he looks in the distance to the motivating cia
     team.  suddenly a card floats down into his hand.

     it reads:   william tell.  adam's apple.  get it?

     the not-getting-it guard looks up from the card as a
     grinning kit kat parachutes behind him.  the guard
     swerves around and kit kat savagely skewers him with a
     crossbow shot to his adam's apple.

     the delivery entrance

     hawk, anna, and alex race to the door, the latter
     bashes it...
