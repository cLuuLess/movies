     int. a very long, enigmatic hallway

     hawk, alex, and anna pass through a set of windowed
     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a
     pitch darkness.  a mural of a happy, arm-stretched lenin
     looms above the doors.  they give it a a quick glance
     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

                             alex
               eighth room down, babe...

                             anna
               guards come exactly every three
               minutes....

                             hawk
               three.  oh.  oh.  "side by side."

     our trio charges down the hallway.

                             hawk
               "oh, we ain't got a barrel of
               money.

                             alex
               "maybe we're ragged and funny."

     they reach a massive spooky door with an odd, ancient
     lock.  they go to work on it.  not losing the beat.

                             hawk and alex
               "but we'll travel along, singing
               a song.  side by side..."
