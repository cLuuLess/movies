     int. darkened auction auditorium office

     hawk and alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and
     rub their funny bones.  alex stops laughing.

                             alex
               i'm not as unpleasantly plump as
               that guard am i.

     big stan fires off a warning shot.  hawk and alex quickly
     tear up a window.

     moving out on to a ledge, hawk and alex look down to the
     huge auction house awning and trade gulps.

     big stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door.

                             hawk and alex
               i got a bad feeling....

                             hawk
               i can't even swim.

                             alex
               hell, the fall'll probably kill
               ya...

     big stan raises his gun.

     hawk and alex jump and aaagh down the face of the
     building....

     closer and closer to the awning....

     the viewer focuses upon hawk as he free-falls......

                                                cut to:

     right into a laz-y-boy chair

     hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge
     reclining chair.  the foot stand swooshes out with a
     thump.  a hand pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle.
