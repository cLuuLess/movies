     int. the g. machine room--night

     kaplan, hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
     room of the opening scene.  in the place of where one
     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
     which are unassembled parts of the machine.

     inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
     machine.  in tennis gear and goggles, darwin mayflower
     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

     also in tennis threads, minerva is laying on a chaise
     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.

                             darwin
               seven!

     minerva turns the gadget up to seven and presses a
     button.  another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.
     darwin batters it.  the ball ricochets into the forehead
     of an "amused" alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat
     pants.

                             alfred
               jolly.  good.  shot.  sir.

                             minerva
               ooh, it's hudson hawk, you cease
               to amaze me, convict.  you are a
               terrible cat burglar!

                             darwin
               haven't you ever seen, like david
               niven?  you know tiptoe in, tiptoe
               out.

                             minerva
               like a "cat", one could say.

                             hawk
               shucks, i'll just take it back.

     hawk reaches for the codex.  kaplan pulls it over to
     darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient
     binding.  taking a knife from kaplan, he begins to slit
     it open.

                             minerva
                       (bouncing up)
               no, let me!

                             darwin
                       (pout)
               i don't care.

     hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange
     machine parts behind them.

     minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-
     cally perverted crystal.

                             hawk
               another piece of the puzzle for
               the da vinci alchemy project.

     kaplan, darwin, and minerva look up to hawk, then to each
     other, all start to speak, then all stop.

     this quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin
     flunkies.

                             darwin
               oh, you.  there's nothing more i
               hate than failure.  all you had to
               do was follow the hawk, it's not
               like i said "teach our nation's
               children how to read."

     hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.

                             darwin
               i guess we're just going to have
               to kill 'em...

     shockingly swift, minerva pulls a small gun from beneath
     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each
     set of flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

                             darwin
               god minerva, i was kidding.

     a shocked hawk

     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a
     sheet.  he reveals the familiar gold machine demonhead.

     the mayflowers

     reverberate off each other with laughter.  bloodstained,
     kaplan and almond joy exchange an eye bulge.  minerva's
     smile disappears as she sees hawk by the sheets.

                             minerva
               get away from there, convict!

                             hawk
               just browsing.  don't touch me....

     snickers touches him.  hawk smashes him in the jaw.
     snickers rears back to reciprocate....

                             darwin
               don't hurt him!  we need him for
               the final job!

     snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration.  hawk is
     suddenly the happiest man he's been in italy.

                             hawk
               oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me?  even
               if i do this....

     hawk pulls snickers' glasses off and stamps them.

                             hawk
               and this....

     hawk knees butterfinger in the stomach.

                             hawk
               surely this must offend....

     hawk body-block-dominoes butterfinger and snickers to the
     ground.  kaplan and almond joy aim their guns.

                             kaplan
               that's it!

     playfully lifting his shirt, hawk grabs minerva and
     manually swivels her hips to the beat of his.

                             hawk
               things are getting a little loose
               at the da vinci workshop tonight.
               "put your left leg in, take your
               right foot out."  may i call you
               minnie....

     hawk mambos to alfred who rifles his blade up to hawk's
     crotch.  hawk stops dancing.

                             darwin
               come to think of it there is a part
               of your body that you won't need for
               your next job...

                             hawk
               hey, guys, i've always wanted to sing
               like franki valli and the other seasons,
               but come on....

     alfred moves the blade a little upward.  hawk a-a-ghs.

                             minerva
               big girls don't cry-i-eye.

                             hawk
               two minutes, 35 seconds.  damnit,
               i'm involved in this thing, so i
               just wanna know what this thing is.
               i wanna be treated as an adult.

                             darwin
               that's fair.  tomorrow.  back in
               rome.  now go to your room.

     alfred strategically vulcans hawk on the neck.  he falls.
