     int. the limousine

     hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine
     in stylish italian sunglasses.

                             hawk
               i'm robbing the vatican.  the nuns
               at st. agnes predicted that i'd end
               up doing this...

     two identical twin flunkies sit across from him, grinning
     stupidly.  hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle
     finger.
