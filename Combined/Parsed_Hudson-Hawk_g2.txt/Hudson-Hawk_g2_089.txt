     ext. the road to the castle

     the glider floats to a perfect landing before the
     unforgettable juggler.

                             juggler
                         che pazzo....

     hawk and anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
     billowing castle.  they smile and gush in relief.  they
     wrap arms around the confused but warming up juggler and
     laugh again.

     a small piazza

     the mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
     of dawn.  hawk, anna, and the unforgettable juggler ride
     atop it.

     a woman with an unforgettably etched face moves to a cafe
     table with a luminous smile.  she unfolds a table cloth
     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.

     hawk and anna dismount, thank the juggler, then cozy into
     the table.

                             hawk
               have i ever told you the world is
               beautiful...
                       (semi-seductively)
               i'd really like to play
               nintendo with you, or something...

                             anna
               hudson, i'm afraid i'm sticking
               with god.
                       (smiling)
               but you're a close second, tough
               guy.  what is that smile?

                             hawk
                       (broadly grinning)
               i got my planet back.

     hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
     the ones da vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

                             hawk
               the first one's for alex.  cheers.

     the viewer's viewpoint moves into hawk's lips having a
     sip of that damn unmasculine european coffee.
