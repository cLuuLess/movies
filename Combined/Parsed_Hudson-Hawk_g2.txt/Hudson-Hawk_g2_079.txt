     int. a grand ballroom

     the good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic
     and gorgeous ballroom.  two lush staircases lead up from
     the floor.  from behind a pillar, the gang checks out
     the activity below.

     a tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at
     the opposite end of the ballroom by servants.  threaten-
     ing soviet soldiers maneuver on the floor.

                             hawk
                       (wizard of oz)
               oh-eee-oh-a-whoa-oh.

     they then make a mad scuffle across their side of the
     second level, hunkering down by the level railing.

     as they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's
     viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see
     a gloating darwin and minerva enter, the latter still
     on the phone.

                             minerva
               everybody here, in rome, wishes
               you tinsel boxes of love...

     the servants move away from the tablecloth and the
     table, revealing that it is shaped like an m.  a group
     of serious soviet v.i.p.'s come out to join the
     mayflowers at the table.

     the roof

     kaplan hangs up the phone.

                             kaplan
               lazy, rich, condescending bitch.

     the team moves up to the rooftop doorway where kit kat
     is.  he holds up an "about time" card.  the agents laugh
     and greet them.
