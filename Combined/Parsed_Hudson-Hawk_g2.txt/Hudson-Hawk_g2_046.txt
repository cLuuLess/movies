     int. piazza--day

     hawk pokes his head to see a darwin and minerva (holding
     bunny) emerge from the limousine.  as he turns his con-
     centration back to the phone, alex himself flows out from
     a building to cheerfully speak with darwin and minerva
     and get licked by bunny, before they all pile into the
     limo.

                             hawk
               a-lex, a-lex, come on alex.

     hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
     pull off.

     hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully
     clotheslined by agent butterfinger, who is dressed as
     a mailman.

     crumpled on the ground, hawk kicks out with his foot,
     into butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. hawk then
     grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the
     booth.

     hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the
     cia crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns;
     snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, almond joy as a bermuda
     tourist, and kaplan in his usual emsemble.  kit kat is
     dressed exactly like hawk, right down to a bloody lip.
     hawk gives him a double take.

                             kaplan
               hawk, hawk, hawk.  enjoying
               italy?  i always had a soft spot
               for rome.  did my first barehanded
               strangulation here.  communist
               politician.

                             hawk
               why george, you big softie...

                             kaplan
               god, i miss communism.  the red
               threat.  people were scared, the
               agency was respected, and i got
               laid every night.

     a humiliated butterfinger comes waddling out, holding
     the phone.  kaplan rolls his eyes.

                             butterfinger
               sorry, coach...

                             kaplan
                       (shaking his head)
               if his father wasn't the head of
               shit, i hate this, the
               government's got me farmed out,
               working for the mayflower
               corporation now, money beats
               politics.  war isn't hell anymore,
               it's dull.  don't slaughter their
               men and rape their women, just
               steal their microchips.

                             hawk
               you know kaplan, if you weren't
               the slimiest pinata of shit that
               ever lived, i'd feel sorry for
               you.

                             snickers
               good news, bud, the mayflowers
               have moved up the time-table.
               you're hitting the vatican to-night.

                             hawk
               tonight?  you're whacked.  the
               timing's off, i'm underequipped
               damnit, i have a date!

     almond joy smoothly extracts hawk's notebook and reads...

                             almond joy
               grapple, biker's bottle, hairspray,
               black turtleneck, pocket
               fisherman, acid, collapsible
               yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps.
               gee stud, this is going to be
               some date.  no harvey's bristol
               cream?

                             kaplan
               snickers, make the list happen.
               oh and it's one thing to play
               hide and seek with the mayflower's
               pathetic staff, but we're sore
               losers.  i've put jumper cables
               on the nipples of children and
               not always in the line of duty.

                             hawk
               thanks for sharing.

                             kaplan
               we blow up space shuttles for
               breakfast.  you and your friend
               alex would be a late afternoon
               triscuit.

                             hawk
               if you do anything to my friend...

                             kaplan
               yeah, right.  by the way, as long
               as i'm getting things off my
               chest, i'm the one who killed your
               little monkey.  made it look like
               a mafia hit.  did it for fun.
               ciao.

     kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different
     directions as hawk howls in frustration.  kit kat moves
     behind hawk and perfectly mimics him.

                             hawk
               what did you have against little
               eddie, motherfucker?  he was just
               a monkey who liked to laugh.
               come back without your yuppie
               army.  i'll triscuit you, you
               space shuttle eating...shit.!

     without looking, hawk elbows the mimic kit kat in the
     face.  kit kat gives hawk a strange smile and hands him
     a card that reads:  beware the odd steps.

     hawk looks up from the card.  kit kat is gone, but
     butterfinger scampers in his place.

                             butterfinger
               hey, mr. hawk, i got those 72
               stamps!

     sighing, hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.
