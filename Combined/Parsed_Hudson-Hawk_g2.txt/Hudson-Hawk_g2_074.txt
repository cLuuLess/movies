     kaplan, snickers, almond joy, and butterfinger slam down
     upon the roof of the kremlin and discard their
     parachutes.

     snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
     image-map of the kremlin with a flashing blue light at
     the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.

               we are the blue light.  the green
               light is where the art treasures
               room is.

                             kaplan
               let's go make a purple light.
