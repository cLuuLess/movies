       int. anna's house--night

       the viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas
       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot anna is straddling
       a bare-backed hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his
       bruises.

                             anna
               what have you been doing?

                             hawk
               uh....old badminton injury.

     anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  she stops
     herself and opts for tickling.

                             hawk
               tickles, tickles, tickles.

                             anna
                       (not stopping)
               oh, i'm so sorry...

     roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.
     hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  anna closes
     her eyes and arches her back.....

     she opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring
     right at her.  with a gasp, she rolls away from hawk
     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.

                             anna
               i'm sorry.  i can't.  i....

                             hawk
                       (softly approaching)
               hey now, outside of a very
               friendly dog this morning, it's
               been a slow decade.  i don't make
               love every ten years, i get a
               little cranky.

                             anna
               it's also been a long time for
               me.  i--

     their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until
     the crucifix lights up and begins shouting in italian.

                             hawk
               catholic girls are scary...

                            anna
               somebody robbed the vatican.

                            hawk
               oh.  no.

     anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
     she bumps into the canvas bag.  the codex slides out.
     they both catch it in mid-air.  anna's eyes pop.  she
     wrenches the codex away and kicks.  hawk pulls her into
     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.  the codex
     falls to the floor unharmed.

                             hawk
               it's not what you think.  okay,
               maybe it is....

                             anna
               you really went and did it.  with
               one day, not even a day, of
               planning, you did it.  nobody
               does it better, hudson.  you
               started the week stealing the
               sforza and you ended it swiping
               the codex.

                             hawk
               wha--

                             anna
               what are your plans for the
               weekend?  hoisting away the
               colosseum?  tell me, did the
               devil make you do it or did
               darwin and minerva mayflower?
