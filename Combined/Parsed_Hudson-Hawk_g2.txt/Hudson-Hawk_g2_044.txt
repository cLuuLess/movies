     int. a big quirky phone booth

     hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

                             hawk
               hello, operator.  i'd like to
               make a collect call to new york
               number...

     the mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
     behind an oblivious hawk.

                             hawk
               thank you, operator, thank you.

     hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear.  seeing the
     limo, he freaks and balls himself into a corner.

                             hawk
               come on, alex, pick up, you
               reindeer goat cheese-eating
               motherfucker.
