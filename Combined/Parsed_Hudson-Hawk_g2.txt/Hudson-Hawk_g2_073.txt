     int. a van-bus--night

     a head-rubbing hawk and a stomach rubbing alex kneel on
     the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing
     of what was so neatly delineated on the cia computer.
     both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.

                             alex
               we're going in from the ground
               floor.

                             hawk
               geez, this art treasures room
               looks like a burnt diaphragm.

     hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat.  anna
     is revealed to be driving in her habit.  hawk gives her
     a kiss.

                             hawk
               hey, don't take your disguise so
               seriously.

                             anna
               uh, yeah.  guess i'm a wee bit
               nervous.  i'm sorry i could only
               score clergy passports.

                             hawk
               fits my new image.  a thief for
               the masses.  this is one job i'm
               not going to feel guilty about
               enjoying.  gum.

     hawk, alex, and anna all spit out their gum into a bag
     hawk holds.

                             alex
               the security's actually not that
               severe.

                             anna
               it doesn't have to be.  everybody
               knows that if you mess with the
               kremlin, you'll end up in a
               siberian gulag eating your own
               fingernails.

     hawk takes in some views of moscow that remind one of
     budapest.

                             hawk
               shwoof, that makes me feel better.
               i can't believe this is the iron
               curtain.  all the guy at airport
               customs wanted to know was "who
               shot j.r.?"

                             alex
               you sound disappointed.

                             hawk
               yeah, i mean, come on, going
               through the iron curtain is
               supposed to be crawling
               underneath barbed wire, it's
               supposed to be strangling a
               guard...

     the van

     passes a textbook shot of the kremlin in the distance.

                             hawk (v.o.)
               it's supposed to be parachuting
               in the moonlight....
