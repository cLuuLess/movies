     int. top floor hallway

     with a gust of wind, kaplan and the candy bars bluster
     through the rooftop door into another hallway, where
     soviet guards two and three are taking it easy.

                             kaplan
               create a diversion.

     snickers and butterfinger calmly blow away both guards
     with silenced mini-uzis.

     soviet guard four rushes out a door before the agents,
     zipping up his fly.  almond joy twists his neck with an
     agonizing snap.

     the long hallway

     hawk, anna, and alex retreat beneath the lenin mural
     through the windowed double doors.

     behind the doors, they poke up to see a bespectacled
     guard emerge from the darkness to check out the door.

                             alex
               now that's a lock.

                             hawk
               don't worry, we'll get it...

                             anna
               can i sing this time, too?
               please?

     hawk and alex are not thrilled about the idea, but anna's
     eye flutter does it.

                             hawk
               uh, i guess so.

     the bespectacled guard moves back into the darkness.

     the ballroom

     the soviet v.i.p.'s open up presents of pink l.a. gear
     tennis shoes, silly t-shirts, and nintendo joysticks
     as a standing darwin hypnotizes them.

                             darwin
               i look at you soviet people and i
               feel... pity... superiority.  most
               of your life, your government has
               told you that capitalism turns
               people into robots who'd rather
               eat microwave sushi, naked in the
               back of a cadillac than hear the
               laughter of children.

                             minerva
                       (smiling)
               we're here to say, your government
               was right.

                             darwin
               so let's get busy.  have some fun
               and make some deals.

     at the lock

     alex holds a lit match into the lock, while hawk
     does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver.
     they are improvising...

                             hawk
               "oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"

                             alex
               "how'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"

     anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that hawk and
     alex can barely concentrate.

                             anna
               "but we'll travel the road, sharing
               the load.  side by side!"

     the hallway above

     the cia team saunters through corpses up to a door
     similar in lock and design to the one hawk and alex
     are working on.

     snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly
     above the green light.

                             snickers
               this is the room above the art
               treasures room.  the lock is a
               natalya z-z, first created...

                             almond joy
               snickers, baby, i love you like a
               brother, but really, who cares?
               silencer bomb...

     butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange
     rifle.  he attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased,
     suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel.  he fires
     the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

     behind the windowed double doors

     come hawk, alex, and anna, panting.

                             hawk
               that was close....

                             alex
               anna, i think you better stay....

                             hawk
               you can be lookout!.....  take
               alex's gun.

     alex hands anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a little
     sister not allowed to play.  hawk and alex go back through
     the doors.

     the hallway above

     the cia bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer
     sound.  kaplan and the candy bars giddily whoop as they
     rush through the smoking door.

     the ballroom--second level

     anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself
     in italian and amusingly imitating hawk's condescension.

                             anna
               "you can be the lookout."

     anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the mayflowers
     and the v.i.p.s.  she gasps and hurls herself behind the
     second level railing.

     the ballroom floor

     a very dignified soviet leader, in a shit happens baseball
     cap, addresses darwin.

                             soviet leader
               before we serve you "the main course,"
               hee, hee, we need to know specifics
               about what you can do for us.  we--

                             darwin
               bluntness.  how amusingly hungarian.
               listen up, for reasons i don't want
               to get into, i recently had to close
               down a petroleum factory, but i'm
               going to re-build it here and
               madonna's going to cut the ribbon!
               frozen burritos in leningrad.  1982
               fantasy.  1992 reality.

     the lock outside the door

     hawk and alex more frantically toil on the lock.

                             hawk
               "we all had our quarrels and
               parted..."

                             alex
               "but we'll be the same as we started...

     the lock clunks open.  they race through the doors into...
