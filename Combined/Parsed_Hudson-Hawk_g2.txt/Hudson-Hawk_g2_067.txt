     int. the cardinal's side of the confession booth

     the cardinal suppresses a yawn.

                             cardinal
               hit me with your best shot.

                             anna (o.s.)
               i betrayed a man.  a good man.  an
               innocent man.  a thief.

                             cardinal
               anna, what are you trying to say...

     anna's darkened lips

                             anna
               he came into a world where crime
               is a legitimate business tactic
               and a legitimate government
               procedure.  but he knew right and
               wrong.  oh, and we kind of messed
               around...

     the cardinal

     freaks and goes into some italian gibberish before...

                             cardinal
               "messed around" messed around?  i
               know-- i don't want to know.  first
               base?  second base?  stop me when
               i'm getting warm...

                             anna (o.s.)
               a little petting is not the issue!

                             cardinal
               sorry.  seventeen hail marys and
               five minutes outside.
