     ext. the roof

     hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.

     the vatican guard pops out of the window and fires a
     warning shot.

     hawk stretches to the bag.  his fingers touch as the
     guard continues to bound forward.

                             hawk
               please god, please god.......let
               the guard shoot me.

     hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see vatican
     guard hovering over him on the roof.

                             vatican guard
               the worm's on the other foot,
               yankee noodle candy.

     hawk sees the vatican guard's foot move toward the
     grapple.  hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the guard
     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.
