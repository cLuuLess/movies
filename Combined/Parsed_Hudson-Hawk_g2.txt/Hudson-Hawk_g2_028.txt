     ext. the ambulance

     crashes through a gate-arm of another lane.  hawk and the
     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.

     front seat of the ambulance

     cesar pops his head through the partition.

                             cesar
               make him into roadkill!

     antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
     his skull, pokes his head next to cesar's.

                             antony
               yeah, run him down!

     cesar and the bodyguard/driver turn to antony and scream,
     then all three look out the windshield and scream.

     the ambulance

     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
     fiery ball.

     in the foreground, hawk's gurney coasts down

     a peaceful off-road

     hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
     stop.

     lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
     carrying a steel suitcase.  he kneels before hawk and
     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
     tus.  he begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

     a malevolent, silent deadpan wraith passes him and
     approaches hawk.  both men are dressed in outfits that
     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
     couture.

     on the fingers of one wraith hand is carved the word
     hate.  on the other hand is the word frog.  the frog hand
     hands a befuddled hawk a card.  it reads: my name is kit
     kat and this is not a dream.

     hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as kit kat chops
     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

     the sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.

                             hawk
               this is the worst night...

                             snickers
               when it rains, it pours.  name's
               snickers.  the plane leaves in 40.

     snickers zaps hawk in the leg with his device.  hawk a-
     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  snickers returns to his
     suitcase and is passed by a pleasant young black woman in
     the "outfit."

                             almond joy
               almond joy.  i know, pretty silly.
               but it's better than when we first
               started out, our code names were
               diseases.  you don't know what
               it's like being called clymidia
               for a year.
                       (walking off)
               whoops, forgot....

     she deftly kicks hawk across the face.  hawk angrily
     bounds back up until he sees the biggest member of the
     group fe-fi-fo-fum his way toward them.  suddenly, the
     giant clumsily trips over snickers' suitcase apparatus
     and ram-collapses into hawk and the gurney.  laying atop
     hawk, butterfinger goofily speaks...

                             butterfinger
               my name's butterfinger.

                             hawk
               no shit.

     the mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
     that screams old time cia.  his name will be george
     kaplan.

                             kaplan
               don't you just hate kids...

                             almond joy
               george, you promised.  no old cia/
               new cia jokes...

                             kaplan
               i call them the mtv.i.a.  punks
               think bay of pigs is an herbal tea.
               they think the cold war involves
               penguins and...

                             hawk
               don't i know you...

                             kaplan
               you just might.  i'm the guy who
               tricked you into robbing a
               government installation and then
               had you sent to prison for it.  at
               the time, i was bald with a beard,
               no moustache, and i had a different
               nose, so if you don't recognize me,
               i won't be offended.

                             hawk
               bastard, you're going to need
               another nose!

     hawk explodes upward.  everyone but cool kaplan draws a
     gun.

                             hawk
               but i'm not the type of guy to
               hold a grudge.

                             kaplan
               i used you as a diversion.  while
               you were getting captured upstairs,
               i was shredding documents in the
               basement.  deep down, i guess i
               was just jealous.  you were one
               incredible thief...

                             hawk
               to what do i owe the dishonor of a
               reunion, you centrally intelligent
               scumsicle.

     as kaplan converses, snickers and butterfinger bring out
     a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind hawk.

                             kaplan
               i want to make things up to you.
               that's why i got you this gig,
               doll.  hawk, my name's george
               kaplan and to quote the late,
               great karen carpenter, "we've only
               just begun."

                             hawk
               three minutes, twenty-three
               seconds.  if you think i'm doing
               another...

                             kaplan
               hush.  my employer wants a meeting.

                             hawk
               employer?  the president?

                             kaplan
               no, somebody powerful.  oh.  look.
               what's that up there?

                             hawk
               i'm supposed to fall for that?

                             kaplan
               shucks.  guess not.

     kaplan savagely point-blank punches hawk in the face,
     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
     snickers slams it shut revealing a kennedy international
     sticker.
