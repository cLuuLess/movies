     ext. a vinci countryside tree

     a man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  it is the
     traveling juggler with the unforgettably etched face.

     he pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
     he begins a stoic juggle when another loud boom sends him
     to the ground.
