     int. alex's bar--night

     it's changed.  hawk and alex enter into what has become
     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
     packed with noisy, insufferably self-absorbed yups.
     a violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
     elevated t.v. sets set up all around the place.

     hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening couple
     toasting wine coolers, and two very young brokers high-
     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                             alex
               i didn't know how to tell you.  a
               couple brokers stopped in for
               stoley spritzers one night.  next
               thing i know fast track digest
               votes us "watering hole of the
               month."  now, i'm shopping for
               aqua salmon wallpaper.

                             hawk
               i read about these people in
               newsweek.  where's all the
               regulars, crazy jeff cava, the
               todd sisters, indian joe?  where's
               ed kranepool's autograph?  captain
               bob's steering wheel?

                             alex
               hey, get this irritable guy a
               cappuccino.  i gotta go be a boss.

     alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
     snatching up a menu, hawk calls out...

                             hawk
               this is pizza?  reindeer goat
               cheese?  i admit, i've been known
               to go wild and order a canadian
               bacon in my time, but..

     hawk lights up a cigarette.  a tortoise shell non-smoker
     immediately turns to him wearing a "yes, i mind if you
     smoke" button.

                             tortoise shell non-smoker
               can you read.... smoker?

                             hawk
               can you take a sunrise and
               sprinkle it with dew?

                              tortoise shell non-smoker
                       (huh?)
               no.

                              hawk
               the candy man can, felix.  you
               know, i thought this was a country
               where you could do any stupid
               thing you wanted; drive to work
               naked, make love to a v.c.r.
               guess i'm wrong.  maybe that's
               why i became a serial arsonist.

                             tortoise shell non-smoker
               hey, it's okay, big guy.  smoke
               all you want.  have mine....

     the non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
     flees.  a cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the
     bar saloon-style.  a smiling hawk picks it up, turns away
     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his
     lips until a police badge swirls into frame and splashes
     into the cup, splattering coffee over hawk's blazer.

                             gates (o.s.)
               you're under arrest...

     hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and
     cackling island of a man, officer gates, amid the sea
     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by
     a table.

                             gates
               have a seat.  good to see you,
               buddy ol' pal...

                             hawk
               the pleasure's all yours, officer
               gates.

     back of the bar

     with concern, alex watches hawk sit at gates' table.

     gates' table

     gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with
     terrifying precision.  hawk tosses the badge onto the
     food.  gates eats around it.

                             gates
               why do you show your parole
               officer such disrespect?
               especially after i got you such
               a nice job.

                             hawk
               what job?

     gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the
     table.

                             gates
               the auction house, asshole.  one
               night's work and you're free like
               no ex-con's ever been.  no
               checking in with a shrink, no
               community service teaching
               retards how to play air hockey.
               it's a great deal, i can't lie.

                             hawk
               the only thing you can't do is
               get sex for free.  i know i was
               in prison for like basically the
               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't
               you supposed to stop me from
               committing crimes.  you know,
               book-em-dano, call-for-backup,
               give-a-hoot-don't-pollute.

     gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer
     down at hawk.  behind gates, on the t.v. screens, are
     analogous images of disgusting animals and monsters.

                             gates
               you wouldn't be out if it wasn't
               for me!  i did dog and pony for
               you!  you think they would have
               let you out after what you did,
               you told the board members they
               looked like the three stooges...

                             hawk
               how was i supposed to know they
               were women?  besides one of them
               was bald and kept saying
               "soitinly."

     gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.

                             gates
               remember that guy in the cell
               next to you who hung himself?

                             hawk
               yes.

                             gates
               remember that shoe you lost...

                             hawk
               uh, yeah.  cut to the chase.

     gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.

                             gates
               one phone call and your shoe
               will become a piece of evidence
               and that suicide'll become a
               murder.

     hawk bobs under the table and up.

                             hawk
               what else do you got under there
               ... i don't want to be rude, but
               this is all pretty lame.

                             gates
               that's the beauty.  it's bullshit,
               but i can make it stick because
               i'm a good guy parole officer and
               you re a bad guy who's about to
               find out that there's a thin line
               between ex-con and escape con.

     alex suddenly approaches the table.

                             alex
               how is everything tonight, sir?

                             gates
               beat it, alex.  you're a dinosaur.

                             hawk
               alex, did you know this ape was
               going to be here...

                             alex
               sure.  that's why his meatballs
               are made out of marinated chuck
               wagon.

                             gates
                       (mouthful)
               you're full of shit.

     as alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.

                             alex
               no, man, actually you are.  just
               add water and it makes its own
               gravy.  keeps your teeth healthy
               and your coat shiny.

     gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  hawk gets
     up to laugh next to alex.  their laughter dies as they
     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table
     between them.
