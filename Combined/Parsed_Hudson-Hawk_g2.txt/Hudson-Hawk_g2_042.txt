     int. catacomblike area

     a cardinal paces in an enigmatic vatican area.  anna
     clacks up to him.

                             cardinal
               did he mention the mayflowers?

                             anna
               no, your eminence.  i think he's
               going to steal the codex, as
               early as next week.

                             cardinal
               attempt, you mean.  the vanity
               of this man, hudson hawk.  the
               vatican has foiled the advances
               of pirates and terrorists.  we
               will not lie down for some
               schmuck from new jersey.  must
               you flirt with him so realistically?

                             anna
               that's the best kind.  a wise
               woman once said "polite
               conversation is rarely either."

                             cardinal
                       (chuckling)
               let me be the one to quote
               scripture.  ....as an agent of
               our organization, you are put in
               awkward situations.  just
               remember, hudson hawk is an evil,
               evil man.

                             anna
                       (unconvinced)
               yeah.  the big e.
