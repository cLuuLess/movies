     int. the vatican underground subway

     the train rumbles into the vatican mini-station.  two
     harried workers heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting
     table.

     a bell rings as a clock hits 10.  the workers do a sigh
     of relief.  shucking off their uniforms, they head out.

     a hand rips out of the huge package.
