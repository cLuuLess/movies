     int. seventh floor auction auditorium--night

     moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling set of
     hanging horse mobiles, a heavyset guard, big stan, moseys
     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  the
     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
     turbo floor washer.

     next to a painting of happy children riding horses at the
     back of the auditorium stage, big stan hefts himself upon
     a comparatively tiny blue chair and begins to tip back
     and snooze.
