     int. guards' station

     the security guards look to the seventh floor screen to
     see an unfolding shot of big stan mid-snooze.

                             security guard one
               check out big stan...
                       (walkie-talkie)
               big stan!

     the auction auditorium

     startled by his walkie-talkie, big stan falls back on the
     little chair, crunching it to the ground.

     the first floor

     the laughing security guards see the crunch.
