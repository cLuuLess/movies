     ext. castle terrace

     a flying apprentice sails past leonardo in a bat winged
     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  da vinci grins back
     until he touches his pocket.  he pulls out the crystal
     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
     mirror.  he quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
     geometric pieces.

     calming down, da vinci looks from the three components of
     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
     table in his workshop.  he ponders then looks back out to
     the vinci vista.

     the bat winged glider dissolves into:

     a hawk

     who is revealed to be flying over sing sing prison.
