     int. back room--dawn

     hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a
     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  behind him,
     alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  sinatra's
     "witchcraft" blares on the radio....

                             alex
               hmmmm.....

                             hawk
               yo pandora, quit hummm-ing... look
               at this.

     hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,
     "true" bar.  round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of hawk
     and the regs at the bar.  managing a weary smile, hawk
     lifts a ship steering wheel, while alex puts on a pair of
     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

                             hawk
               it's captain bob's steering wheel!
               remember when the captain.....

                             alex
               hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.

     hawk nervously picks up a rubik's cube and holds it
     behind his back.  he brings it back around, completed.
     sighing, hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  alex
     starts rubbing his stomach.  they pace in pre-job
     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

                             hawk
               the safe's a simpson 71.  last
               time i played the game, simpson
               only had a 40.

                             alex
               just means it'll take you an extra
               31 seconds to seduce.  you re
               still the best, i know it.

                             hawk
               but you got three guards who...
               shit, what am i doing?  where's
               the want ads?  gonna sell some
               spatulas.

                             alex
               hey, i'm sorry, man.  i'm putting
               out a fire with kerosene.

     alex gives hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps
     back to reveal he has put hawk into thumbcuffs.

                             hawk
               this isn't funny.  i'm not into
               this.  i...

                             alex
               there goes five seconds...my
               record's eighteen.

                             hawk
               you're not...listening!

     out of annoyance, hawk breaks out of the cuffs and
     violently throws them at alex, who sits down a little
     wounded.

                             hawk
               i'm sorr--goddamn mario brothers.
               goddamn gates.  goddamn rutherford
               auction house.  by the way, how
               many seconds?

                             alex
               rutherford auction... that name...

     alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.

                             hawk
               alex!

                             alex
               don't wet your diapers.  i'll have
               to change them.  "witchcraft."
               what's the running time?

     alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of
     drawings of different kinds of vaults.  he sets himself
     up for an insulin injection.

                             hawk
               3:48.  i can't get you involved,
               man.  this is my sewage and...
                       (re drawings)
               god, you love all this, don't you,
               you bastard.  haven't you ever
               heard of stamp collecting, or
               curling?

     hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to
     alex.

                             alex
               i'm in.  have you seen the public
               service announcements for diabetes.
               we can ride horses, play lacrosse,
               and knock off auction houses.  i
               got a plan.  you won't have to hail
               cesar or gates.

     hawk collapses next to alex, resigned to his fate.

                             hawk
               i'm a bum.
