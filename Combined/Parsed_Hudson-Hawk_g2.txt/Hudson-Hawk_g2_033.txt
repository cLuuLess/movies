     int. massive conference room--day

     a mind-blowingly pretentious painting of darwin, minerva,
     and bunny hangs above a mammoth m-shaped conference table.

     lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-
     stopping dark outfit is minerva.  nasty metal riffs semi-
     audibly spew from a headset she wears.

     surrounding the table is a varied group of old money and
     new money board members ranging from a nine year old
     indian prince to a sweet elderly american woman.  they
     converse to the person at their side in businesslike
     tones, oblivious to minerva.

                             darwin
               ladies and gentlemen of the board...

     the board members go into tableau silence.  minerva con-
     tinues a brief sing-a-long before darwin scolds...

                             darwin
               and min-er-va.  let's give it up
               for hudson hawk.

     the board applauds as alfred pushes hawk inside.

                             minerva
               hello......bunny, ball-ball!

     minerva lobs a ball in the air.  bunny, the annoying dog,
     scurries beside hawk to catch it.

     moving down toward the other end of the table, hawk takes
     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  he sees
     one board member take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
     minerva paces up upon the table.

                             darwin
               hawkmeister, we got you clothes,
               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira
               per diem.

                             minerva
               that's two hundred dollars a day?
               so he can get a hooker and some
               tequila.  veto, darwin.

                             hawk
               guess i know who wears the penis
               in this family.

                             minerva
                       (jumping off table)
               for god's sake, chain this
               convict.

     with a yawn, alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
     handcuffs.

                             hawk
               alfred, you're a very polite
               psychopath, but if you...

     hawk kicks out at alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
     gives a pummel to hawk's body somersaulting him over the
     edge of the table, into an empty seat.

     the board members politely applaud.  alfred pulls hawk's
     hands around his back and cuffs him.  bunny intensely
     sniffs his crotch.

                             minerva
               we want da vinci's sketchbook,
               what do they call it, the codex.

                             darwin
               listen hawk, this might be hard to
               believe, but i'm a regular joe.  i
               just want to be happy and happiness
               comes from the achieving of goals.
               it's just when you make your first
               billion by the age of 19, it's
               hard to keep coming up with new
               ones.  but now finally i got my
               new goal.  world domination.  with
               your help...bunny....quit that!

                             minerva
               bunny, ball-ball!  bad bunny!

                             hawk
               think he's already got today's
               ball-balls.  five more minutes
               please, it's been so long...

     minerva yanks away the yelping dog.

                             hawk
               anybody have a cigarette?  but
               seriously, do me a favor and
               concorde me back to prison.  i
               don't care anymore.  i hope you
               have the receipts for the threads.

                             minerva
               you go back, you won't be alone.
               you'll have a diabetic barkeep
               cellmate.  you're still young
               enough to have fun shanking child
               molesters for a pack of smokes,
               but "alex" will go in knowing that
               the next time he gets out it'll be
               to attend his own funeral.
               depressing.

                             hawk
               you wouldn't risk the dime to call
               the police.  you have no proof.

                             darwin
               ah, the magic word...

     alfred plants a slide machine on the table and darwin
     starts clicking gorgeous images of hawk and alex robbing
     the auction house, on a bare wall.

     the board members gush.  the elderly woman gives a
     thumbs-up.

                             darwin
               it's veja du, hawkhead.  something
               you wish never happened.  we shot
               the entire operation with hidden
               cameras behind the hidden cameras.
               hired the guy who did the last
               sports illustrated swimsuit issue.
               excellent work... whoops, damn
               fotomat assholes...

     a slide hits the wall of himself and minerva kneeling in
     big baby clothes with alfred snarling over them, decked
     out in leather.  he clicks ahead...

     hawk looks away and sees that the board members have an
     annual report-type booklet in front of them that reads--
     the da vinci/alchemy project.

     minerva leans over in front of him.

                             minerva
               tomorrow, you're going to hit a
               church.

                                               cut to:
