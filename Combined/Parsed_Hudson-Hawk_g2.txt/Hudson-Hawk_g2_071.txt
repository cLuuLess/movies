     ext. beautiful rome overview

     out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
     anna looks out to a lovely view of italy.  the vatican truck
     pulls up behind her.  a giddy, blood-stained alex and a not-
     so-giddy hawk bound out of the back.  alex excitedly gives
     himself an insulin shot.

                             anna
               oh thank god, you're dead...

                             alex
               it was so beautiful!  when the
               blanks went off, they...

     hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts alex's jaw.

                             hawk
               you bastard.  you fucked my
               freedom for a lousy job.

                             alex
               but i said i was sorry....

                             hawk
               no sweat, alex, you only made the
               biggest mistake of my life.  what
               was your per-diem?

                             alex
               don't act like you've never committed
               a crime before, hawkins?  i know, i
               made call, when anna tracked me down i...

                             anna
               hudson, don't you understand...

                             hawk
               and you, dr. cappucino, you're lucky
               i don't hit women, assuming you are
               a woman.  i'm not taking anything for
               granted anymore.

                             anna
               i-work-for-a-covert-vatican-humanitarian-
               organization.  the-cia-made-a-fool-of-me.
               i-care-for-you...

                             hawk
               oh.  well, what's this?

     hawk pulls out the demon head that was in the mayflower
     museum from out of his pocket.  anna turns white.

                             anna
               where did you get this?

                             hawk
               you know, the place where you gave
               the bad guys the codex.... the
               mayflower museum.

                             anna
               it's from the machine.  all they
               need is the crystal to run it and
               they have 2/3 of it already.  we
               can't let that happen.

                             alex
               you're saying you want us to beat
               them to the crystal and save the
               world from financial disarray.

                             anna
               something like that.

                             alex
                       (pulling out plane
                        tix)
               well, forget about it.  hawk and i
               are going to rio.  we're hurt,
               we're tired, and a hero ain't
               nothing but a sandwich.  right,
               buddy?...

                             anna
               hudson, god's given you a gift for
               cat burglary, you can t just...

                             hawk
               you better believe i can.  i'm
               sick of people telling me what i
               have to do.

                             anna
               it's that kind of selfish attitude
               that...

                             hawk
               selfish attitude?  i'm just some
               guy who wants a little nap and a
               cappuccino for when he wakes up,
               not too much foam...

                             anna
               you re not "some guy" anymore,
               hudson.  right now, you're the
               only guy.  without your help, i....

     anna looks to hawk with a choked-up expression.  the
     weight of the world on his shoulders, hawk turns away
     to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
     swirling toward peaceful clarity.

                             hawk
               the world is beautiful.  every day
               in prison i made sure to remember
               that.  it's only when i actually
               got out that i forgot.  if i was
               sane, i'd be on that plane to rio.
               but being beaten and abused to
               fulfill some corporation's
               perverted vision does something to
               your mental health.  the world is
               beautiful and i'm tired of being
               fucked.
                       (turning around)
               it's darwin and minerva's turn to
               bite the pillow...

     anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.  alex
     goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.

                             anna
               that was beautiful.

                             alex
               i laughed, i cried.

     shaking his head, hawk swipes the plane tickets from
     alex.

                             hawk
               rio, alex?  after all they've
               done to...hey, these tickets are
               for moscow!

                             alex
                       (knowing smile)
               damn travel agency.  that kremlin
               thing is in moscow, isn't it?

     a proud hawk slaps alex on the back as some passing
     italian locals stop to stare, horrified, at alex's
     bullet holes.  anna sweetly intervenes.

                             anna
               ketchup.  stupido americani...

     the locals give off a slightly dazed "a-a-h" and move off.
