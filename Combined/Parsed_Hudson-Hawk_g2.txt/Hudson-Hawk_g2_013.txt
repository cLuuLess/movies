     ext. nice, business neighborhood--night

     two grubby derelicts, one pushing a shopping cart, the
     other inside it, situated atop the usual two glad bags.
     they are drunkenly warbling "witchcraft."  impeccably
     dressed night-lifers give them a wide berth.

     our derelicts pass beneath a massive red canopy of a
     distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
     rutherford's auction house.  a doorman shoos them away...

     a newspaper truck pulls up in front of the auction house.
     the driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
     a dispenser on the corner.  the bums wheel around the
     truck.  the driver loads the papers and bounds back.

     the truck pulls away from the corner.  the shopping cart
     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.

     the truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
     climbing up the back of it, with glad bags around their
     necks.  the truck moves toward an enclosed walkway bridge
     that connects the auction house with another building.

     launching low-tech grapples, the vagrants latch them-
     selves onto the walkway window as the truck passes
     beneath.

     at the window

     the viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be hawk
     and alex.  getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
     plunger.

                             hawk
               whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
               than that.

                             alex
               hey, you promised......don't worry,
               i'm wearing my girdle.
