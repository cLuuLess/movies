     int. mysterious bare room--day

     hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  he has been put
     in an aggressively fashionable italian outfit.  he eyes
     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  he
     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,
     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of rome, italy as "o
     solo mio" blares on the soundtrack.

                             hawk
               no.  way.

     hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam
     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of scary butler
     alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.

                             alfred
               welcome to rome, sir.

                             hawk
               yes way.
