     int. the back seat of the max-tech limousine

     facing darwin mayflower who is blustering into the
     cellular.

     while he talks, darwin shakes hawk's bewildered hand,
     then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec"
     facial move.

                             darwin
               for those kind of wages, i could
               have built the factory in america!
               they're vietnamese, can't we just
               give them more bart simpson shirts?
               i hear depressing news like this
               and i want to commit genocide!
                       (slamming phone)
               alfred, hold my calls.  so, hawk!
               the hawkster!  what do you think
               of the vehicle?

                             hawk
               you could host american bandstand
               in here.  why did you duck at the
               auction, asshole?

                             darwin
               because i didn't want to get hurt,
               taterhead.

     a fax machine comes to life as darwin babbles.

                             darwin
               what can i tell you, i'm the
               villain.  initially it was a
               priority to keep a lot of buffers
               between you and me, but since most
               of them are dead now, i thought
               what the heck.  hawk, you come
               highly recommended.  i would have
               done some things differently at
               the auction house, but hey, i want
               to be in business with you.

     darwin scans the fax message with annoyance, and then
     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

     outside the limo shredder

     shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.

     inside the limousine

     a simmering hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.

                             hawk
               my life is not some deal.  i...

                             alfred (o.s.)
               it's boston, mr. mayflower.

                             darwin
               i'm sorry, i have to take this.
               those are valid points though...

     darwin picks up the phone and goes mr. hyde, while giving
     hawk "can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

                             darwin
               you better have a good excuse...
               you better have a better excuse!
               you are so weak!  i'm only
               thankful your ancestors didn't
               settle america or else my name
               would be running brave or vomiting
               antelope...really.  well, listen
               close, babe.

     darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
     his armrest.  darwin presses a button and a piercing
     noise fills the car as it comes to a stop.

                             darwin
               shall we?

     darwin bolts out.  hawk hangs back, waiting for rod
     serling to explain things, then bolts out too.
