     int. the freight elevator

     hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator.

                             hawk
               "or would you rather swing on a
               star, carry moonbeams home in a
               jar."

     power room

     alex goes up to a circuit box and pulls down two large
     switches.  the soundtrack singers continue to warble.

     the guards' station

     the lights of the floor wobble and die.  the console
     screens blink off.  the security guards stop laughing.

                             security guard two
               hell-o.  check the power room,
               bud...

     security guard one harrumphs into a standing position...

     power room

     alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the v.c.r.s.
     they now all have their play buttons lit up.

                             alex
               swing on a star, carry moonbeams...

     outside the power room

     security guard one fishes for keys to open the power
     room.  the soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away
     alex.

     inside the power room

     alex briskly slams back up the switches.

     outside the power room

     the singers go louder as the lights come back on.
     security guard one harrumphs and heads back to the
     guards' station.

     the auction auditorium

     hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left
     wall of the auditorium, glancing to the clock.

                             hawk
               "or would you rather be a fish?"

     he pulls out the black canvas bag from his glad bag and
     takes out the blueprints.  hawk follows them toward the
     painting on-stage.

     the guards' station

     big stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping
     the remains of the chair on the floor.

                             big stan
                       (moving back off)
               very funny.

     the seventh floor screen shows a peaceful auction
     auditorium.  and the blue chair.

     the auction auditorium--camera p.o.v.

     from the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state
     of the room with hawk flinging off the painting of the
     horseback children, revealing a safe.  but no blue chair.

     hawk

     spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged
     into a walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the
     dial.

                             hawk
                       (lyric trouble)
               "a fish is annuh nan na nan na
               brook.

     the freight elevator

     alex is now packed into the freight elevator.

                             alex
               "he can't write his name or read
               a book.  to fool people is his
               only thought."

     the auction auditorium

                             hawk
                       (remembering)
               "and though he's slippery, he
               still gets caught."

     wearing headphones, hawk cranks up the walkman and spins
     the dial.  the clicks from the dial are so loud he winces
     and turns down the volume.  then there's a clunk.

     the guards' station

     with the soundtrack singers taking over, guard two sips
     a cup of coffee.  he doesn't swallow.

     his sights zero in on the blue chair on the seventh
     screen.  he looks to the chair remains, then back again.

                             security guard two
               uh, jerry.  i'm looking at the
               seventh floor and i don't know
               how to say this, i see the blue
               chair.

                             security guard one
               what the... you think that's weird,
               check out screen two.....

     screen two shows the two security guards themselves
     hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall.
     guard two looks to the empties atop the console....

                             security guard two
               somebody rewired the recorders!

     auction auditorium

     hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door
     open.

     inside the safe, along with the "holy" da vinci music
     cue, is the clay equestrian model from leonardo's
     worktable.

     hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag.

                             hawk
               "and all the monkeys aren't in
               the zoo."

                             alex (v.o.)
               "every day you meet quite a few."

     alex gives hawk a congratulatory pat.

                             hawk and alex
               "so you see it's all up to you.
               you can be better than you are.
               you could be swinging on a star."

     the auction room

     big stan reconnects the wires of the seventh v.c.r.

     the guards' station

     suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices
     of hawk and alex in-process comes on.

                             security guard one
               shit, let's roll!

     the auction auditorium

     hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the
     playful children.

                             alex
               the song's over!  come on!
               "you could be swinging on a star."

                             hawk
               what am i doing here?  there are
               so many things i wanna do that
               aren't this.  paint a lighthouse.
               kiss a woman in italy.

                             alex
                       (more frantically)
               "you could be swinging on a star."

                             hawk
               paint a woman in a lighthou--i
               don't want to steal a horse.
               life is...

     hawk's soliloquy is cut short as security guards one and
     two crash into the auction auditorium.

                             alex
                       (deadpan)
               "you could be swinging on a star."
               you couldn't have waited to see
               a psychiatrist.  no, you had...

     alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it
     forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and
     trip the guards into a bellyflop.

     hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them
     into alex's thumbcuffs.  he then limbos under their
     connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer
     cord.  the security guards clumsily turn and re-trip
     themselves.

                             hawk
               let's go down the freight elevator.

     big stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator.

                             alex
               keep those ideas coming.

     hawk and alex run toward an office located at the right
     wall.  they both do a gene-kellyesque-chair-tip-over
     before simultaneously bashing through the office door.
