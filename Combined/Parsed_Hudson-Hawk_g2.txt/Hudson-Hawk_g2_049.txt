     int. outside the codex room--night

     hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to
     the mouth of the doorless codex room.  he pauses to
     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at
     the sides.

     the codex room

     carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, hawk
     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

                             hawk
               "beware the odd steps."

     hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a
     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized
     alarm button.

                             hawk
               why kit kat, aren't you a
               gentleman...

     hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to
     where the codex is bathed in a holy light.

     he hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
     across the top.  the parallel mirrors now face out from
     each other.  hawk sprays a blast of clairol to reveal the
     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

     the light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and hawk
     exhales.  he balances the connected mirrors then crawls
     through his tent-like passageway.

     hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
     the rectangular glass case that holds the codex.  the
     acid sizzles.
