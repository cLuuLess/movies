     int. a little underground subway--day

     a four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
     mini-underground station.  workers latch onto mail bags.
     hawk and anna emerge from a small door.

                             hawk
               whoa, part 2.  does it go to times
               square?

                             anna
               delivers up to ten at night.  the
               pope has an obsession with his
               easter seals.  it's actually not
               that an unusual set-up.  the
               secret passageway on the other
               hand....

                             hawk
               the vatican is made of constant
               mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
               not explained.

                             anna
               nice.  but right out of our
               brochure.

                             hawk
               oh, you read that.

                             anna
               actually i wrote it.  it's a good
               sentence.  it can apply to people.

                             hawk
               you're not an unmysterious thang
               yourself.

                             anna
               i don't steal stuffed elephants
               from little girls.
                       (smoothing his
                        jacket)
               and i buy my own clothes.  my
               life's a little boring...

                             hawk
               god, i wish i could say the same
               thing.  what about having a nice,
               dull dinner with me tonight.
               scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
               anecdotes about famous dead
               italians....

                             anna
               i'll bring my entire repertoire...

     the two flunkies stumble into the station, looking
     around.  anna and hawk crouch down.

                             hawk
               and i'll bring my entourage...

                             anna
               secret passageways don't mean as
               much as they used to.  there's
               a place two blocks east of here.
               enzo's.  say 10:30.

                             hawk
               said.

     hawk and anna peck each other with a smile.  he crawls
     out an exit door.  as he leaves, anna's smile disappears.
     she pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
     bang on the head.  she then darts to a large crucifix
     and looks up.

                             anna
               father, it's obvious.  he's up to
               something.

     suddenly a speaker in jesus's mouth gently crackles.

                             jesus (italian)
               report downstairs at once.

                             anna
               yes, sir.
