     ext. indoor train track

     one of the small vatican mail trains bullets across an
     indoor track.  the viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
     pope, that has hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
     the train zips into a tunnel.
