     ext. the road into hoboken--day

     the caddy thunders past a sweet manhattan view. "come
     fly with me" is playing on the radio.  hawk casually com-
     pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

                             hawk
               that's your definition of "hard?"

                             alex
               show off.  hey, boss tune.  "come
               fly with me."

                             hawk
               three minutes, 51 seconds.

                             alex
               still do the puzzles, still know
               the running times of songs, and
               i'll bet you're still the best
               damn cat burg--

                              hawk
               not anymore.  now i'm the laziest
               damn cat burg--i'm going to take
               it so straight that i won't tape
               a mets game without the expressed
               written consent of the national
               baseball league.

                             alex
               now that you're born again,what
               do you wanna do?  statue of
               liberty?  entertain some ladies?
               miss saigon tix?  seduce some
               women?  play nintendo?  bone some
               chicks?

                             hawk
               come on, alex, let's just get to
               alex's.  your bar's the only
               place that's going to cheer me.
               god, i'd kill for a damn
               cappuccino.  what the hell's a
               nintendo?

                             alex
               oh man, you still got a thing for
               those unmasculine european coffees?
               who's your buddy?

     alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                             hawk
               the man knows, the man knows!

     hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                             alex
               so mr. coffee, what went down
               outside the prison?

                             hawk
               oh, not much.  mario brothers want
               me to do a job.

     alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  hawk half-heartedly
     tries to lick up with his fingers.

                             alex
               those dago-guinea-i can say
               this shit i'm italian-wop
               motherfu--

                             hawk
               ah, had the perfect amount of
               foam.  just get me to the bar...
               it's the one good thing in my
               life that'll never change....
