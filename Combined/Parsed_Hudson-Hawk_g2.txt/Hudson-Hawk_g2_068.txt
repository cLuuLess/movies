     int. outside the confession booth--morning

     the cardinal emerges and stands by anna's confessional
     curtains.

                             cardinal
               so let me get this straight,
               sister, you're saying hudson hawk
               is not willingly working for the
               mayflowers but kaplan and the
               candy bars are?

     anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
     full nun habit for she is a nun.  the gaspingly beautiful
     church unfolds as they walk.

                             anna
               you got it.  operation deflower
               mayflower is a bad joke and i'm the
               punchline.  i thought we were using
               the cia to help us to get mayflower,
               but really the cia was using me to
               keep us away from mayflower.

                             cardinal
               oh, why couldn't i be the cardinal
               in charge of catering.... if the
               mayflowers get the three sections
               of da vinci's crystal and his
               instructions for the gold machine--
               aie-yi--do we got anything?  what of
               alex, hawk's friend, where is his
               loyalty?

                             anna
               i'm going to find out.

                             cardinal
               i'm sorry for losing it back there,
               but you must remember, sister, you
               have vows to god as well as a mission
               to the world.

                             anna
               i know, i know, your eminence, just say
               "god go with me."

                             cardinal
               god go with you, sister.

     anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously
     contrasting with her habit.  she moves off....
