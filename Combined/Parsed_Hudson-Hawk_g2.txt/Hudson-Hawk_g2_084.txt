     int. dark room atop mayflower museum--day

     a damaged hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles
     to some shutters.  "o solo mio" returns on the sound-
     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of vinci.

     hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  a
     slightly more composed anna touches his shoulder causing
     him to jump slightly.  they melt into a kiss.

                             anna
               oh hudson...

                             hawk
               i told you not to call me hudson.
               the only people who called me that
               were the nuns at...

                             anna
               oh hudson, i'm a sister of the
               catholic church as well as an
               agent.

                             hawk
                       (cut-off laugh)
               this is too bad to be false.

     alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a
     bandage around his neck.  his voice is strange, but still
     polite.

                             alfred
               welcome back to vinci.

                             hawk
               last rites, sister?

                             anna
               please, no nun jokes...they're a
               bad habit to get into....get it?

     hawk and anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.

                              hawk
               she killed alex.

     alfred gives them a push.
