     int. anna's place

     foam shoots out over the coffee.  hawk smiles down at
     it as anna works a cappuccino machine.

                             anna
               for two years, i've been tracking
               the mayflowers' peculiar interest
               in three da vinci pieces.  their
               sforza replica was as fake as
               the "gas leak" that supposedly
               destroyed it.

                             hawk
               does everyone in the world know
               more than me?  jesus, i'm just
               some guy who happens to be good
               at swiping stuff.....lifted a
               piece of licorice when i was one
               and a half.  who knew it would
               lead... they even got the cia
               involved!

                             anna
               the c.i. what?  god, no...

                             hawk
                       (raising his cup)
               ooh, i guess i do know something
               here's looking at you, kid...

     the car outside

     the agents burst from the car, guns raised.

                             almond joy
               now.

     anna's house

     hawk sips the cappuccino.  his face immediately contracts.

                             hawk
               this doesn't taste like
               cappuccino.

                             anna
               oh, i must have put too much
               ethyl-chloride in it.

     anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her
     hand.  hawk collapses.  his coffee cup lands perfectly in
     anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly
     on the pillow.

     the candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.

                             anna
               why didn't you tell me at the
               restaurant that he had hit the
               vatican tonight.  my people will
               not be happy.  i want to see kaplan.

                             almond joy
               that's not overly possible.  he...

                             butterfinger
               but guys, remember, he's in the
               castle at vinci....

     snickers and almond joy grimace into fake smiles.
