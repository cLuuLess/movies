     int./ext. circular open air hallway

     hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  he
     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
     sees a line of international phone boothettes.  checking
     for flunkies, he rips one up.

               call to alex messina, new york....

     the flunkies drift into view.  hawk hangs up and seethes
     off.
