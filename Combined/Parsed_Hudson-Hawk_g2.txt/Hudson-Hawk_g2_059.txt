     ext. a car outside of anna's place--night

     crammed together in the front seat, snickers, almond
     joy, and butterfinger are watching the shadows of
     hawk and anna up in the window.  snickers snaps a
     cartridge into a gun while butterfinger attacks a
     goo-ey pastry.

                              snickers
               what's going on in there?

                              butterfinger
               do you want me to rape them?
                       (throwing pastry down)
               dunkin does it better.

                              snickers
               just read, butterfinger.

     butterfinger pulls up the book on da vinci that anna
     wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                             butterfinger
               "da vinci had fears about his
               more dangerous designs, so he
               created a shorthand code in
               reverse script..."

                             almond joy
               to yourself!.....what are they
               doing?  in twenty seconds, we go
               in.
