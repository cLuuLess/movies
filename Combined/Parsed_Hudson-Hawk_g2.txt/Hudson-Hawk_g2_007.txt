     int. prison cell wall

     a hand tears down a picture of a happy hudson hawk and
     a little monkey, identically dressed in black cat
     burglar gear.

     the block

     the wise guard and the young guard rumble forward.

                             wise guard
               as a thief, hawk was a poem.
               iambic fucking pentameter.  you
               know, crime used to have a little
               class.  a hundred reporters were
               here when he came in, now they're
               probably out covering some tired
               crack gang war...

     the guards approach hawk's cell.  hawk, with his back
     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.

                             hawk
               remind me to fire my publicist.

     the wise guard chuckles as the young guard fumbles with
     his key-ring.

                             young guard
               darn, these are for l-block...

     hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe
     cleaner from the wise guard's pocket.  then the lighter
     from the young guard's pocket--burns off the fabric fuzz
     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened
     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to
     unlock the door.

                             young guard
               - go back down to security and-

     he stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  the
     guards double-take as hawk, finally in full view, struts
     past them, down the hall.  the guards hustle to catch
     up.  the wise guard puts his finger in the air and
     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating
     from hawk.

                             wise guard
               guess this means, hawk, you'll
               be able to let yourself back in...

                             hawk
               never happen.  bet.  ten bucks.

     hawk and the wise guard hit fists, half-smiling.  hawk
     unfolds the painting.

                             hawk
               oh, give this back to petey in a
               block.  tell him it was a sweet
               gift, but i think he got some
               wrong ideas about our friendship.

                             young guard
               the paint thinner killer did
               this?  i think you picked a good
               day to get out...

     the trio comes to the final checkpoint.  hawk takes a
     deep breath.

                             wise guard
               hope i lose the bet.  have that
               cappuccino on me.

                             hawk
                       (flipping him the
                        pipe cleaner)
               you got it.  a double.
