     ext. right into a cafe chair--night

     panting and discombobulated, hawk looks across the table
     to the female hands holding open a menu.  the menu comes
     down.  it is anna.  hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
     bag.

                             anna
               oh hudson, i was worried you
               weren't going to drop by....

                             hawk
               i never break a date.  scout's
               honor.

     hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
     then quickly rips it off as a waiter comes to the
     table.

                             hawk
               fettucini con funghi porcini.

                             waiter
               bellissimo, signor.

                             hawk
               oh, and could i have some ketchup
               with that.

     anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  other
     table occupants sadly shake their heads.
