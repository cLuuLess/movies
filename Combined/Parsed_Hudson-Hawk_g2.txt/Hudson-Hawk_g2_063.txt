     int. a mysterious dark room--night

     a sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing
     kaplan.

     snickers and butterfinger flop hawk onto the lit chair.

     kit kat is dressed exactly like anna.  she reacts as she
     comes into the light.  kaplan takes the codex from her.

                             kaplan
               way to go, anna.

                             anna
               when the mayflowers find out we
               have the codex, they're going to
               want to make a deal...

                             kaplan
                       (gung-ho lying)
               and then we'll arrest those
               greedy pigs... is that it?

     hawk stirs.  the viewer gets his woozy p.o.v.

                             anna
               actually george, it's not it.
               what are we doing in this castle?
               i happen to know the mayflowers
               bought this castle last year when
               they found out da vinci used to
               do...

     the lights in the room come on to the sound of holy da
     vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of
     the exact same workshop da vinci toiled in in the
     opening.

                             kaplan
                       (trying to be solemn)
               it's the site of their new museum
               and we're taking it over.  operation
               deflower mayflower is going full
               speed ahead.

                             anna
                       (taking it in)
               oh lord.... the only reason i ask is
               that hudson, uh, mr. hawk, hawkins,
               had some "neat" things to say about
               darwin, minerva, and you.
               basically that you're part of the
               same car pool.

                             kaplan
               anna.  anna.  anna.  if that were
               true, almond joy would have
               handed you your heart right
               after you handed me the codex.
               now, get some sleep.  kit kat...

     kit kat in drag spookily moves inches away from anna.

                              anna
               cat got his tongue?

                              kaplan
               actually he never told us what it
               was.

     kit kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

                             anna
               how sweet.  i trust you will see
               hudson hawk is given to the proper
               authorities.  i recommend
               leniency...

                             snickers
                       (holding in a laugh)
               oh, i think we all do.

     hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes
     anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking
     kit kat.

                             snickers
               do you think she has any idea that
               operation deflower mayflower is as
               bogus as kit kat's tits?

                             kaplan
               i don't think so, although bringing
               her to the castle gave her a big,
               juicy hint.

                             almond joy
               with all due respect to that great
               blouse, why didn't i cut out her
               heart?

                             kaplan
               close call, but she's our only way
               of keeping tabs on that damn
               mysterious vatican organization.
               hawk, it's time to go to the
               principal's office....
