     int. the conference room--day

     wind blows through the shattered conference room window.
     snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the
     table with the mayflowers and the other agents.

                             kaplan
               we're all family now.  my team
               has done a lot of rougher things
               than steal the model of a
               helicopter.

                             snickers
               we're going to whack this place
               so fast we'll have time to shop
               for american imports.

     darwin and minerva politely smile and then turn away to
     each other with knowing looks.  the computer screen shows
     the familiar image of the kremlin building that turns
     into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later
     see.

                             almond joy
               lucky for us, the da vinci is
               located in a wing of the kremlin
               that they used to throw the miss
               ukraine pageant and stuff.  it'll
               have the least number of guards....

                             kaplan
               as for our plan of action,
               anybody'd be insane to go in
               from the ground floor...
