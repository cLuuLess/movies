     int. gates apartment--late night

     hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes gates and his
     pad more grotesque than they are (no small feat.)
     a sub-radio shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch
     bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the
     instantly recognizable framed picture of those dogs
     playing poker, all atop a jungle shag.

     gates, in shorts and a hawaiian shirt-over-a-keep on
     truckin'-t-shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand,
     the black canvas bag in the other.

                             gates
               hudson hawkins gets the chair of
               honor.  how about a gates-arita?
                       (toward bowl)
               i used real hot dogs.

                             hawk
               weren't you the bartender at
               jonestown?

     suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a
     seated cesar and antony mario, the latter taking a painful
     gatesirita sip.

                             cesar
               good job, not pretty, but good.

                             hawk
               ah, the mafia, the cops; do i know
               how to party or what?

     gates pulls out the horse and looks at it.

                             gates
               all this trouble for a horsey.
               i may not know art, but i know
               what i like.

                             hawk
                       (to dog picture)
               you certainly do.

                             gates
               so when's that sebastian-cabot-
               buckingham-palace-looking-
               butlerhead getting here?

                             alfred
               any minute now, dear mr. gates.

     a malevolently snobbish british butler, alfred, enters in
     distaste.  he makes a stressful glance to three vanity
     fairs on a coffeetable that has a photo of a magnetic
     husband-wife-dog combo with the caption: mayflower power.
     hawk notices this.

                             gates
               oh, sorry jeeves.  gates-arita?

                             alfred
               i'll pass.  may i?

     alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's
     loupe, studies it carefully.

                             alfred
               ah, such craftsmanship.  leonardo
               da vinci's last commission for the
               duke of milan.  irreplaceable.

                             gates
               hey, mr. french, i'm delirious
               for you.  now where's my cut?

     with dignity, alfred smashes the ancient horse over
     gates's head.  alfred rummages through the debris
     revealing a perversely labyrinthine crystal piece.
     (recognizable from da vinci's workshop).

                             gates
               you son-of-a......i don't believe
               this!  you come into my house!

     alfred pockets the goodies, but not before hawk can give
     them a confused peruse.

                             gates
               i ought to take big ben and shove
               it up your limey blimey bunghole!

     a blade slides down alfred's arm.  half-yawning, he...

     alfred's 180 degree pov

     spins before gates and the bystanders behind him.
     the blade goes back up alfred's arm.

     the room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate
     music.  gates shrugs but his voice is off.

                             gates
               like i said.  where's my cu-u-...

     suddenly a line across gates's neck turns red and blood
     begins to gush like a tourist attraction.  gates crashes
     down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
     sending it to the ground, cutting off the music.  the dog
     poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

     blown away, hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
     recliner.  alfred pats some stain remover on the blood
     on his shirt.

                             alfred
               so much for his "cut."
                       (post-chortle)
               excuse my dry british humor.

                             cesar
                       (rising)
               lovely work, alfred, taking the
               concorde back?

                             alfred
               indeed i am, mr. mario.  i'm
               really racking up those frequent
               flyer points...

                             hawk
               i hate to interrrupt you two
               lovebirds...

                             antony
               you know, i think gates promised
               hawk a cut, too....

     the mario brothers cackle out.  hawk tries to flail out
     of his chair.  alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm.
     hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes
     alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair.

                             alfred
               ta ta, hudson hawk.

                             hawk
                       (breathless)
               too-do-loo, babe.
