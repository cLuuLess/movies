     int. alex's restaurant--dawn

     hawk bursts into the bar.  alex sits on a stool, reading
     the paper.

                             alex
               did i miss anything?

                             hawk
               oh, not much.  gates just had his
               tonsils taken out.  the hard way.
         
                             alex
               geez, gates was killed.  who do we
               send the thank you note to?
         
     hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle
     with the cappuccino machine.

                             hawk
               the butler did it.  guy was a cross
               between alistair cook and a cuisinart.
               dude took mr. ed and humptied
               dumptied it over gates's head.  he
               said it was made by, get this,
               leonardo..

                             alex
                       (professorial)
               ah yes, a rare renaissance piece.
               da vinci's "sforza," an equestrian
               model of a never executed statue.
               i consider it to be the prize of
               tonight's auction of objets
               d'equestrian.  horse things.

     the cappuccino machine sparks.  a perplexed hawk takes
     a couple extra seconds to back off.

                             hawk
               okay, you got me, mr. pbs.

                             alex
                       (holding up newspaper)
               morning edition.  seems two thieves
               "attempted" to steal it last night,
               but thanks to three "courageous"
               guards, it will be ready for tonight.

                             hawk
               "attempted."  at-tempt-ted!  i'm
               not happy about having to steal
               that horse, but i do have my
               pride.  face it, when it comes to
               burglary, and sex, i....

     hawk takes the newspaper.  there is a picture of the
     three security guards in a cheery pose behind the
     "sforza."  hawk squints to see that security guards one
     and two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                             hawk
               boing.  uh, this i don t understand...

                             alex
               why try?

                             hawk
                       (hurdling the bar)
               because i'm tired of not
               understanding things.  cops,
               mafia, and butlers forcing me to
               bust my ass to steal something,
               which it turns out i really didn't
               steal--it's fucked up.

                             alex
                       (pulling back newspaper)
               you re not thinking of going to...

                             hawk
               alex, my man, it's time to play a
               little offense.  where's your tux?
