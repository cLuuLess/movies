     ext. vinci countryside - renaissance - day

     beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
     renaissance fair with florid awnings, demented acrobats
     and roaring puppets is unfolding.

     rustic farmers and their families rumble with enjoyment
     at the sabbath afternoon entertainment.

     encircled by children, a juggler with an unforgettably
     etched face elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
     on his mule.  as he begins to juggle, a loud explosion
     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
     and collapse in a heap.

     everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.

                             unforgettable juggler
               leonardo, che pazzo.

     the juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...
