     int. the room of the gold machine--day

     alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that da
     vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created
     piece by piece.  in the periphery, the 90's rears its
     head in the form of three technicians wearing headsets
     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.

                              minerva (o.s.)
               gold-fi-ing-er!

     hawk and anna turn to see minerva splashily enter in
     sexy funeral-wear.

                              minerva
               sorry, i couldn't resist.  you're
               probably wondering why you're
               still alive.  anna.....

     as minerva speaks, technician one forcibly escorts anna
     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly
     handcuffs her to it.

                              minerva
               i want you to monitor the da
               vinci's directions from the
               apprentice diary.  and hawk, i
               didn't want you to go to hell
               without knowing that darwin and
               i's dream came true.
                       (suddenly sheepish)
               beside that, none of us can seem
               to put that damn crystal together.
               alfie and i were up all night with
               the thing.

     technician two commences a forcible escort of hawk to the
     gold machine.  hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.

                              hawk
               you killed a friend.  why should i
               help you go for the gold?

                              minerva
               it'll take a couple of years of
               steady production, but i'll flood
               the market with so much gold that
               gold itself, the foundation of all
               finance, will lose its meaning.
               brokers, economists, and fellow
               entrepreneurs will drown in the
               saliva of their own nervous
               breakdowns.  markets will crash-
               crash.  financial empires will
               crumble-crumble.

                              hawk
               except yours-yours.  the goal of
               world domination.  well, if you
               put it that way, minnie.  how can
               i resist?

                              minerva
               you can't, convict!  you're just
               a shmoe!  every shmoe has the
               fantasy the planet revolves around
               them.  it rains, car crash stops
               traffic, you say "how could this
               happen to me?"  it's a natural
               inclination.  but for i, this
               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!
               you are on my planet!  you walk
               around the corner for coffee, out
               of my sight, you do not fucking
               exist!  the lives of shmoes like
               you have meaning only in relation
               to the rich, to the powerful, to me!

     anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  she pulls
     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror
     over the scribblings.  reading off the reflection, her
     eyes widen.

                              anna
               do it.  there's no reason to fight
               anymore.  she's a force of nature.

     trying to get a grip on anna's words, hawk lets himself
     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that
     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.

                              minerva
               if you pull this off, i can't
               promise i won't kill you.  i mean,
               who we trying to kid?  but i will
               spare the flying nun here....

                              hawk
               and to think i thought you were
               evil incarnate in pumps.

                              minerva
               i killed some lovable working
               class italian-diabetic, but you
               killed the most significant male
               figure of the decade and a kind,
               gentle lover.  so don't play with
               me.

     minerva flicks a switch on the stand anna's handcuffed
     to.  anna vibrates, being electrocuted.

                              hawk
               okay, fine!

     minerva switches it off.  giving himself a head rub, hawk
     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  he
     tangles and bends and with a loud snap, puts them
     together, forming the crystal from the opening scene.
     minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.

                              minerva
               oh hawk, don't ever change.  go,
               team, go!

     minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as da
     vinci had it in his machine.

     using a long steel pole, technician one adjusts a myriad
     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series
     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.

     technicians two (black-eyed) and three pour various
     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-
     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the
     chemical's zodiac sign.

     alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.

     hawk glides to anna and undoes her handcuff.

                              hawk
               i hope you know what....

                              anna
               trust leonardo....

                              hawk
               wha.....

     anna puts her fingers on his lips.

     minerva throws a lever.  steam begins to percolate from
     the furnace towards the machine.

                              minerva
                       (into the headset)
               we're for real.

     the machine

     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.
     the crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.

     the machine throws out its folding arms, each with an
     element.  the arms click higher.

     the goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video
     monitor, taking notes.

     the chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to
     spill and drop through brass tubes.

     anna

     murmurs to hawk.

                              anna
               da vinci made the real directions
               in a secret script that i decoded.
               the way the machine is running
               now, the gold will produce too
               quickly, clog, and the machine
               will shut itself down.  isn't it
               wonderful?

                              hawk
               yeah, but what would happen if that
               little mirror came out of the
               crystal.

                              anna
               wha -- you don't want to know...

     hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.

                              hawk
               i wanna know...

                              anna
               holy sh-h--things are going to
               get very interesting, very fast.
               da vinci would be proud of you.

     in the machine

     the chemicals snake down their individual paths to the
     lead bar spinning its trough.  there's a flash and a
     controlled but jarring explosion.

     everyone

     doubletakes.  hawk reaches down to the six foot steel
     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three
     deep in concentration technicians to the ground.

     oblivious to the violence behind her, minerva, pulling
     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a
     religious purr.

     the machine

     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around
     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.

     outside the machine

     hawk and anna squint, blinded.  flinging off her goggles,
     a literally beaming minerva giggles forward.

     the machine

     beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into
     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!

     minerva

     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and
     molten.  she moves closer, shouting into her head-set.

                              minerva
               eureka, motherfuckers!

     the machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive
     pace.

     hawk's voice suddenly comes on minerva's head-set.

                              hawk's voice (head-set)
               minnie, hate to interrupt your
               orgasm, but....

     hawk and anna

     stand above the unconscious technicians.  hawk is on
     head-set.

                              hawk
               me, anna, and leonardo just wanna
               say you got the midas touch, baby...

     machine

     minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.

     the center of the machine blows.  the pool of molten gold
     rockets at the viewer.

     mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.

     minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
     face.  it bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
     bizarrely beautiful echo of nefertiti.

     hawk and anna

     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing indian war
     paint on his face and the words rule britannia painted
     on his chest, alfred!

                              alfred
               how.

                              hawk
               you're unemployed, alfie.  boss
               is dead.  her plan is over.

                              alfred
                       (strange voiced)
               my plan is just beginning.  i'll
               forgive you for denying me the
               pleasure of slaughtering my
               boorish employers, but i'm afraid
               the birth of the new british
               empire can have no witnesses!

                              hawk
               ooh-kay...

     alfred rushes forward with a howl.  hawk meets him
     halfway.  they trade savage punches and then lock onto
     each other's throats.

     anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
     for forgiveness.  she aims steadily, and fires...

     right into hawk's arm.  this allows alfred to knock him
     back with a strong punch.

                              anna
               sorry!

     she fires again.  the bullet pings off hawk's belt buckle.

                              hawk
               stop helping me!  thou shalt not
               kill!

     hawk's turning to chastize anna, allows alfred to kick
     hawk back against a wall.  alfred lunges out with his
     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  hawk yanks the shaft.
     alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on hawk's
     throat.

     gasping, hawk looks to a rip in alfred's shirt and sees
     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  with an all or nothing
     jerk, hawk flicks the lever.  the shaft clicks on the
     hinge.

     alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
     away from hawk and suddenly it is alfred's throat which
     is caught in the v-shaped trap!  the momentum of the
     sudden change makes alfred stumble towards the wall until
     the point of the "v" hits it--

                              hawk
               don't lose your head over this.

     hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a babe ruth
     swing right onto the v.  the blades slam together and
     pop alfred's head off, sending it screaming disembodied,
     high in the air.

     alfred's screaming head p.o.v.

     hawk and anna are seen waving up to the viewer (alfie's
     head).

                              hawk
               excuse my crass american humor.

     the machine thunders with another explosion.

     the da vinci workshop

     hawk and anna rush into the da vinci workshop.  she
     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  he
     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he
     sees...

     bunny the dog!! standing in the open mouth of the
     workshop.  anna turns to hawk...

                              anna
               allow me.

     anna confidently moves toward the dog until bunny leaps
     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
     her crashing to the ground.

     hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.

     bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
     anna, blood gently starts to emerge.

     hawk can't get off a shot.  he throws down the gun in
     exasperation.  it lands next to the gadget that is
     connected to the tennis ball machine.  hawk rushes
     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to ten, and
     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.

                              hawk
               oh bunny, ball-ball.

     bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up
     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.

     hawk slams down on the gadget.

     a tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.

     bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
     of it sends him flying and crashing out a window.

     hawk pulls up anna as the machine completely explodes.

     a huge chunk of the roof thuds before the workshop door.

     hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  anna shakes
     her head vigorously.  he pulls her out of the frame.
