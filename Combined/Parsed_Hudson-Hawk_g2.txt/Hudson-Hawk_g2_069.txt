     int. rome conference room--day

     beneath the wacky portrait, darwin circles the board-
     member filled conference table as minerva smooches bunny.
     everyone watches alfred place a bar of gold and of lead
     in the hands of a blindfolded hawk at the middle of the m.

                             darwin
               so, captain hawk, in one of your
               paws you got a gold bar worth
               about 8 thou.  in the autre, you
               got lead that won't get you
               gelato.

                             minerva
               surely a master-thief like you can
               tell the difference.

                             hawk
                       ("what's my line")
               that's two down to kitty
               carlisle...

     hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
     fingernails.  he rips off the blindfold in subdued
     frustration.  as minerva speaks, she unconsciously
     molests alfred.

                             minerva
               cool, isn't it?  weight, feel,
               mal1eability, they're all but
               identical.  on the periodic chart
               of elements, they're but one
               proton apart.  great minds worked
               for centuries to turn worthless
               into priceless.

                             hawk
               alchemy.

                             darwin
                       (casually goosing alfred)
               alchemy!  is the business term of
               the 90's, my man!  minerva read
               about it in an airline magazine
               about four years ago.  i dumped
               some lira into research... shazam,
               we come across a diary by one of
               da vinci's apprentices detailing
               la machine de oro, the gold machine
               for those at home, and the rest is
               about to become history.  money
               isn't everything, gold is.  fuck
               blue chip stocks!  fuck t-bills!
               fuck junk bonds!  i got the real
               deal!  money will always be paper
               but gold will always be gold!

                             minerva
               market crashes.  bomb drops.
               greenhouse effect affects.  we'll
               still be the richest, most powerful
               people in the world.  in 1992,
               europe is coming together to become
               one business superpower.  it's one
               party we'd love to poop.

                             darwin
               well, that said, the last
               ingredient in the recipe is in, get
               this, you're gonna die, the kremlin.

                              hawk
               sure.  the kremlin.  makes sense.
               the kremlin.  why not?  listen,
               this is all too indiana jones and
               the lost city of king tut for me,
               man.  throw me in jail and go ahead,
               just try and throw alex...

                             minerva
               jail, you asshole!  our foot
               soldiers will blow your brains
               out!  bunny, ball-ball!

     minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
     tennis ball into its mouth.

                             darwin
               i'll torture you so slowly you'll
               think it's a career!  i'll kill
               your family, your friends, and the
               bitch you took to the prom!

                             hawk
               you want an address on that last
               one?

     bunny barks up at hawk in anger.

                             hawk
               bunny, not you too?

                              minerva
               you've got a dilemma, tiger.  i
               think i know what's going to help
               you solve it.

     alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
     and the blindfold.  the viewer's viewpoint stays on a
     writhing hawk.

                              hawk
               i'll kill all you.  even the old
               lady.


     hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
     then picks the lock with his teeth.  hawk rips off the
     blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
     for alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
     italian leather coat.

                             alex
               i hated cigarettes until i saw my
               first no smoking sign.  keep off
               the grass?  let's play soccer.
               only law i cared about was
               friendship.  broke that one too,
               didn't i?  this gates-mario
               brothers-cia-mayflower-da vinci
               thing seemed like a sweet deal.
               visit foreign lands, take their
               treasures.  i don't know, i thought
               you'd get into it.  it's better
               than playing darts with m.b.a.'s at
               the bar.  i didn't know it was
               going to be like this.  them using
               me to use you... i'm sorry, there's
               only one way out of this and it's
               gonna hurt me more than it's gonna
               hurt you.

     alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.
