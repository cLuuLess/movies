     ext. outside the prison--day

     hawk strides to the massive sliding concrete door/wall
     between him and freedom.  as music crescendos and
     hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
     mafioso brothers, cesar and antony mario, the latter
     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window lincoln
     continental.  cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.

                             antony
               welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
               we've got a proposition...

                              hawk
               answer's no, not even if you
               bathe.  cesar mario, antony mario,
               how's the "family?"  kill any
               monkeys lately?

                              cesar
               how many times do i have to say
               it?  i didn't put the hit on
               little eddie... never had anything
               against that kooky chimp.  i
               actually found him, "endearing."

                             hawk
               sure.  face down.  two endearing
               shots to the back of the head.
               that's your mark, man.  what did
               little eddie ever do to...

     smouldering, hawk struts off.  cesar takes a black
     canvas bag from a scarfaced driver and hustles up to
     hawk.  the lincoln rumbles behind them, antony riding
     on the hood.

                             cesar
               you're hitting rutherford's
               auction house.  easy as my
               brother's wife.  directions are
               in the bag.  just open the seventh
               floor safe and take out the
               thingie...

                             hawk
               or you cut off my thingie.
               directions even your brother
               would understand.
         
                             antony
                       (defensively)
               yeah, directions even i could
               understand.

     the car squeals to a stop.  antony bounds off.  cesar
     shove-throws the canvas bag into hawk's unwilling
     hands.

                             cesar
               hawk, you're a great thief.  got
               set up, did some time, nothing to
               be ashamed of.  don't give me a
               sonata about you always just
               really wanted to settle down,
               open a hardware store and sell
               spatulas...

                             hawk
               if the mario brothers weren't
               jersey's third largest family,
               i'd say kiss my ass.  but
               considering your status, i'll
               say slurp my butt.

     hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
     cesar's hands.

                             cesar
               what's your favorite sport, hawk?

                             hawk
               baseball, why?

     antony opens the back door of the lincoln and says
     "baseball."  he is handed a baseball bat.  hawk backs
     up as antony moves threateningly toward him.

                             hawk
               i meant, ping pong.  listen, i'd
               rather go back in than whore for
               you...
                       (stopping)
               oh, i need to borrow ten dollars.

     a prison guard from above turns as not to be a witness.
     hawk feebly calls up to him.

                             hawk
               help?  police?

     antony swings at hawk, who pretends not to notice until
     the last second.  hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
     antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  hawk boots
     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
     it across antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
     of the car.

                             cesar
                       (unfazed)
               you need some time to think.
               that's cool, but next time, i'm
               not going to say "please."

     cesar floats into the backseat.  the lincoln takes off.
     hawk seethes...

                             hawk
               i don't believe this.  i've been
               out forty seconds...

     a backfire rings out.  hawk hits the ground, thinking
     it is a gunshot.

     hawk's on the ground p.o.v.

     a gasping 1960 caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  hawk looks up to
     see alex messina, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
     friend.

                             alex
               that's the first thing i did.
               smooch the ground and taste the
               freedom.  sorry i was late.  miss
               anything?

                             hawk
                       (getting up)
               your timing, and your shoes, are
               impeccable...  good to see you,
               alex, been having a lousy day.

                             alex
               lousy day?  the man's getting out
               of prison and he's having a
               lousy day.  what, you missing out
               on the cell block water ballet
               pageant?  believe me, it's
               overrated.

     hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs alex.

                             alex
               where's the kiss?  no tongue this
               time, i promise.

     a laughing hawk gives alex's stomach a slap before
     getting in the car....

                             hawk
               looks like you've been expanding
               your...

                             alex
               don't say it, hawkins.  i'm
               incredibly sensitive about my
               fucking figure.

                             hawk
               my next word was gonna be
               "consciousness."  swear to god...
               tubby.
