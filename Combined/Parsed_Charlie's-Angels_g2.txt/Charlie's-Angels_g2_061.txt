int. charles townsend detective agency - (the next) day

charlie is on the speakerphone.      the angels are in their
usual lounging positions.

                           charlie's voice
             good work, angels. not only did you
             save knox, you saved his company as well.

                           dylan
             i think that earns us a vacation.

                           natalie
             say, fiji?

                                                  (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 43.

                           alex
                    (to natalie)
             any special guy you were thinking
             of inviting?

natalie grins a guilty smile.

                              charlie's voice
             sorry, angels.     our work is only
             half-done.

knox enters. clean-shaven and neatly pressed, he's still a
darn good-looking man. vivian wu follows him.

                           charlie's voice (cont'd)
             meet your new client, eric knox.

                           knox
             first off, thank you. you rescued
             me, for which i am eternally grateful.

he's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall
most upon dylan. she notices it.

                           knox (cont'd)
             but there's still a problem. whoever
             kidnapped me wasn't just trying to
             screw up our ipo. they also stole
             the proprietary software for our new
             web browser. i'm sure it was roger
             corwin, but i need proof.

                           charlie's voice
             that's where you come in, angels.

circling around, we see the video images of corwin and the
red star systems logo on the big screen.

                           charlie's voice (cont'd)
             we need to break into red star's computer
             systems to see if mr. knox's software is
             indeed being converted for red star's use.

                           natalie
             sounds like a plan.

                           charlie's voice
             not as easy as that, natalie. red
             star's headquarters are as tightly
             guarded as a military facility.
             we're going to need reconnaissance
             on their mainframe computer system,
             and the best way to get that is
             through mr. corwin himself.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 44.

continued:

a video image of corwin's palm pilot schedule comes up the
bigscreen. the shot pulls in close on "san diego speedway."

                           charlie's voice (cont'd)
             we need to pin a camera on him to get
             footage of the inside of the building.
             thanks to alex's work at the health spa,
             we know that corwin will be at the san
             diego speedway on thursday. get close to
             him angels, but don't tip your hand.

                           alex
             consider it done.

                           charlie's voice
             dylan, i need you to arrange for mr.
             knox's security. i'd hate to have him
             kidnapped again.

                           dylan
             absolutely. but we'd all feel safer
             if you could join us, charlie.

                                                cut to:

underwater

from charlie's p.o.v., looking up at the sunlight.      three
manta-rays swim above us.

we can hear the bubbles from charlie's regulator.

                           charlie
             i'd love to angels. but i'm in a
             bit over my head at the moment.

a manta-ray swims past, super-close, letting us...

                                                wipe to:
