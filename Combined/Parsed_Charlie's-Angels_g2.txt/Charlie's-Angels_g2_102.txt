int. knox's house - night

dylan and knox are asleep in his bed, when the doorbell
chimes. dylan bolts upright. she slips out of bed, peers
out the window. vivian wu is waiting by the front door.

                           dylan
             eric, it's vivian.

                             knox
             hmmm.    i wonder what she's here
             for?

                           dylan
             want me to tell her to come back, or...

                           knox
             no, no.  i'd better deal.
                    (he kisses her)
             you go back to bed.

knox pulls on a robe, goes downstairs.

stay on dylan --

as she pulls on her clothes, her cell phone rings.     she
grabs it.

                             dylan
             hello?

             who she says she is. she's a former
             assassin and an all around bitch.

                            dylan
             oh no.   oh shit. natalie, she's here!
