int. miami arena - night

we reverse angle to reveal the inside of miami arena. the first
thing that hits us is the wall of sound, the noise made
by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy.

the next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the
job facing the angels. hard to spot? the crowd is one,
enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity.

                              dylan
             aw, shit.

the game is in progress, duke vs. north carolina, and it's a
barn burner. a one point game with six minutes to go. ball
player pulls up and swishes a three pointer, duke by two.
the crowd goes apeshit.

by the mezzanine

the angels huddle, yelling over the deafening noise of the
crowd...

                           dylan (cont'd)
             we have to split up!
                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               92.

continued:

                           alex
             i'll take the luxury boxes.

                           dylan
             i'll take the mezzanine.

                           natalie
             i got the floor.

they split up. dylan leads the charge down the loge section,
blowing past the security woman, who yells after her.
