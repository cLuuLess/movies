int. hallway

jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for alex. he
finds her on her walkie talkie, the thin man handcuffed
to the staircase.

                            alex
             hi, jason.   gimme one second?

jason nods, sure.

we go to another triptych, all three angels on their cell
phones in different parts of arena.

                           alex (cont'd)
             angels! knox planted the bomb in the
             basement, and it's timed to go off
             when the game clock hits zero!

                           natalie (o.s.)
             roger that, alex, i'll stop the clock!

                           dylan (o.s.)
             i'll look for the bomb!

alex turns back to jason. he's clearly having a difficult
time processing everything he's just seen.

                           alex
             i lied to you jason.    i'm not a
             secretary.

                           jason
             yeah, i can see that.

                           alex
                    (referring to the
                     thin man)
             and that wasn't charlie.

                            jason
             right.

                           alex
             i'm actually here to stop a madman
             from killing everyone in this
             building. would it be okay if we
             talked later?
                                                  (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 97.

continued:

                           jason
             go save the world, honey.
                    (beat)
             i'll be waiting for you.

alex smiles.    runs off.
