ext. jason's airstream - day

jason stands in the doorway in his robe as alex tosses
her stuff in the back of a very excellent car.

                           jason
             so when you coming back?

                            alex
             not sure.   whenever i can.      i'll
             call you.

                           jason
             oh, great, that's helpful.
                    (watching her prepare to go)
             i don't get it, what kind of
             executive assistant is on 24 hour call?

                           alex
             a very good one.

                           jason
             you ask me, your boss is an asshole.
                    (beat)
             when do i get to meet this charlie
             guy, anyway?
                                                 (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  12.

continued:

                           alex
             charlie's not very social.

                           jason
             yeah, well i think you should
             quit.

                           alex
             charlie needs me.

                            jason
             i need you.

alex looks back -- that was more personally revealing
than she expected.

a p.a. comes up next to jason.

                            p.a.
             mr. gibbons?   we're ready for you
             on the set.

jason nods, then back to alex.

                           jason
             i gotta go save the world.

alex smiles at the irony of that.

                            alex
             my hero.

she blows him a kiss and speeds off.
