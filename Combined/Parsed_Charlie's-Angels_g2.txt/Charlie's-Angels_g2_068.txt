ext. san diego speedway - day

with a roar, another blur of racers whips past, with heat
and noise and speed. the lead car bears the familiar
markings of red star industries. roger corwin is at the
wheel, steering calmly to a comfortable lead, when he is
suddenly bumped.

                              corwin
             what the...?

                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                  49.

continued:

another bump sends him screeching to the left. he almost
crashes, then gets back on course, just as he's passed by...

a sleek, black car, sponsored by the sony corporation, and
manned by a mysterious driver with texas tornado inscripted on
the helmet. we follow the black car as it pulls into the pit.
