ext. bobsled run - night`

the front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed.

it hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along
the wall. it tips further, and further, finally rolling
over onto its back. it scrapes across the concrete, a
shower of sparks as it slows down.

with nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop.
it smashes into the first jeep, a tangle of steel.

the combined mass continues sliding down the run, like a
jagged pinball in the chute.
