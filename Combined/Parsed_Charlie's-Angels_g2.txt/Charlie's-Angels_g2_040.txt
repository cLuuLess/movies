int. tv room - night

... two more thugs sitting in front the big-screen tv,
watching a college basketball game (duke vs. maryland,
in case you care.) the guards look back, spotting alex
with knox.

that wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the

fifteen other thugs

watching the game with them.

angle on alex.   it's an oh-shit moment.

                                                    (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                   36.

continued:

                             alex
             sorry.    wrong room.
                      (to knox)
             back!    run!

the thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of
them pulling out a firearm.
