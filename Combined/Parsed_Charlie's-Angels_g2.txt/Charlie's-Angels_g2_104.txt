int. knox's living room - night

knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. vivian,
sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. they are
both surprised to see dylan walk into the room.

                           vivian wu
             i see you take your bodyguarding
             services seriously. still, i worry
             that no one is watching the door.

                           dylan
                    (covering)
             oh, i'm watching it.     in fact, i just
             called for back up.

from her bag, vivian pulls a silver 9mm.

                           vivian wu
             all the same, i'm concerned about
             mr. knox's safety.
                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                               71.

continued:

although knox is clueless, it's clear the message vivian
is sending to dylan. she's in control here.

vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.

                           knox
                    (explaining)
             vivian just came over to run through
             some numbers for the ipo.

                           vivian wu
             please, take a seat. i'm almost
             finished.

with a knowing glance at dylan, she goes back to her
phone call.

no alternative, dylan takes a seat beside knox.     both face
vivian, whose hand is very near the gun.

dylan looks at knox as he reads through his papers.    he has no
idea there's anything wrong.

                           vivian wu (cont'd)
                    (on phone)
             really. how disappointing.

vivian gestures to the abandoned scrabble game on the table.
why not play?

                           dylan
             i'm not much for games.

                            vivian wu
             pity.

as knox flips pages in the report, dylan casually begins
pushing scrabble letters around, nothing serious. but she's
managed to spell...

enemy

she gets knox's attention, looks to the word, up to vivian.
knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it.

while vivian continues to talk on the phone, knox sets his
report down. pushes around some letters of his own. the
words finally come out as...

i   know

close on dylan.      what does that mean?

vivian snaps her phone shut.

                                                (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 72.

continued:

                           vivian wu (cont'd)
                    (to knox)
             bad news: the other angels are still
             alive. good news: everything else
             proceeding apace.

dylan stands up.    what the hell is going on?

vivian draws the gun on her.    knox moves over toward
vivian's side.

                           knox
             sorry dylan. i knew this moment
             would come sooner or later. i was
             just hoping for later.

a long beat, dylan trying to wrap her head around this.

                           dylan
             all this time, we thought red star
             was behind this, but it was you.
                    (realizing)
             you faked your kidnapping.

knox taps his nose.    she's got it.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             why?

                           knox
             to gain your trust. and get your
             help.
                    (beat)
             i want you to know, my personal
             attraction to you was a sincere
             and unrelated complication.

                           dylan
             oh, well, in that case i feel a lot
             better about you being a lying pole
             smoker.

dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear knox's
throat out. vivian gestures for dylan to keep stepping back.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             i can't believe i trusted you.

                           knox
             why not? you trust charlie and you've
             never even met him.

dylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony.

                                                   (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                   73.

continued:
                           knox (cont'd)
             and believe me, there's a lot about
             him that you don't know. anyway,
             i'm not going to be an idiot and
             stand here talking when we could do
             something useful, like kill you.
             goodbye, dylan, i'll miss you...

how right he is, because as soon as vivian squeezes the
trigger...

dylan drops to the floor, then rolls.

blam!

the bullet misses dylan and slams into the bulletproof window
causing a spider-web crack to spread. dylan sees her
opportunity and heads right for the window while vivian
pumps off shots.

as she comes to the window, dylan jumps up in the air and
does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the
bullet impacted.

smash!

the bulletproof glass shatters outward, and dylan flies out
the window, onto the ledge.

                            knox (cont'd)
             wow.
                    (to vivian)
             i've never seen you do something
             like that.

                            vivian wu
             oh, shut up.

                                                   cut to:
