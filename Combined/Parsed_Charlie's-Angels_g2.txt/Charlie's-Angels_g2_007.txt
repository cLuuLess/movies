ext. chad's crappy boat - day

blinded by the daylight, dylan emerges from below,
relieved to see the boat is docked. chad follows her
outside, pleading...
                         chad
          c'mon dylan. you + me. it's
          magic.
                                              (continued)

continued:

                           dylan
             it's a mistake. a horrible,
             horrible mistake.

she jumps onto the dock.

                           chad
             then how come we keep getting back
             together? it's fate.

dylan just keeps walking.

                           chad
                    (yelling after)
             is it because i live on a boat?

                                                  whip to:

closeup - man's face

this is jason gibbons, handsome, action-movie stud.       he's
concentrating fiercely.

                           alex (o.s.)
             if you don't defuse this bomb,
             logan, l.a.'s going to be a new
             underwater attraction.

a bead of sweat drops down jason's face.

                           jason
             get off my back, sanchez.   i know
             what i'm doing.

reveal alex, her face right next to his.

                            alex
             which wire?   the red one or the blue one?

                           jason
             marix has a thing for red. red
             cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.

                           alex
             so the red one.

                           jason
             that's why i'm gonna say blue.

he makes a "snip" motion.     they both breathe a sigh of relief.

                           alex
             you saved the world again, logan.

she leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face.

continued:

                              jason
             that's my job.

alex kisses him. it's a damn good kiss.          jason's into
it, but pulls away for a second.

                           jason (cont'd)
             i don't think sanchez would kiss
             me. he's a forty-year-old man.

pull back to reveal...

alex and jason are in a fully macked out airstream,
sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. we
can tell from our surroundings that jason is a big deal
hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away
from home.

she licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.

                           alex
             let's have it rewritten.

as she smiles, a cell phone rings. both alex and jason
reach for their phones. it's hers.

                              alex (cont'd)
             hello?
