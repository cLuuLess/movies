int. tiny houseboat bedroom - day

close on dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly
sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. she hears the
ringing -- where is it coming from? why is it drilling
into her head?

checking the floor, she finds her jeans. digs in the
pocket to find her cell phone. answering...

                            dylan
             hi.
                     (recognizing voice)
             hi.   okay. i'll be right in.

she clicks the phone off, then starts looking around.
where the fuck is she?

from the next room, we hear a male voice singing "my
sharona." she checks under the sheets. oh god. she's
naked. she pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on.
closing her eyes, she prays...

                            dylan (cont'd)
             not him.   not him, not him, not him.

                           the voice
             'morning starfish.

                            dylan
             oh god no.

at the door, skinny shirtless chad holds a skillet of eggs.

                            chad
             hungry?
