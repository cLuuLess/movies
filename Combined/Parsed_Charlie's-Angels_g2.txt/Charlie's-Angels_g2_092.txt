int. parking garage / beverly hills - day

bosley hums "in the navy" to himself as he walks through
a parking garage. he's alone in the echo-y garage, and
everything we know about movies tells us this means trouble.

bweep bweep as his alarm shuts off. just as he's about
to lift the handle, he stops. looks back over his shoulder.

did he hear something? he scans the empty garage.         no
one in sight. must've been his imagination.
