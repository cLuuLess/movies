ext. italian street - night

jason and alex are walking down a beautiful, tree-lined
cobblestone street, holding hands. the buildings and
outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint, vaguely
european town.

             alex, i can't tell you how happy i
             am you came.

                              alex
             me too.

                           jason
             no, i mean, it's weird. it's
             weirding me out how happy i am when
             you're around. am i sick or something?

                              alex
                       (smiling)
             got me.

                           jason
             the only bummer is, i start to
             jones when you're not around.
             what the hell am i gonna do this
             weekend, if you're not with me?

                           alex
             we'll get you some sedatives.
             you'll be fine.

he stops, takes her in his arms. with the moonlight
shining down, it's very romantic. they kiss. then...

                            jason
             hey.   wait a second.   come with me!

                              alex
             come with you?

                           jason
             miami, on the sony jet. i've got
             two tickets to the final four.

                           alex
             jason, i don't...

                           jason
             wait, before you say no, let me just
             say something, okay? i'm sick of how
             little we see each other. i'm sick of
             stealing a day here, or a week there.

                           alex
             it's my job, jason. i can't
             explain it, but i have to be on
             call, all the time, and...

                           jason
             what if i changed all that?
                           (more)

continued:
                           jason (cont'd)
             what if i told you to quit your
             job, and come live with me. what
             i'm saying, alex, is that i want
             you to...

blam!    blam!   gunshots ring out!

                            alex
             gunfire!   get down!

alex, in angels mode, immediately throws him to the
ground and covers him. she feels something wet, looks
down to see jason's chest, covered in blood.

                           alex (cont'd)
             my god, you're hit. you're...

                           jason
             fine.  i'm fine.
                    (he laughs)
             they're squibs, it's fake.   see?

he wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue.     finally
convinced, she almost lets herself laugh.

reveal

that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is
just a set. the gunfire was coming from some effects
guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action
scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the
open loading door.

                           jason (cont'd)
             fake guns, too. they're just
             setting up for the next scene.

he helps her up.

                           alex
             sorry about that, i...

                           jason
                    (smiling)
             god, i loved that. the way you
             yelled and everything? baby, you
             been watching too many movies.
                    (he kisses her on the nose)
             alright, i gotta go reset these.
             don't go anywhere. i want to
             finish this conversation.

as he walks out of the soundstage, alex is left behind,
alone. she cleans herself off, shaking her head at her
own paranoia.

continued:

                            alex
             nice, alex.   real nice.

thipp!

a wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster.     alex looks
at the hole. that's strange.

thip, thip!

two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.

                           alex (cont'd)
             hey, is someone firing more squibs
             or...

suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with
silenced gunfire. it's only alex's instincts that let
her duck in time to avoid being turned into swiss cheese.

she tucks and rolls behind a styrofoam set as...

two gunmen with silenced sniper rifles fan out on the
fake city street.

on alex --

crouched behind a wall.

she looks both ways. if she tries to break for the open
loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to jason.
only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the
way across the building, where there's a fire exit.

taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.

the gunmen

fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going
to machine gun mode. the sound of the gunshots are covered
by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.

alex --

sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams.
she lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the
two-by-fours in half.

the gunmen

move slowly through the fake street set. suddenly, they
hear a creaking sound. they look up to see the whole,
fake building set collapsing!

they dive out of the way, just in time to see alex race
through the fire doors.
