dylan has picked two wires.

                        dylan
          chartreuse and magenta.   this has
          gotta be it.

she prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...

                        knox (o.s.)
          i wouldn't do that, if i were you.

she spins to see knox, standing behind her.

                        knox (cont'd)
          see, if you snip any of those wires,
          the bomb will blow up.

                        dylan
          it's gonna blow anyway, once the
          clock gets to zero.

                        knox
          who told you that, my idiotic
          henchman? do you think i tell him
          anything that's confidential?

he holds up a small triggering device. it's the same one
we saw pascal try to sell in the opening scene.

                        knox (cont'd)
          this is what triggers that bomb.     so
          if you'll kindly step away, i'll
          refrain from killing both of us.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                             99.

continued:
realizing she has no choice, dylan stands up and backs away.

                        knox (cont'd)
          in different circumstances, dylan, i
          think you and i could have worked out.
          we have a lot in common.

                        dylan
          yeah, i fall for assholes, and you
          are one.

knox laughs.

                        knox
          good one.
                 (beat, as he backs up)
          well, i must be going. if you like
          your body parts attached to your
          torso, i suggest you do the same.

knox turns to go, but the other angels are blocking his way.

                        alex
          give it up, knox. you're surrounded.

                        natalie
          give us the detonator.

                        knox
          no!

stumbling backwards, knox holds it up high.

                        knox (cont'd)
          i'll blow this building sky high, i swear!

                        charlie (o.s.)
          don't do it, eric. it's me you want,
          not all these innocent people.

everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.

                        knox
          charlie?

that's right, it's charlie. finally, after all these years,
we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.

he's not what we expected. short, portly, dressed in a
"we're #1" t-shirt; the angels are absolutely floored by
charlie's appearance.

                        angels
          charlie?

charlie ignores their stares and addresses knox directly.
                                              (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                 100.

continued:

                           charlie
             your father was a double agent, eric.
             yes, i revealed him, but he was killed
             by his own people before we could
             throw him in jail.
                    (beat)
             he was my friend.

                           knox
             it's still your fault, you arrogant
             prick! you still killed my father!

                           charlie
             maybe. maybe i did. but why should
             you kill all these people? if you
             hate me so much, just shoot me.
             just shoot me, eric.

charlie spreads his arms, leaving knox a plenty wide target.

it's a horribly tense moment.       the angels are frozen, watching
knox decide charlie's fate.

knox is sweating, debating his choices. can he really do
this? charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined.
he starts lowering his gun.

                           knox
             okay.  you're right.
                    (quickly)
             i'll just kill you.

blam!

it all happens in the blink of an eye. knox fires, hitting
charlie in the chest. natalie leaps out and tackles knox.
alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance
to go off.

dylan runs to charlie's side.

                            dylan
             charlie, no.   no!

she hold shim in her arms as the other angels gather round
their fallen leader. he gasps for air.

                           dylan (cont'd)
             he's trying to say something.

then dylan notices something weird. he's not gasping for
air, there's something stuck in his mouth.

with a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. it's a voice
chip, like the one dylan used in the opening scene.

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                101.

continued:
                           voice
             ucch, that tasted terrible!

the voice isn't charlie's. dylan reaches down and rips
off charlie's mask, revealing...

                            natalie
             bosley!   are you okay?

                            bosley
             think so.

he pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small
wound where the bullet grazed his side.

                           bosley (cont'd)
             hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.

dylan laughs, alex ruffles his hair.

                           dylan
             hey, wait a second. if bosley's
             here... then where's charlie?

the angels all look at each other.      no one knows.
