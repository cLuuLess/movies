ext. gorgeous beach - day

the angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in-
hand. bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc
on his sniffer.

charlie is on the cellular speakerphone.

                           charlie's voice
             great work, angels. you'll be happy
             to know you received another
             presidential commendation.

the angels, and bosley, clink glasses.

                           charlie's voice (cont'd)
             enjoy your vacation, angels.

                           the angels
             thank you charlie.
                                                  (continued)

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                                102.

continued:

they toast the speakerphone.

                           charlie's voice
             alex, natalie -- i know you've been
             putting in some long hours on this case,
             so i thought you might enjoy a chance to
             catch up with some old friends.

natalie and alex turn to see

peter and jason

walking across the beach towards them. each is carrying a
drink of his own. they wave. damn those men look good.

alex and natalie share a smile.

                           dylan
             any chance you'll be joining us,
             charlie?

                                                cut to:

a sunny deck

we're in charlie's point-of-view. we can see part of his
reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,
but we get some sense of the man.

he turns away, begins walking.    steps down onto the sand.

                           charlie
                    (to cell phone)
             i'd love to, angels. but i have some
             precious treasures to watch over.

with that, he hangs up. we stay in his p.o.v., walking
across the beach. and it's not just any beach.

to the left, we notice

pete and jason

approaching.    we're on the same beach.

looking right, we see the backs of the angels and bosley.
they have no idea that charlie is walking right behind them.

a beat, then dylan looks back.

she looks directly as us -- at charlie -- tracking as we
move past. does she somehow recognize it's charlie?
from her reaction, it's not clear.

a beat, then we...

charlie's angels - 8/18/99                            103.

reverse angle/not p.o.v.

dylan looks back forward again. did she just see charlie?
her smile tells us she thinks she did.

she raises a toast.

                           dylan
          to charlie.

                           the angels and bosley
          to charlie.

they knock glasses.

right at the moment we should probably fade out, bosley
spills his icy drink in his lap. his eyes go wide.

the angels just have to laugh.

we freeze frame, then...

cut to black.
