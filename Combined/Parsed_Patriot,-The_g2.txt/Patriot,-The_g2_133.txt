ext.  patriot encampment - acworth - evening

grim.  the most rudimentary of the encampments we've seen.
rain pours.  some of marion's men huddle under lean-to's
and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial
protection from the cold rain.

abner and scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire
going.  rev. oliver tries to cook.

marion and gabriel ride up and dismount.  marion joins
rev. oliver.

				marion
		how many came back?

				rev. oliver
		about a hundred and twenty.  less
		than a third.

marion nods.  he and gabriel join some of the men under
one of the lean-to's.
