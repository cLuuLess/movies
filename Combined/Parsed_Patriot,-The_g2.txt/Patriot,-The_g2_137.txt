ext.  woods - pembroke outskirts - day

silence.  a dark forest of old growth trees.  no
underbrush.  marion and a couple dozen of his men,
including gabriel, rev. oliver, and dalton ride warily on
a carpet of pine needles toward a thin column of smoke,
visible over the treetops in the distance.

with hand signals, marion directs his men to fan out.
they do so, weaving through the dark forest, weapons
ready.
