int.  back room - tavern - night

dark.  marion and billings talk over a bottle.

				billings
		you expect to hold cornwallis with
		militia?

				marion
		i expect to try.

				billings
		trust you and harry lee.  remember
		that damned overland you two thought
		up in '62 to hit fort louis?

				marion
		it worked.  how many men can you
		raise?

				billings
		not many.  dalton, scott, they've
		got their reasons; rev. oliver,
		he believes in the cause; some of
		the young bucks; a few like me with
		nothing to lose...
			   (beat)
		what about you?  you've got a lot to
		lose.

marion drains his glass and stands up.

				marion
		you coming, or not?

billings drains his glass.  they walk out together.
