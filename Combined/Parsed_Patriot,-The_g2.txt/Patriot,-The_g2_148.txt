ext.  marion's encampment - morning

the patriots, continentals and militia, are moving out.
most of the tents have been taken down.  wagons are
rolling out.  companies of continentals march off in good
order.

marion's tent still stands.  his men finish packing up,
storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear
onto their horses.

in the tent

marion still sits.  a fly buzzes.  gabriel's face has
taken on a deathly, ashen look.

lee enters the tent.  he's silent for a moment, then
speaks softly to marion.

				lee
		you have to bury him.

no response.

				lee
		i'll help you bury him.

lee moves toward gabriel's body.

				marion
		don't touch him.

				lee
		how many men have we seen die?

				marion
		two.  gabriel and thomas.

				lee
		they're gone.  and there is nothing
		you or i can do to bring them back.
		but there is something you can do to
		help end all this.

				marion
		it is ended.

				lee
		no.  it's not over yet.  two days
		ride, yorktown, virginia.
		washington, the french, cornwallis
		and tarleton.  it will end, one way
		or another.
			   (beat)
		francis, nothing will replace your
		sons but helping us will justify
		their sacrifice.

marion doesn't respond.  lee waits for a long moment, then
he hears the sound of the departing troops outside the
tent.

he looks at marion, touches him on the shoulder and walks
out.
