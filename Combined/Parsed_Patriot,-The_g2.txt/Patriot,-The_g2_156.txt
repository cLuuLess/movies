ext.  washington's headquarters - yorktown

staff officers.  flags.  tents.  french and american
officers look over maps and sort out dispatches.
messengers, runners and dispatch riders come and go
hurriedly.

the flap of the central hq tent opens and george
washington steps out, followed by a pair of aides.
washington is tall and powerfully-built, an imposing man,
worthy of respect.

he looks around and sees the awe-struck, slightly confused
messenger boy, waiting nearby.

washington, holding the walnut in his hand, motions him
over.

				washington
		did you bring me this?

				runner
		yes, sir.

washington scribbles something on a piece of paper and
hands it to the boy.

				washington
		take this to colonel marion.

				runner
		yes, sir.

the boy runs off.  washington smiles.
