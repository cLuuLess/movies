ext.  patriot encampment - night

mixed gatherings of marion's militia and continentals are
clustered around the campfires, with more continentals
arriving all the time.

some of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with
tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired,
talking quietly.

a couple of patriots play a melancholy tune on fife and
violin.

marion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen.
gabriel walks to marion's gear.  finding marion's weapon's
belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the
paint-flecked musket balls made from thomas' lead
soldiers.  as gabriel takes one, marion steps up behind
him.

				marion
		if this war is about more than
		thomas, it's about more than anne,
		as well.  stay the course.

				gabriel
		as you did at fort wilderness?

before marion can answer they see harry lee ride up to
them.  he dismounts, excited, voluble.  he strides over,
pleased to see marion, oblivious to his and gabriel's
mood.

				lee
		look at you!  i knew you could do
		it!

lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull.

				lee
		we have a chance!  better than a
		chance!  cornwallis is running to
		the chesapeake, probably to meet his
		fleet at yorktown.  i wish i could
		see his face when he sees a dozen
		french ships floating there.  and
		washington should be a day or two
		behind him.
			   (beat)
		and on top of everything, i have a
		son!  born last month in alexandria.

gabriel rises and walks away.  lee finally tunes into the
pall hanging over marion and the just departed gabriel.
he turns to marion.

				marion
		his wife was killed yesterday.  she
		was with child.

				lee
		i'm sorry, i didn't know.

marion nods.  they stand in silence.  lee hands marion the
bottle.  he takes a drink.
