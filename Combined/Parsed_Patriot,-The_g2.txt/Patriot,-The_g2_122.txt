int.  tobacco shed - night

pouring rain.  the ceiling drips.  marion lies, awake,
with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one of
the few dry spots.  they're covered with tattered quilts.

on the other side of the children, charlotte is also
awake.  she and marion exchange a long, silent look in the
darkness, over the heads of the sleeping children.
