ext.  rollins' farm - day

the small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, where
the two boys, rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catch
a glimpse of the passing marion and his brigade.

the house smolders.  no sign of life.  gabriel, abner and
a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared
area around the house.

marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits next
to an increasingly frantic, rollins.  they see gabriel
wave, signaling all clear.

marion, rollins and the other men ride to the house.
rollins is the first to see the bodies.  horrified, he
reins back and dismounts, almost falling.

his two sons, wife, an older man and woman, lie dead in
the dirt.  marion's men silently watch rollins' agony.
weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner,
as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being
jerked by a drunken puppeteer.

marion and rev. oliver dismount and move toward him.
rollins sees them coming.  he hardens and strides to his
horse, pulling his flintlock pistol from his saddle
holster.

rev. oliver reaches out to embrace rollins.

				rev. oliver
		it's not time for vengeance, it's
		time to mourn and...

rollins puts the pistol to his head and pulls the trigger,
blowing his brains out.

every man freezes in place.  for a long moment no one
moves, no one speaks.  then marion pulls himself together
and addresses the men:

				marion
		five day furlough for all men.
		abner, dan, reverend, spread the
		word.  we'll reform at acworth.  any
		man who doesn't come back won't be
		thought a coward or uncommitted to
		the cause.  attend to your families.

the men mount up.  marion and gabriel ride off together.
