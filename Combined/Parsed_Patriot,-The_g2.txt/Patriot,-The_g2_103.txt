ext.  charlotte's house - night

a torch burns.  a dozen dragoons light torches off of it
and fan out to search.  the thick fog turns the torches
into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the
dragoons into ghost-like apparitions.

camera follows one of the torches, carried by a
particularly rough-looking dragoon who skirts the edge of
the underbrush closest to the house.  as the torch moves,
its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the
underbrush...

the camera stops to reveal, in the brush, two faces,
gabriel and charlotte, dark, motionless, watching the
search.  behind them, marion's other children, nathan,
samuel, margaret, william and susan...

around them, several more of marion's men, including abner
brown, weapons ready.  the moving lights play on their
faces.

at the front of the house, the torches converge,
illuminating tarleton who gives the unheard order.  the
torches fan out and begin setting fire to the house, barns
and outbuildings.

margaret grips charlotte's arm.  gabriel motions and they
all ease back, disappearing into the brush.
