ext.  encampment - night

dark.  quiet.  sentries are on duty.  marion's tent glows
from a single candle.  he blows the candle out, then steps
out of the tent into the night.

he begins his nightly walk of the perimeter.

almost immediately, marion notices something amiss.
dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over
to marion.

at one of the campsites

marion and dalton and several of the other men look down
at some empty bedrolls.

				dalton
		gabriel and at least a dozen others.
		they must have left right after the
		watch change.

				marion
		that means they have two hours on
		us.

marion strides to his horse.  the other men follow him.
