tarleton and wilkins wait while green dragoons and
loyalists search the remains of marion's house and barn.
gaskins, filthy from the ashes, walks up to tarleton.

				gaskins
		nothing.

				wilkins
		no one's been here for months.

				tarleton
		but now we have a name for our
		colonel... francis marion.  and with
		a name will come a family.
