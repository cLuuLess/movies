ext.  small farmhouse - sunset

tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a
farmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedly
picking at the petals of some wildflowers.  a hideous
scream pierces the calm.

tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream,
then rises, passing several green dragoons who wait with
their horses in front of the farmhouse.

				tarleton
		i believe they are almost ready.

in the farmhouse

blood is smeared on one wall, where half-a-dozen corpses
lie in a jumbles mass on the floor.

in the parlor, tarleton walks past more bodies, including
a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over
the bloody bodies of her two young children, both under
eight-years-old.

in the kitchen, tarleton finds wilkins, some green
dragoons, and gaskins, the loyalist militia commander and
some of his low-life men.

rob fielding, one of the craftsmen in marion's force, is
tied, spread-eagle to the table, showing the terrible
effects of protracted torture.  wilkins and gaskins are
nervous and apologetic as tarleton walks into the room.

				gaskins
		i'm sorry, sir.  he died.

tarleton sighs, irritated.

				tarleton
		very well, get one of the others.

gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached
woodshed where billings sits, bound.  they roughly grab
him and drag him into the kitchen.

				billings
		damn your eyes.  do your worst.

				tarleton
		i intend to.

they tie billings to the table.
