ext.  wooded road - night

marion, rev. oliver and abner ride slowly down the road.
it's a beautiful, moonlit night.  marion breaks the
silence, speaking as much for himself as the others.

		it's a good measure of a woman that
		she'll have her honeymoon under the
		stars.

				rev. oliver
		for richer, for poorer, in sickness
		and in health, 'til death do they
		part.

marion nods.  they ride on.
