ext.  wooded encampment - night

a dark, moonless night.  the sky is filled with stars.  a
soft wind blows dead leaves along the ground.  a few of
the leaves are blown through the opening of marion's tent.

inside the tent

marion looks down, noticing the leaves, hearing the wind.
he listens for a moment.  then he stands and walks out of
the tent.

outside the tent

marion watches the leaves skittering along the ground.  he
listens to the wind.

the he looks up at the night sky.  the stars are bright.
his eyes are drawn to the big dipper and from there to the
little dipper and the...

north star.

holding his eyes on the faint, but steady star, he
gradually reorients himself.  he looks around at the
abandoned encampment.  then he looks into the tent and
sees gabriel's body.  the soft wind blows around him.
marion nods in response.
