the canadian geese fly over anne who is behind her
father's store, tying food and provisions to a couple of
packhorses.  a mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock.

suddenly anne senses someone behind her and turns to see
half-a dozen redcoats.  she's initially frightened but the
redcoat sergeant, speaks politely.

				redcoat sergeant
		excuse me, ma'am, everyone has been
		requested to gather at the church.

				anne
		everyone?

				redcoat sergeant
		colonel tarleton wants to address,
		the whole village.

the redcoat sergeant deferentially motions for anne to
follow him and his men.  she sees several other
townspeople, with redcoat escorts, already heading down
the street.  she follows along.
