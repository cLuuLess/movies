ext.  british lines - day

cornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including
tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a
spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the
morning mist begins to burn off.

through the fog, he just makes out the american lines.  he
turns to tarleton who also peers through a spyglass.

				cornwallis
		do you see that, colonel?

				tarleton
		unless i'm dreaming, i think i see
		irregulars at their center.

cornwallis and tarleton exchange a pleased look.
