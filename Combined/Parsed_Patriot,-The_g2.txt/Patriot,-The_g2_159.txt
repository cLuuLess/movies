ext.  cornwallis' headquarters - yorktown - evening

under fire.  cornwallis and his staff.  major halbert
strides in and gives cornwallis a dispatch.

				major halbert
		sir, a dispatch from general clinton
		made it through the rebel lines.

cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it.  it staggers
him.  he sits down.

				wilkins

crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury.
