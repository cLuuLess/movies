ext.  glen - cheraw falls - night

marion walks into the glen.  he tenses, sensing someone in
front of him.  then he sees charlotte at the edge of the
woods.  neither one speaks...

they walk silently to each other.  they stop, looking at
each other closely, as if seeing one another for the first
time...

only then do they kiss.  the kiss grows more passionate...
then much more passionate...
