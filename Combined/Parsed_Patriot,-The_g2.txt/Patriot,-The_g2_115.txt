ext.  small farmhouse - day

marion's men dig graves.  marion watches.  dalton steps up
next to him.

				dalton
		you still want me to give wounded
		redcoats quarter?

marion doesn't answer.  gabriel gallops up.  he reins back
his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting.

				gabriel
		tarleton has a list of our men, most
		are on it.  a regiment of dragoons
		is going to the homes on the list,
		burning them, killing whomever
		resists, women and children, as
		well.

				marion
		where?

				gabriel
		seven homes along the black river so
		far...

rollins doesn't pause.  he rushes to his horse, mounts up
and rides off.  marion and the other men mount up and ride
off fast after him.
