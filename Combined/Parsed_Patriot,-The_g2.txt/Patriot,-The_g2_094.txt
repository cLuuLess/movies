int.  cornwallis' headquarters - day

major halbert ushers marion in.  the great danes follow
sniffing curiously, sensing something or someone.

				major halbert
		lord cornwallis will be with you
		presently.

				marion
		thank you.

				major halbert
		you may, of course, keep your
		weapons, but i must warn you that...

				marion
			   (interrupting)
		i'm familiar with appropriate
		behavior at a military parley.

				major halbert
		yes, quite, but you should know
		that...

				marion
		that will be all, major.  i'll wait
		for lord cornwallis.

				major halbert
			   (coldly)
		yes... you will wait.

major halbert turns and starts to stride out.

				marion
		one other thing.

major halbert stops.

				marion
		the proper form of address to a
		superior officer, even one of an
		opposing army, is "yes, sir."

major halbert sneers and strides from the room.  marion
alone, except for the dogs, allows himself a fleeting
smile.  then he looks around the room.  he notes a rocking
chair.  curious, he hefts it.  too heavy.  he puts it
down, sits and rocks.  the dogs walk over and lay at his
feet.
