ext.  assembly hall - day

the crowd waits.  the doors open and a page boy dashes out
and runs to the continental captain at the recruiting
table.

				page boy
		twenty-eight to twelve, the levy
		passed!

the continental captain motions to an assembled squadron.
they raise their muskets and fire a volley into the air.
other soldiers, strike up a martial air on fifes and
drums.  volunteers crowd around the recruiting table,
yelling and jostling for position.

the delegates walk out.  both patriots and loyalists give
marion a wide berth.

marion sees gabriel, standing near the crowd at the
recruiting table.  marion walks up to him.

				gabriel
		father, i've lost respect for you.
		i thought you were a man of
		principle.

				marion
		when you have children, i hope
		you'll understand.

				gabriel
		when i have children, i hope i don't
		hide behind them.

marion looks closely at gabriel.

				marion
		do you intend to enlist without my
		permission?

				gabriel
		yes.

they lock eyes for a moment, then gabriel turns from his
father and walks away, joining the crush around the
recruiting table.

marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos.  the fifes
and drums continue to play.  marion doesn't hear them.

harry lee walks out of the assembly hall with a triumphant
group of patriots who look at marion coldly.

lee excuses himself, and steps over next to marion.  lee
sees that marion is watching gabriel at the enlistment
table.

				lee
		one of yours?

				marion
		gabriel.

				lee
		i recognize him now.  is he as
		imprudent as his father was at his
		age?

				marion
		no, thank the lord.  he's more like
		his mother.

				lee
		i'll see to it that he serves under
		me.

				marion
		thank you.

they shake hands.  then lee walks over to the soldiers.
marion takes a last look at gabriel, then heads off
through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men
headed toward the recruiting table.
