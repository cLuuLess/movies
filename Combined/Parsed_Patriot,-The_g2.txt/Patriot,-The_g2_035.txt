ext.  marion's house - pond bluff - day

the porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital.
there are about two dozen wounded, a few more patriots
than redcoats.  thomas, nathan, samuel and margaret help
marion tend the soldiers.  william and susan watch from
inside.

marion treats an arm wound, retying a tourniquet,
stanching an ugly flow of blood.

marion moves to the next of the wounded.  thomas starts to
help but marion shakes his head.

				marion
		he's dead...

marion moves on to another.

				marion
		thomas, help me turn him over...

they turn over a young continental and see a horrible
wound on his back.  thomas, swoons.

				marion
		thomas!

a hard glare from marion strengthens his son.  together
they bandage the wounded man.
