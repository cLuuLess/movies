ext.  charlotte's balcony - night

marion's children, except gabriel, stand on the balcony
watching the mob.  marion steps out onto the balcony.

				marion
		inside, all of you...

the children turn to marion with stricken expressions.
marion relents.

				marion
		very well.

the children turn back to the mob.  marion joins them.

				thomas
		look!  there's gabriel!

they see gabriel making his way through the crowd.  he
sees them and waves, then enters the house.

a moment later charlotte steps out onto the balcony and
sees:

in the square, a pair of drunk sons of liberty, pull down
one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then
start hacking at it's groin with a sword.

appalled, charlotte shoots a glare at marion and snaps at
the children.

				charlotte
		children, inside!  all of you!
		right now.

the children start to protest, but a glance at charlotte's
resolute expression makes them think better of it.  they
file into the house.  charlotte shoots a glare at marion
and shoos the children inside.  gabriel steps out and
joins them.

				marion
		what news?

				gabriel
		the british army is barricaded in
		boston.  harry lee, is here from
		virginia, recruiting for a
		continental army.

				marion
		is that why the assembly was
		convened?

				gabriel
		yes.  he seeks a levy of troops and
		money.

				marion
		and the governor?

				gabriel
		he vowed that if the assembly votes
		a single shilling to lee, he'll
		dissolve the body.

				marion
		which would force our delegates in
		philadelphia to vote for
		independence.

				charlotte
		and send us to war alongside
		massachusetts.

				marion
		our governor is a bigger fool than i
		thought.

				gabriel
		lee is counting on your vote and
		expects you to be the first to
		enlist.

marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks
of lee's expectations.  marion turns back to watch the
mob.
