ext.  field - pond bluff - day

marion plows a field.  nathan leads the plowhorse.  samuel
follows, breaking up the clods of dirt.  hard work.  they
stop to catch their breath.  a soft wind blows.

marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice.
he hears nothing.  he snaps the reins and continues
plowing.
