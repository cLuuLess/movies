marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave.
near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns to
elizabeth's gravestone.  the soft wind blows.  marion
listens.

he turns and sees his children looking up at him.  holding
in his own tears, he gathers the children around him and
let's them cry.

				marion
		there, there... he's alright... he's
		with your mother now...

he stiffens, speaking formally:

				marion
		lord, we pray that you accept this
		child, thomas marion and give him a
		place at your side with his mother.
		we ask that you embrace him and help
		us to understand the manner in which
		your mercy works.  this we ask, in
		your name.  amen.

				marion's children
		amen.

marion looks at elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases
his children away.
