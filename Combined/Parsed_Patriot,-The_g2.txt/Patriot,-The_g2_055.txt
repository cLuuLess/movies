ext.  american encampment - night (later)

marion and gabriel stand watching lee and his continental
regulars move out.  gabriel turns to marion.

				gabriel
		what now, sir?

				marion
		we put out the word.  we'll start
		along the south side of the
		santee...

				gabriel
		we'd cover more ground if we split
		up.

				marion
		it's safer if we stay together.

gabriel steps in front of marion.

				gabriel
		colonel, i didn't request this
		transfer because you're my father.
		i requested it because i believe in
		this cause and this is where i can
		do the most good.

				marion
		oh?

				gabriel
		i've been doing this for two years.
		i'm the best scout in the
		continental army, the best horseman,
		the best shot, the best scavenger
		and i know every deer path and swamp
		trail between here and charleston.

				marion
		is that so?

				gabriel
		yes, sir.
			   (beat)
		my father taught me.

marion looks at gabriel closely.

				marion
		did your father teach you humility?

				gabriel
		he tried.  it didn't take.

marion looks gabriel up and down.

				marion
		alright, corporal, you take
		bennington, harrisville, acworth and
		the farms along black swamp.  i'll
		take the north side of the river.
		we'll meet at snow's island.

				gabriel
		yes, sir.

they mount up.

				marion
		and, corporal...
			   (beat)
		... be careful.

				gabriel
		yes...
			   (beat)
		... father.

they ride off in different directions.
