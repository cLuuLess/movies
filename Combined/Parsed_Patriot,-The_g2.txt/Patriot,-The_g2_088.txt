ext.  wooded glen - night

dark.  marion and his battered men gather, taking stock.
men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past
wary sentries.  gabriel rides up, dismounts and reports to
marion, out of earshot of the other men.

				gabriel
		fourteen dead, eleven wounded,
		eighteen captured.

				marion
		i should have killed him when i had
		the chance?

				gabriel
		when was that?  in the swamp at the
		expense of your men?  or when he
		killed thomas at the expense of your
		family?

				marion
		no...

				gabriel
		or perhaps tomorrow at the expense
		of our cause.

marion is silent.

				gabriel
		there will be a time and a place for
		revenge but killing tarleton at the
		expense of your duty serves no one
		but yourself.
			   (beat)
		stay the course.

the parental-sounding formality of gabriel's words brings
a thin smile to marion's face.

				marion
		stay the course... your mother used
		to say that to me when i'd get drunk
		or lose my temper.

				gabriel
		she'd say it to me when i picked on
		thomas or nathan.

				marion
		you learned her lessons better than
		i.

				gabriel
		she got me at a more impressionable
		age.

marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads
over to help with the wounded.
