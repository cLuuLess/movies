marion washes the knife carefully, almost obsessively.
anne steps up behind him.

				anne
		may i ask you a question?

marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without
explanation.

				marion
		yes, of course.

she speaks with a sly, withheld smile.

				anne
		do you think frances with an "e" is
		too manly a name for a girl?

				marion

				anne
		do you think francis with an "i" is
		too womanly a name for a boy?

				marion
		no.

				anne

just told him.

				marion

				anne
