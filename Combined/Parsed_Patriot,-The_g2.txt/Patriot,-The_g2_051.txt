ext.  porch - charlotte's farmhouse - morning

marion and gabriel finish saddling their horses.  marion
embraces nathan and samuel.  then he turns to margaret,
william and susan.

				william
		when will you be back?

				marion
		i don't know, william.

				william
		tomorrow?

marion winces.  margaret puts her arm around william.

				margaret
		no, not tomorrow.

marion kisses them both, then moves on to susan, trying to
coax a word out of the silent four-year-old:

				marion
		goodbye?

she just looks at him.

				marion
		just one word?  goodbye?  that's all
		i want.

susan shakes her head.  he sighs, rises and turns to
charlotte.  they hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply
but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment
longer than one would expect.  she looks up at him... he
kisses her on the cheek.

marion mounts up.  and he and gabriel head off, susan,
unnoticed and unheard, whispers:

				susan
		goodbye.

marion and gabriel ride away.
