int.  marion's attic - late afternoon

dark.  thomas steps up into the attic.  he finds a trunk
and opens it.  lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a
trove of marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat,
a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its
scabbard.

thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow
shoulders.  he stands in front of a dusty mirror,
appraising himself, then stops as he hears footsteps
coming up the stairs.

it's marion, tired and dirty from his plowing.  thomas
grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake
his head gently.

				marion
		not yet, thomas.

				thomas
		when?

marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesy
of really thinking about the answer.

				marion
		seventeen.

				thomas
		but it's already been two years and
		that's two more years.  the war
		could be over by then.

				marion
		god willing.

thomas considers it, then nods.

				thomas
		alright.  seventeen.

marion offers his hand.  they shake firmly, like adults.
marion takes the coat off thomas and puts it back in the
trunk.  they walk down the stairs together.
