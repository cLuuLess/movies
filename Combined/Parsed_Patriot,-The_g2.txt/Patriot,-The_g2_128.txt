ext.  cheraw falls - day

marion's children swim and play with the two great danes
in the pond at the base of the falls, along with gabriel
and anne.  marion and charlotte sit on the bank, watching
them.

charlotte turns and looks at marion for a long moment.
he's unaware.  as charlotte looks at him, her smile
disappears, replaced by anger.  she snaps at marion.

				charlotte
		i'm not my sister.

startled, marion turns to charlotte.

				marion
		excuse me?

				charlotte
		i said, i'm not my sister.

				marion
		i know that.

				charlotte
		do you?

				marion
		of course, i do.

				charlotte
			   (irritated)
		very well, then.

she turns from him.  marion, tries to figure out what just
happened.  after a long moment he gets it.  stunned at
first, his gears turn.  after a very thoughtful moment he
turns to charlotte and offers a tentative smile.  she
rolls her eyes.
