int.  cornwallis' personal quarters - evening

cornwallis, standing in front of a full-length mirror, is
dressed by his valet while major halbert, colonel
huntington and tarleton look on.

				cornwallis
		why am i here, colonel halbert?

				major halbert
		for the ball, sir?

cornwallis holds his temper.

				cornwallis
		why, after six weeks, are we still
		here to attend a ball.  by now, we
		should be attending balls in north
		carolina, not south carolina.

				major halbert
		our supply line, sir?

				cornwallis
		excellent guess, major.

the valet puts a dress coat on cornwallis who looks at the
garment with deepest disdain.

				cornwallis
		and what, praytell, is this?

				valet
		uh... i borrowed it from colonel
		north.  i took it in at the back,
		added wider epaulets, a court sash
		and looped gold braiding on the
		cuffs...

				cornwallis
		it's a horse blanket.
			   (to major halbert)
		first my personal baggage, then half
		the bridges and ferries between here
		and charleston burned, a dozen
		convoys attacked.  colonel, if you
		can't secure our supply line against
		militia, how do you expect to do so
		against colonial regulars or the
		french when they come?

				colonel halbert
		sir, they're not like regulars, we
		can't find them and we don't know
		when or where they're going to
		strike.

				cornwallis
		how impolite.  and who leads these
		clever, secretive fellows?

				colonel halbert
		we don't know, sir.  he's called,
		the commander by some, the swamp fox
		by others.

				cornwallis
		colonel, i'm a civilized man but i'm
		finding to difficult to remain
		civil.  secure my supply line.

				colonel halbert
		yes, sir.

cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs and
strides out.  tarleton, amused, follows.
