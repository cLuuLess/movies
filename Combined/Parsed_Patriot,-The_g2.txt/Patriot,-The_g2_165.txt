ext.  yorktown field - day

a massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on
the cleaned up battlefield.

thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well-
directed actors in a grand theatrical performance.

the french and american armies, fifteen thousand men
between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of
the field, forming an avenue for the british army which
marches out of it's fortification.

at the head of the avenue, washington and his staff stand
waiting.

a musical band of continentals, thirty men strong, loudly
plays a tune, "the world turned upside down," a jaunty
british air with a melancholy undercurrent.

cornwallis marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead,
covering his agony as best he can.

as he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the
south carolina militia.

marion, standing with dalton, rev. oliver, abner, scott
and the rest of his surviving men sees cornwallis pass...

cornwallis glances over, noting what unit they are by a
tattered battle standard that flies over them.  it's only
a glance and he doesn't pick out marion, who is just one
man among the many...

at the head of the avenue

cornwallis reaches washington.  they exchange unheard
formal greetings.

cornwallis, draws his sword and hands it to washington...

fifteen thousand men, american and french, raise their
voices in a cheer of astonishing volume...

with every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony
between washington and cornwallis, marion quietly and
unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks
away.
