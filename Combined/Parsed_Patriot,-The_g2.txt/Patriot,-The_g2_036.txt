ext.  marion's house - afternoon

triage completed.  margaret and samuel give water and
food.  marion kneels next to a continental sergeant and a
couple of privates who are less severely wounded than the
others.

				continental sergeant
		thank you.

marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks.

				marion
		sergeant, there are seventeen
		wounded men here.  seven redcoats
		and ten patriots, counting my son
		inside.  that puts me in a difficult
		position.

the continental sergeant knows what's coming.  the
privates and marion's children don't.

				marion
		you three are the least severely
		wounded.  i have to ask you to leave
		and find care elsewhere.

the privates are stunned at the request.  the sergeant
looks at marion's children and nods.

				sergeant
		i understand.

he struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two
privates to do the same.

				sergeant
		come on, boys.

nathan, samuel and margaret are confused.

				thomas
		father?

				nathan
		but they're wounded.

				marion
		there are rules, even in war.

marion motions to a large, old scar on his arm.

				marion
		after the battle of ashuelot river,
		against the french, i got this and
		the one on my leg.  i couldn't walk.
		washington had to march north.  he
		left me with other wounded men and a
		like number of french prisoners.
		nine for nine.  when the french
		found us, their surgeon gave me the
		best of care.  we'll be safe this
		way.

marion's children are not convinced.  the sergeant and the
two privates gather themselves to leave.

				marion
		your best chance is in bennington,
		seven miles east, along the river
		road.

the wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road.

				marion
		thank you.

marion and his children watch them go.
