ext.  cheraw falls - night

the remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm.  the
house is gone, leaving only an overgrown cellar hole.

nearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed, one end of which
has fallen to the ground.  a soft wind whistles and
whispers through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the
structure.

marion rides up to the edge of the clearing.  a
mockingbird screeches nearby, startling him.  he looks
back at the children, worried, anticipating a negative
reaction.  margaret smiles and turns to the other
children, speaking for marion's benefit.

		i told you, things would get better.

the children smile and dismount.
