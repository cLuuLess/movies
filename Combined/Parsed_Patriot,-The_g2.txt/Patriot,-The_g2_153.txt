ext.  yorktown road - day

the american forces are on the move, all heading in the
same direction.  continentals and militiamen fill the
road.  some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot.

among them, a mixed unit of continentals and marion's
brigade, at the head of which ride lee, dalton, abner and
rev. oliver.

behind them, a single horseman rides up.  it's marion.
without speaking, marion rides up alongside lee.  they
exchange nods.

marion rides between dalton on one side and rev. oliver on
the other.  they pass a sign that reads, "yorktown.  20
miles."
