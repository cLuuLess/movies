int.  tavern - bradford - night

as marion walks in he's greeted by cold stares from half-
a-dozen men, huddles over their drinks.

				marion
		i'm looking for john billings.

				bartender
		he's dead.

marion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men.

				marion
		if he comes back from the dead, tell
		him francis marion is looking for
		him.

				bartender
		i'll be sure to do that.

as marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of
madeira on one of the tables.  he stops.

				marion
		i'll wait.  miracles happen.

a stand-off.  then, a hulking figure appears in the
shadows at the back doorway.  he's john billings, big,
coarse, about marion's age.  billings jerks his head for
marion to join him in the back room.
