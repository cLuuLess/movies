int.  charlotte's house - night

a fire crackles in the fireplace.  a curtain blows in the
open window.  the door bursts open.  windows break.  green
dragoons pour into the house, muskets brandished.  no sign
of occupants.  captain morrow barks a command:

				captain morrow
		upstairs!

the dragoons thunder up the stairs... tarleton and wilkins
stride in, watching the search... the parlor... nothing...
the kitchen... food is cooking...

the dining room... the table is set, half-eaten food is on
the plates, abandoned in mid-meal.  tarleton walks into
the dining room, touches some of the food, gauging its
warmth.

				tarleton
		they can't be far.  check the
		outbuildings and the woods.

the dragoons race outside.
