ext.  pond bluff - evening

summer.  the apple tree at the top of the hill is covered
with apples.

marion's house is partially rebuilt and habitable.  the
workshop is already completed.

marion's children, nathan, samuel, margaret and william,
play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two
great danes.

charlotte sits on the front porch, nursing an infant.

marion walks out of his workshop, trailed by susan.  he
carries a just-completed rocking chair.

the chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web
of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue.

he steps onto the porch next to charlotte and places the
rocking chair next to her.

				marion
		two pounds, fourteen ounces.

				charlotte
		lovely.

he smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's
position.  then he sits down, settles back and begins
rocking.  not a creak.

marion and charlotte watch susan run out of the yard,
calling as she joins the other children.

				susan
		wait for me...

as the camera cranes up, marion and charlotte disappear
beneath the overhang of the porch roof.  suddenly, the
sound of a crash.

				marion (o.s.)
		damnation!

the camera continues to crane up as marion walks off the
porch, crosses the yard and enters his workshop.  a moment
later, the sound of marion's lathe rises.
