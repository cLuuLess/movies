int.  marion's tent - night

dark.  shadowed.  the sounds of celebration can be heard
outside the tent.

marion sits on his camp chair.  gabriel lies on the ground
carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket.  a single
candle burns.

rev. oliver enters the tent.

				rev. oliver
		may i help you try to find solace
		with the word of god?

no response.

				rev. oliver
		colonel, let us help his soul find
		it's place with the almighty and...

				marion
		he looks as if he's sleeping,
		doesn't he?

				rev. oliver
		yes, he does.

rev. oliver pulls up a camp stool.  he and marion sit in
silence.
