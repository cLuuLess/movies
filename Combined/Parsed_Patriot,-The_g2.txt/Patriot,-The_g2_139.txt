ext.  pembroke - day

marion's men, led by rev. oliver, tend to the dead.  some
dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the
church.  others carry out the grim task of pulling the
charred bodies out of the rubble.

on the edge of town

marion sits alone.  gabriel walks up behind him.

				gabriel
		father, tell me what happened at
		fort wilderness?

				marion
		you know what happened.

				gabriel
		no, i don't.

				marion
		everyone knows.  it's what made me a
		hero.  me, harry lee, all of us.  i
		got a medal.  men bought me drinks.
		they still do sometimes.  everyone
		knows what happened.

				gabriel
		tell me what everyone doesn't know.

				marion
		and what do they know?

				gabriel
		that the french and cherokees
		captured the fort and when you
		retook it, you took revenge on them
		for what they did during the
		occupation.

				marion
		that's right.

				gabriel
		that's not enough.  tell me.

				marion
		your mother asked me the same
		question around the time you were
		born.  i was drunk and i was foolish
		enough to answer her.

marion shakes his head to himself.

				marion
		that's why it was four years between
		you and thomas.  it took me that
		long to regain her respect.

				gabriel
		i'm not my mother.  i can't have the
		respect without the knowing.

marion's quiet for a moment.  then he speaks:

				marion
		it was in '63.  it was a bad time.
		the french and the cherokee had
		raided along the blue ridge.  all
		the english settlers took refuge at
		fort wilderness but the french
		captured it.  we were sent in
		relief.  harry lee, billings, sixty
		of us.  we already had something of
		a reputation for being... harsh.
		when we got there the fort was
		abandoned.  not a french soldier or
		cherokee anywhere.  they had left a
		week earlier.  what we found was...
		bad.

marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad.

				marion
		they had left the settlers there.
		the men had been burned alive, the
		women were in pieces and the
		children were on stakes.

marion's silent for a moment.

				marion
		we buried them, then we went to
		track.  it was a cold trail and they
		were moving fast.  we went faster.
		we caught up to them at kentucky
		ford.

				gabriel
		go on.

				marion
		we took our time with them and gave
		every one of them worse than they
		had given at the fort.  it was two
		weeks before they were all dead, all
		except two.  we put the heads on a
		pallet and had the two we let live
		take it to the french at fort
		ambercon.
			   (beat)
		the eyes, fingers and tongues we put
		in a basket and sent that down the
		asheulot to the cherokee.
			   (beat)
		the french stayed east of the blue
		ridge after that and the cherokee
		broke their treaty with the french
		and stayed out of the fight.
			   (beat)
		that seemed to make a difference.
		the war went another year, things
		went better... and men bought us
		drinks.

gabriel is silent.  marion looks at him closely.

				marion
		it was a different time, son.  and
		you're a better man than that.

				gabriel
		i see, do as i say, not as i do.

				marion
		yes.

they hear horses hooves.  abner rides in from the opposite
side of the village from the church, not having seen the
results of the massacre.  excited, he dismounts.

				abner
		they're here!  continentals, they're
		here!

marion and gabriel just look at him.  abner is confused by
their reaction.  then he sees the remains of the church
and the laid out, charred bodies.
