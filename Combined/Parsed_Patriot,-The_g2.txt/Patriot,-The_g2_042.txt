ext.  river shed - pond bluff - day

margaret waits in the shed with william and susan.  they
hear a sound.  approaching footsteps.  margaret pulls her
sister and brother to her and waits.

the door opens.  it's marion and gabriel, nathan and
samuel.  margaret and the little ones throw themselves
into marion's arms.

margaret notices the blood on marion.  she hesitates but
her relief tightens her embrace.
