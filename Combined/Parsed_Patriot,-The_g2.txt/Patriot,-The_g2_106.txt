ext.  marion's encampment - day

an astonished marion talks to gabriel.

				marion
		she spoke?  susan spoke?

				gabriel
		full sentences.  as if she had been
		speaking all along.

				marion
		i don't believe it... and i wasn't
		there for it...

the cloud passes quickly.

				marion
		tell me everything she said, word
		for word.

gabriel hesitates.

				gabriel
		she said... she loves you and misses
		you but she understands why you
		can't be there with her.

				marion
		she said that?  oh, my lord, she said
		that?

gabriel nods.

				marion
		isn't that something.

marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself.
gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject.

				gabriel
		father, there's something else i
		need to talk to you about.

				marion
		what?

				gabriel
		come with me.  i'll tell you when we
		get there.

marion nods and curiously follows gabriel.
