ext.  armory - night

a block-like building on the far edge of town.  a pair of
redcoats stand guard.  a pair of drunken redcoats stagger
out of a side-street, singing a mumbling song.  the
redcoat guards look at the drunk redcoats enviously.

				redcoat guard
		hey, what you got there?

the drunken redcoats look up, bringing their faces into
the light -- the drunken redcoats are billings and dalton.

				billings
		we got our own little party...

				dalton
		to hell with the officers and their
		fancy dress ball...

				guard
		give us a nip, here.

billings and dalton walk over to the redcoats guards.  as
the guards reach for the bottles, billings slams one of
the guards back against the building...

dalton draws a knife and plunges it into the second
guard's belly and hacks him open...

dalton shoves billings out of the way, slits the other
guard's throat.  billings is taken aback by the speed and
ferocity of dalton's attack...

marion and scott duck into the shadows of the doorway,
pull out hammer-less carving chisels and quickly and
silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of
the heavy door.

billings and dalton take the posts of the guards while the
other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight.
everything appears as it should.
