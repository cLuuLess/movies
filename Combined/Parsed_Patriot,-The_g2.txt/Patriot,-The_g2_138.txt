ext.  pembroke - day

marion and his men slowly ride into pembroke.  the remains
of the church smolder only slightly.  the town is
deserted, no one, dead or alive, is visible.

unsure what they have found, marion and his men spread out
and dismount, warily checking out the buildings, looking
for some sign of life.

rev. oliver and a few other men head for the charred
remains of the church.

side-stepping some still-hot, charred beams, rev. oliver
looks through the rubble...

then he sees the bodies...

the camera catches only a fleeting glimpse of...

dozens of charred, blackened bodies, intertwined with the
remains of the church...

rev. oliver staggers from the rubble...

the other men see what he has seen...

one-by-one marion and his men walk over and look into the
remains of the church...

marion see several charred hands extended through a
shattered window, as if grasping for escape... one of the
hands is tiny, a child's hand...

marion is stunned...

no one says a word...

dalton and a few of the other men continue the search,
weapons ready...

they step into the livery stable, then walk out a moment
later, ashen faced...

dalton speaks quietly to marion, motioning toward an
increasingly frantic gabriel who has just found anne's
packhorses...

gabriel notices the gesture, he watches marion walk into
the livery stable... growing more nervous by the second,
gabriel hurries after his father...

				gabriel
		anne...?

as gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable,
marion walks out and intercepts him.

				marion
		don't go in there.

				gabriel
		is it her?  is anne in there?

				marion
		she is.  don't go in there.

gabriel understands... he reels... growing faint... marion
grabs him... keeping him from falling...

marion holds gabriel who begins to weep...
