int.  bedroom - night

charlotte sits, holding a sleeping susan.  the other
children lie awake on pallets.  marion, still streaked
with dried blood and sweat, tucks william and margaret
into bed.

				marion
		sleep, now.

marion moves on to nathan.

				nathan
		father... i killed those men...

				marion
		don't blame yourself, you did what i
		told you to do.

				nathan
		i'm glad i killed them... i'm
		glad...

marion isn't.  he turns to samuel who's cried-out.  marion
reaches out to touch him but samuel recoils from marion's
blood-streaked hand.  marion sighs and tucks him in.

				marion
		try to get some sleep.

marion moves to take susan from charlotte who shakes her
head.

				charlotte
		i'll stay with them.

marion nods and leaves charlotte with the children.
