ext.  hilltop - pond bluff - sunset

the loveliest spot on the farm.  a beautiful view of the
house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond.  a
gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree.  it
reads:

		elizabeth putnam marion   1738-1773

above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the
center of which is the north star, steady and guiding.

marion approaches.  he gives himself a moment to look at
the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the
gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact
than sorrowful.

				marion
		... and they bundled half... almost
		no trace of the boys you knew...

a soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground.
marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply.

				marion
		... no, she still hasn't spoken...
		margaret was her age when you... i
		remember the time at the river when
		we couldn't find catherine... you
		couldn't stop crying... and she was
		asleep in the wagon the entire
		time...

marion pauses, remembering.  the crash of a plate
breaking, followed by the sound of an argument rises from
the house below.  marion shakes his head with an
exasperated sigh.

				marion
		your children.

he heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from
the lights of candles and oil lamps.
