ext.  yorktown encampment - day

an intermittent exchange of cannon fire.  not a battle,
but pre-battle pot shots.  behind the american
embattlements, hundreds of american and french soldiers
drill, make camp and build secondary fortifications.

marion, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of
the british defenses.  a runner, a boy about fifteen,
dashes up to marion.

				runner
		you called for me, sir?

marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single
walnut which he hands to the boy.

				marion
		take this to general washington.

the boy looks at the walnut and then looks at marion as if
he's joking or crazy.  he's neither.  the boy shrugs and
runs off with the walnut.
