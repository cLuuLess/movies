ext.  marion's house - night

quiet.  dark.  marion stands on the front porch, looking
out into the night, listening, hearing nothing.  he
glances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes from
the big dipper to the north star.

behind the house, a figure in the darkness, carrying a
musket, moves from shadow to shadow.
