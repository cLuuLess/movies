ext.  cheraw falls - day

marion's children and charlotte sit by the river.  samuel
sits on the lookout ledge with his musket.  suddenly he
stands, looking out, seeing something.

charlotte and the others notice.  they're worried.  then
they see samuel throw down his musket and tear down the
path, running as fast as he can, tumbling, then regaining
his feet...

charlotte and the others know who's coming...

the children take off running after samuel...

racing toward the road...

charlotte hurries after them...

and then they see him...

marion, riding at a full gallop...

the children cry out with tears of joy...

marion see susan...

he gallops toward her...

leans over...

without slowing, he swoops her up into the saddle...

she wraps herself around him...

he reins back, stops and dismounts, just as the other
children reach him...

they throw themselves into his arms... embracing him...

charlotte hurries up behind them...

she and marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs
of his children.
