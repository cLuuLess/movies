ext.  black swamp road - day

marion and his men ride along a raised road that drops off
into black swamp on either side...

they round a curve and stop, reining back their horses in
confusion as they see:

fifty green dragoons heading straight toward them...

the dragoons open fire from both directions, killing
several more of marion's men, wounding others...

marion's men fire back as best they can, caught in the
chaos of bucking and falling horses and wounded and
dismounted men...

they remount, doubling-up with the wounded...

marion sees an unaided wounded man.  leaps from his
horse, heaves him onto his horse, slaps it...

marion's men head off both sides of the road into the
swamp, struggling with their mounts as they hit the knee-
deep water...

marion on foot with four men, only three horses... a
dragoon, aiming his pistol, thunders down on marion...
marion fires, killing the dragoon...

marion's men mount, one motions to marion...

				marion
		go!

marion's men ride off, leaving him alone... a dragoon is
almost on him, sword raised.  marion, his weapon spent,
sees a thick branch on the ground, two feet long... grabs
it...

the sword flashes and sinks deeply into the wood... marion
yanks, brings the rider off his horse, grabs the reins and
swings himself up into the empty saddle.  marion rides
down the embankment...

the dragoons rein back, slowed by the dead horses and men.
they spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and
follow marion and his men into the swamp...
