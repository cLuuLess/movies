ext.  small british fort - day

cornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him,
sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch
rider waits.  they're on a hillside, looking over the
burned-out remains of a small british fort as some
redcoats pull the union jack out of a trench latrine.

cornwallis motions tarleton and they ride a few yards from
the other officers and speak, out of earshot.

				cornwallis
		from general clinton in new york...
			   (reading)
		"... your request to move north is
		denied until you have properly dealt
		with your militia problem."
			   (aside)
		he underlined, 'militia'.
			   (reading)
		"you have spent over six months
		dealing with a six-week problem.  it
		is essential that you quell the
		militia..."
			   (aside)
		underlined again.
			   (reading)
		"... insurgency, particularly
		because of the likely move south of
		washington and the inevitable
		arrival of the french.  militia, as
		you have so often pointed out, is
		not worth the attention of a
		significant army, hence it is
		mystifying why militia has bedeviled
		you for so long..."

tarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show.

				cornwallis
			   (reading)
		"... it is my fervent hope that the
		vigor of your campaign comes to
		match the vigor of your
		correspondence with your
		parliamentary and court patrons.
		only then might you share in the
		victory, on the verge of which i now
		stand."
			   (beat)
		"your guardedly respectful
		commander, general sir george
		clinton."

cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to tarleton.

				cornwallis
		if i fail, you fail.

				tarleton
		perhaps.

				cornwallis
		and if i triumph, you triumph.

				tarleton
		probably.

				cornwallis
		how can we end this madness?

				tarleton
		difficult, sir.  this is, as you
		pointed out, a civil war.

cornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply.

				cornwallis
		civility is a secondary virtue.  it
		is superseded by duty.

				tarleton
		i understand, sir.

tarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, and
rides off.
