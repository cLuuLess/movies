ext.  yorktown overlook - day

the road to yorktown skirts an overlook with a view of the
town and the harbor.  a few dozen arriving patriots have
stopped to look out at the view.  marion, lee, rev. oliver
and dalton join them.

the french fleet is visible in the harbor.  the british
encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out
from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large
island.  in a semi-circle around the landward peninsula,
the beginnings of the patriot encirclement are visible.
it's a grand and impressive sight.

marion and the others turn their horses and head down the
road toward the american lines.
