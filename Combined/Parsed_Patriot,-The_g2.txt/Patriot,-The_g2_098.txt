ext.  hillside clearing - above fort carolina - day

major wilkins and a detachment of green dragoons ride up
the wooded slope toward the bound redcoat officers that
cornwallis saw through the spyglass.  as the dragoons ride

more than scarecrows in redcoat uniforms.  there's no sign
of marion or his men.
