int.  small farmhouse - day

silence.  a tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in
the floor, disappearing into a gap between two
floorboards.

marion, dalton, rev. oliver, and several other men walk
slowly through the farmhouse, in stunned silence.

marion sees the body of the mother, draped over her two
young children.  marion turns to rev. oliver who can only
stare, offering no solace.

they pass fielding's body, then enter the kitchen and see
billings, dead, still tied to the table.  marion reels.
