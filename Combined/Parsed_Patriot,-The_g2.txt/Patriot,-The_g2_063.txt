int.  cornwallis' headquarters - camden farmhouse - day

british officers, clerks and aides work.  they're in good
spirits.  lord cornwallis, a proud man, comfortable with
command, coldly notes one of his officers slapping another
on the back.  major huntington rolls out a map for
cornwallis.

				cornwallis
		gentlemen.

the officers gather around the map.

				cornwallis
		major, this is not an adequate map.

				major huntington
		we have better coming on the
		trailing supply convoy from
		charleston.

				cornwallis
		a useful place for our maps.

				major huntington
		i'm sorry, sir, it won't happen
		again.

tarleton enters, followed by wilkins.

				cornwallis
		my harrier.  join us, colonel.

				tarleton
		sir.

tarleton and wilkins join them around the map.

				cornwallis
		gentlemen, celebration is premature.
		we have a difficult campaign ahead
		of us.  we are in predominately
		hostile country and we cannot rely
		on forage.  as we move north, the
		bulk of our supplies will reach us
		by sea, through charleston, which
		will give us a long and vulnerable
		supply line, one that can only be
		secured if the locals are loyal to
		the crown.

				cornwallis' officers
			   (multiple)
		yes, sir.

cornwallis turns to his field officers, paying particular
attention to tarleton.

				cornwallis
		nonetheless, we must remember that
		this is a civil war...

tarleton proudly holds cornwallis' look.

				cornwallis
		these colonials are our brethren and
		when this conflict is over, we will
		be reestablishing commerce with
		them.  surrendering troops will be
		given quarter and unwarranted
		assaults on civilians will cease.

wilkins shifts uneasily.  tarleton isn't cowed.

				cornwallis
		i expect this war to be fought in a
		vigorous but civilized manner.

cornwallis looks at his other officers.

				cornwallis
		have i made myself clear, gentlemen?

				officers
			   (multiple)
		yes, sir.

cornwallis shifts his eyes back to tarleton who was not
among those who spoke.  tarleton pointedly pauses a
moment, then says:

				tarleton
		yes, sir.

cornwallis turns his attention back to the map.  his men
gather around.
