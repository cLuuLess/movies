ext.  assembly yard - fort carolina - day

redcoats glare at marion who sits, mounted, waiting.  his
eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and
directed to waiting horses.  surprised to be freed, they
mount up.

cornwallis and tarleton step out onto the front porch of
cornwallis' headquarters and watch as marion and his men
ride toward the gate.

the two great danes, watch marion from cornwallis' side.

cornwallis motions to the redcoat sentries to open the
gates.  they do so and marion and his men, without
hurrying, ride out.

then, just as the gates are closing behind him, marion,
without turning around, lets loose with a piercing
whistle...

the two great danes instantly race after marion, making it
through the gates just as they're closing.

cornwallis, seeing his dogs run after marion, sputters,
then turns and storms back into his quarters.

tarleton, still off-balance from marion's parting
statement, watches marion ride away.  then he turns to
major wilkins who stands nearby.

				tarleton
		take a detachment and go get our
		officers.

wilkins hurries off.
