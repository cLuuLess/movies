int.  charlotte's farmhouse - night (later)

marion stares at the fireplace.  charlotte walks in
carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing.

		they're asleep.

marion is silent.  charlotte pours water into a washbowl
and motions to marion.  he takes off his shirt.  she
begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on
his neck.

				marion

		happen?

				charlotte
		you couldn't have known.

				marion
		i should have known... once i would
		have... i used to be wary... and
		today i watched my son killed before
		my eyes... your sister civilized me
		and i damn myself for having let
		her...

				charlotte
		thomas is dead but you've done
		nothing for which you should be
		ashamed.

				marion
		i've done nothing and for that i am
		ashamed.

she looks at him closely.

				charlotte
		if you go, i'll care for them as if
		they were my own.

				marion
		i'll leave in the morning with
		gabriel.

he stares past her, looking at the flames in the
fireplace.  she tends his wounds.
