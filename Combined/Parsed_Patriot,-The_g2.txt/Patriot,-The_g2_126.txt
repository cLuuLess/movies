ext.  cheraw falls - riverside - day

marion sits on the side of the river with susan who avoids
looking at him.  using the knife we've seen him use in
battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them.

				marion
		good apple.

no response.

				marion
		very good.  sweet.

he cuts a slice and offers it to her.  she doesn't take
it.  he puts the slice between them.  after a long moment
she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops,
seeing something on it.  she puts it back.

marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red
splotch on it.  he looks at his knife and realizes that
it's dried blood.

off-balance, he turns to susan who stares straight ahead,
a thousand miles from marion.
