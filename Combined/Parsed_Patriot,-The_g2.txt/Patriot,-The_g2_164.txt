ext.  yorktown - dawn

the next day.  silence.  the battlefield, as far as the
eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men
and scattered weapons.

the british have retreated back behind their defenses but
have left many of their men on the field.

the patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their
barricades.

then, a single figure appears on one of the british
parapets.  a drummer boy, no more than ten-years-old.
behind him, a single british officer.

they boy begins to beat the drum.  the officer raises a
white flag.

in the american lines, the men see the flag.  some call
out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them marion,
simply take a deep breath.  it's finally over.
