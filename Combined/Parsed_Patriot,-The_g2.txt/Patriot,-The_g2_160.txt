ext.  yorktown - pre-dawn

marion stands at the american battlements, looking out at
the british defensive works.  above him, stars are
visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn
glow from the horizon.

marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the
north star, but in the increasingly harsh light of this
day, he can't find it.  he turns his eyes back to the
battlefield.
