int.  marion's study - night

squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as
thomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men.  gabriel
reads the new pamphlets and broadsides.  marion walks in
and pours a drink.  gabriel hands several of the pamphlets
to his father.

				gabriel
		the new york and rhode island
		assemblies have been dissolved...

				marion
		the middle colonies?

				gabriel
		rioting both sides of the bay, in
		chestertown they burned the customs
		house and tar-and-feathered the
		customs agent.  he died of burns.
		in wilmington they killed a royal
		magistrate and two redcoats.

				marion
		anything about the convention in
		philadelphia?

				gabriel
		poor richard says they'll make a
		declaration of independence by july.

marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting
a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box.  he
begins reading.

				gabriel
		scott higgins joined the militia.

marion hears but doesn't respond.  thomas looks up from
his lead soldiers.

				gabriel
		he's seventeen.  a year younger than
		i.

gabriel and thomas wait for a reaction.  there is none.
gabriel goes back to reading and thomas resumes playing
with his toy soldiers.  marion's eyes drift from the page
to gabriel.
