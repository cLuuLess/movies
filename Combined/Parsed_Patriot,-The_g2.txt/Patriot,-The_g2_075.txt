grand.  opulent.  cornwallis speaks with a small gathering
of loyalist civilians, among whom is the spectacular mrs.
talbot, who wears a daring dress that reveals an enormous
expanse of bosom.  at her side stands her toady of a
husband, mr. talbot.

				mrs. talbot
		no!  the beasts took your dogs, as
		well?

				cornwallis
		fine animals, a gift from his
		majesty.  dead now, for all i know.

				mrs. talbot
		is there no decency?

				mr. talbot
		among the rebels?  we know the
		answer to that.

				cornwallis
		yes, we have learned.
