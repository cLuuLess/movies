ext.  snow's island - day

marion's men tend their wounded and look through the
british wagons, taking inventory.

				rev. oliver
		... two-hundred-sixty-six brown bess
		muskets, forty-one casks of powder,
		balls, tamping...

				billings
		we have enough arms for an army.
		now all we need is an army.

marion checks out a wagon full of tools with dan scott and
rob fielding, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  they
overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of
colonial artisans.

				scott
		reamer, boring tool...

				marion
		swage, broach, etching tool...

				fielding
		a rolling gunsmith's shop...

				scott
		we can rifle those musket barrels...

				fielding
		get another hundred yards out of
		'em...

				marion
		we'll need a forge...

				scott
		easy enough...

				marion
		we've got clay to make a chamber...

				fielding
		oak to make charcoal...

				scott
		oil cloth and barrel staves to make
		a bellows...

				marion
		and we can yank a wagon wheel,
		weight it, rig a piston and drive
		shaft and we'll have a flywheel to
		power the bellows...

scott and fielding exchange an impressed look.

				scott
			   (to fielding)
		that's why he's a colonel.

scott and fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work.
marion hears a commotion of barking dogs and yelling men
and strides over to find billings cowering before two huge
great danes who stand guard at one of the wagons.

				billings
		shoot them!  shoot the damn things!

dalton prepares to do so.

				marion
		put that pistol down!

				scott
		they followed us from the bridge.
		they won't let anyone near the
		wagon.

marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the
dogs.

				marion
		stay... stay... stay...

the dogs waver between obeying marion and ripping out his
throat.

				marion
		don't you growl at me!

the dogs decide to obey.  marion lets them sniff his hand,
then firmly pats them.

				marion
		now let's see what's in this wagon.

rev. oliver and abner join him.  billings eases past the
dogs.  abner opens a large case and finds it filled with
bottles.

				abner
		rum, french champagne, madeira,
		port...

				billings
		no wonder they were guarding it.

gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered
wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig-
stands.  rev. oliver opens one of several identical cases
and finds it filled with papers.

				rev. oliver
		my heavens, personal correspondence
		of... lord cornwallis.

marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching
cases on nearby wagons.

				marion
		these four wagons must be his.

				gabriel
		and the dogs, too, i'll wager.

				billings
		i say we drink the wine, shoot the
		dogs, and use the papers for musket
		wadding.

				marion
		his journals, letters, maps,
		books...

abner calls from another wagon.

				abner
		colonel, we got a wagon full of
		officer's uniforms and more powder
		and muskets here.

ignoring abner, marion, sits down on a stump with a pile
of cornwallis' papers and starts to read.
