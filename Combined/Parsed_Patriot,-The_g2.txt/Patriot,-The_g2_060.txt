ext.  snow's island - santee swamps - night

a cacophony of birds and insects.  swamp maples and
willows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and pools
of plant-choked water.

gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that
snakes through the swamp.  they cross a narrow land bridge
onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men,
including marion who kneels at a campfire.

close shot:  several of thomas' brightly painted lead
soldiers melt in a cast-iron pan.  the little men fall to
their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten
metal.

the new arrivals dismount and greet the others.

gabriel steps up behind marion and watches as he pours the
lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold
into a bucket of water which hisses and steams.

				gabriel
		father, this war is about more than
		thomas.

marion doesn't look up.

				marion
		is it?

				gabriel
		if you're here only for revenge,
		you're doing a disservice to him as
		well as yourself.

				marion
		how old are you?

				gabriel
		you know how old i am.

				marion
		god help us all when you're forty.

marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan.  gabriel
shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse.
