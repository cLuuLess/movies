ext.  marion's encampment - night

a cold, winter rain falls.  most of marion's grim men are
huddled in lean-to's and around campfires.  green and
several other pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of
supplies while marion, scott and fielding stow the
provisions.

gabriel and anne sit at a fire, under the cover of a lean-
to, taking quietly.  he's troubled.  she tries to be
hopeful.

				anne
		next time we'll bring more blankets.

				gabriel
		that would be nice.

				anne
		maybe we'll be lucky this winter and
		have just rain, no snow.

				gabriel
		that would be nice, too.

she takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of
tea.

				anne
		just because the french didn't come
		this fall, doesn't mean they're
		never going to come.

he nods and takes a drink of the tea.  she smiles.
gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink-
stained, black teeth.  before she has time to laugh...

rollins rides hard into camp.  marion hurries over,
accompanied by the great danes.  the other men gather
around.

				rollins
		they're to be hung!

				gabriel
		but they're prisoners-of-war!

marion isn't as surprised as gabriel.  he is, however,
taken aback by gabriel's black teeth.  gabriel notices
everyone looking at his mouth.

anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in
the face of the troubling news.
