int.  charlotte's living room - night

marion enters.  he starts to pace but grows unsteady.  he
rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his
mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are
searching for the solace of sleep.

he opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours
and drinks.  then another.

the sound of horsemen.  gabriel walks in.  tired.  grim.

				gabriel
		how are they?

marion just shakes his head.

				gabriel
		gates is at hillsboro with the
		continental army.  i'll leave in the
		morning to join him.

marion nods.  marion and gabriel stand in silence for a
long moment, neither one finding words.  then gabriel
speaks softly.

				gabriel
		i'll tend my horse.

he leaves marion alone.
