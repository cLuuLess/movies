int.  church - pembroke village - night

marion walks in and stops dead.  at the altar of the small
sanctuary, half-a-dozen people stand with rev. oliver.  at
the center of the tiny gathering is anne green, flanked by
her parents.

				gabriel
		father, i'm looking for a best man.

marion is stunned but recovers quickly.

				marion
		i'd be honored.

they share a moment, then head down the aisle.  marion
greets anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and
bowing to her mother.  abner, at the door, nods that the
coast is clear.

				rev. oliver
		dearly beloved, we are gathered here
		in the sight of god to join this man
		and this woman in holy matrimony...

marion feels every word, looking straight ahead but
knowing that he's standing next to his son.
