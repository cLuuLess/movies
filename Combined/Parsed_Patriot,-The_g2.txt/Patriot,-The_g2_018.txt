ext.  charleston square - night

down the block from the motte house.  a yelling crowd of
sons of liberty is massed around a liberty tree from which
hang dozens of glowing lanterns.  most of the men in the
crowd are drunk.  vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners
emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, "don't
tread on me."  scores of on-lookers, including respectable
people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards,
watch the proceedings.

several sons of liberty string up effigies of king george
iii and governor wilmington.  they light the effigies on
fire.  as they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers.
