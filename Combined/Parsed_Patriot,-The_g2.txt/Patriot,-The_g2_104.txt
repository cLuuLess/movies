ext.  shanty town - night

a compound of rude shacks, built of scraps of lumber and
rough-hewn logs, stands on the side of the magpie river.

marion's men wait with the children while abner, charlotte
and gabriel, flanked by aaron and abigail, marion's
middle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence,
talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, black
freedmen.

the conversation, which is out of the children's earshot,
is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmen
particularly troubled.

marion's stone-faced children look around, appraising
their surroundings, registering the poverty of the shanty
town.

the discussion between the grown-ups ends with a guarded
exchange of handshakes.  gabriel, charlotte, abner, aaron
and abigail rejoin the children and marion's men.

				gabriel
		it's all set.

they follow aaron, down an alley to a shack.  small.
barely standing.  the children stop in their tracks,
knowing this is to be their new home.

charlotte sees their hesitation.  she walks up to the
little structure, examining it with a critical eye.  she
looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor,
wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude,
chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall.  she smiles.

				charlotte
		this will do fine.

she turns to aaron and abigail.

				charlotte
		thank you.

charlotte walks inside without looking back.  the children
hesitate, then follow her inside.
