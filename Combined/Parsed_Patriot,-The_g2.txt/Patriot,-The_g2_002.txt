ext.  pond bluff - day

a farm built between the banks of the river and the deep
green of the swamps.  good, fertile land, hacked out of
the wilderness.

the perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops,
alfalfa and tobacco.  two sturdy brothers, nathan, 13 and
samuel, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging
scythes through the barley.

the house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and
well-maintained.  there's a barn, a workshop and a forge.
it is a home of substance rather than wealth.  on the
front porch, margaret, 11, pumps a butter churn while her
brother, william, 6, watches.

gabriel, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods
with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his
shoulder.  at his side walks thomas, 14, also carrying a
musket.
