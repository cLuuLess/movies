ext.  british field headquarters - camden - day

a massive british army field encampment.  thousands of
well-armed, veteran troops.  large detachments of redcoats
march through endless rows of tents.  some are battle-
worn, others are fresh troops moving out.

tarleton and his green dragoons, covered with dirt and
sweat, ride into the encampment.  tarleton and wilkins
peel off, riding to the front of a farmhouse that has been
commandeered for british headquarters.  they dismount and
stride in.
