ext.  balcony - camden inn - night

cornwallis, taking the night air with mrs. talbot, gazes
at the moon, achieving the calculated effect.

				mrs. talbot
		you seem far away.

				cornwallis
		it's the weight of command and the
		lot of a widower -- memories,
		loneliness...
			   (with a self-
			    deprecating laugh)
		... and long gazes at the moon.

mrs. talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her
fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located
inches above her stunning cleavage.   

				mrs. talbot
		oh, you poor man...

a massive explosion lights up the night as a fireball
erupts from the armory.  british officers, including major
halbert and tarleton, rush out along with mr. talbot and
other loyalist civilians.

				major halbert
		good god!

mr. talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at
his wife, clinging to cornwallis' arm.

				mr. talbot
		these rebels seem to lack fear as
		well as decency, eh, general?

cornwallis registers the insult, glances at the hapless
major halbert, then turns to tarleton.

				cornwallis
		colonel tarleton, you deal with
		these damned rebels.

				tarleton
		yes, sir.

tarleton smiles grimly and strides off the balcony.
