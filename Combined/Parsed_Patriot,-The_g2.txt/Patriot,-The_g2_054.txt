ext.  american encampment - night

a nightmare.  screams of agony.  a few hundred battered,
patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move
out.  the battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a
distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically
painful and ugly.

marion and gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous
sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools
of blood and amputated legs and arms.  marion sees harry
lee at a make-shift command post, barking orders, trying
to pull things together.

				lee
		damn you, sergeant, don't move the
		wounded twice, put them straight on
		the wagons from the surgeons.

				patriot sergeant
		yes, sir.

				lee
		lieutenant, detail men for
		outriders.  we move out as soon as
		the wounded are ready.

				lieutenant
		yes, sir.

the lieutenant rushes off.  lee notices marion and
gabriel, surprised to see them.  he jerks his head for
them to follow him into:

lee's command tent

once out of sight of the men, lee loses his command
bearing.  exhausted, he leans on his campaign table and
looks closely at marion, asking with his eyes why marion
is here.

				marion
		green dragoons came to my home,
		killed my son, thomas.  it was
		tarleton himself.

				lee
		i'm sorry.

				marion
		i'm sorry i wasn't here for this.

				lee
		there's nothing you could have done,
		gates is a damned fool.

				marion
		we saw.

				lee
		i begged him to stay in the cover of
		the trees but he insisted the only
		way to break cornwallis was muzzle-
		to-muzzle.  he spent too many years
		in the british army.

				marion
		where is he now?

				lee
		last anyone saw, riding hard,
		northeast, his staff a hundred yards
		behind, trying to catch up.

				marion
		who's in command?

				lee
		i am, i think.

				marion
		what are my orders?

lee gives marion a tired smile.

				lee
		if you want orders, i've got some
		for you.

lee rolls out a map for marion and gabriel.

				lee
		we're a breath away from losing this
		war.  in the north, washington is
		reeling from valley forge, running
		and hiding from clinton and twelve
		thousand redcoats.
			   (pointing)
		here in the south, cornwallis has
		broken our back.  he captured over
		five thousand of our troops when he
		took charleston and today he
		destroyed the only army that stood
		between him and new york.

				marion
		so now cornwallis will head north,
		link up with clinton and finish off
		washington.

				lee
		and patriots will start dying on the
		gallows instead of the battlefield.
			   (beat)
		unless we can keep cornwallis in the
		south until the french arrive.  a
		treaty was signed at versailles
		after our victory at saratoga.  the
		french are sending a fleet and ten
		thousand troops.

				marion
		when?

				lee
		fall, six months at the earliest.

				marion
		long time.

				lee
		the bigger problem is where, not
		when.  the french fleet won't sail
		north of the chesapeake for fear of
		early storms.

				marion
		so you're going to try to keep
		cornwallis in the south until then.

				lee
		not me, you.  i'm going north with
		every continental regular i can find
		to reinforce washington or he won't
		last six weeks.

				marion
		you expect cornwallis to be held
		here by militia?

				lee
		not held, just slowed down.

				marion
		they're nothing but farmers and
		you're asking them to try to keep a
		tiger in their backyard.  they'd be
		better off letting it move on.

				lee
		they'd be better off, but the cause
		wouldn't be.

				marion
		how many men does cornwallis have
		under his command?

				lee
		four thousand infantry and around
		six hundred cavalry...
			   (beat)
		... including the green dragoons
		under tarleton.

at the mention of tarleton, marion nods.

				marion
		i'll do what i can.

lee quickly writes something.

				lee
		i'm giving you a field commission as
		a colonel.

he hands it to marion.  gabriel steps forward.

				gabriel
		colonel lee, i request a transfer to
		colonel marion's command.

				lee
		granted.

lee scribbles another order and hands it to gabriel.  then
he turns to marion.

				lee
		good luck.

marion nods.  they duck out of the tent.
