int.  parlor - charlotte's house - day

marion watches as charlotte finishes handing out presents.
susan plays with a new doll.  william has half-a-dozen new
spinning tops, skimming around the floor.  margaret holds
a new dress up to herself.  samuel, nathan and thomas tear
into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers.  gabriel
looks through a new book.

charlotte sees marion watching her, rises and joins him at
the doorway.

				marion
		you look well, charlotte.

				charlotte
		as do you.

suddenly thomas and samuel race through the doorway,
forcing marion and charlotte together, their bodies close.
they step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles.

the moment is broken by the sound of children.  marion and
charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.
