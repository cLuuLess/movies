ext.  shack - shanty town - night

dark.  quiet.  gabriel and anne wait in the shadows while
marion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walks
slowly toward the shack.

he warily checks every shadow.  no one anywhere.  then a
sound -- a squeal of laughter, immediately followed by:

				margaret (o.s.)
		it's him!  i told you it was him!

marion's children race out of the shadows to marion.  he's
practically bowled over as margaret, nathan, samuel and
william fling themselves into his arms.

				nathan
		father!

				william
		papa...

charlotte steps out of the shadows, watching the reunion
as marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug
all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll
never let go.  marion and charlotte lock eyes over the
heads of the children.

				marion
		thank you.

charlotte smiles.  then marion notices susan peeking out
from behind charlotte's patched and mended skirt.  he
kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't
move.

he smiles to her and speaks softly:

				marion
		susan...

she looks coldly at marion, tightens her grip on
charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her.  marion
looks to charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance.
then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces
of his other children.
