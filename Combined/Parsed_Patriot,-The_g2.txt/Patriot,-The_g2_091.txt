int.  cornwallis' headquarters - fort carolina - day

a temporary hq has been set up in a commandeered
farmhouse.  cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor
measures him and marks alterations on a partially
completed uniform.  tarleton enters.

				tarleton
		general, a message from the
		commander of the rebel militia.

cornwallis reads the message.

				cornwallis
		it seems our swamp fox wants to have
		a formal parley.

				tarleton
		are you going to meet with him?

				cornwallis
		most certainly.  arrange it.
