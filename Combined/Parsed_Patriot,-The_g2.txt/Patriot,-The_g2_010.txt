int.  girls' bedroom - night

marion steps to the doorway, finding margaret and susan at
the window, looking up at the night sky.

				margaret
		... now count five finger lengths up
		from the front two stars of the big
		dipper, and that's the north star,
		that's her.

susan gazes up at the north star.  the girls notice marion
and climb into bed.  he puts a chair against susan's bed
and kisses her.  he pulls a blanket up around margaret,
who whispers:

				margaret
		it helps her to know mother's there.

marion nods with a thin smile, kisses margaret and walks
out.
