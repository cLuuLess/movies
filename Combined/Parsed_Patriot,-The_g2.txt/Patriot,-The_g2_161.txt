ext.  yorktown battlefield - day

the sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility
to a few dozen yards.  men move like ghosts.

the camera finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist.
there is no overview, just separate detachments:

an orderly regiment of continental cavalry, mounted,
waiting, steadying their horses.

two long lines of continental infantry reserves...

an american command, including washington, lafayette and
two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and
runners...

and, finally, marion and his men, who stand in the middle
of a long line of patriot militia in the center of a long,
valley-line depression.

they stand silently, unable to see anything other than
each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass
in front of them.

they're all grim.  they know what's coming.

then, the sound of a single drum, heard but unseen, coming
from over the slope...

then, more drums, more and more, a competition of drum
beats...

marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to
imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in
front of them.

marion motions for his officers, dalton, scott, rev.
oliver and several other patriot militia officers from
other units.  they quickly gather around.   

				marion
		the british army believes in
		officers.  i believe in soldiers.
		after we engage, there will be no
		more orders.  every man here must
		know what i'm about to tell you.

they listen closely.

				marion
		we are the bait in a trap.  we're
		militia.  cornwallis thinks we're
		rabble, nothing more than a bunch of
		undisciplined farmers.  and if he
		thinks that's what we are, that's
		what we're going to give him.
		listen up.

they gather around closer.
