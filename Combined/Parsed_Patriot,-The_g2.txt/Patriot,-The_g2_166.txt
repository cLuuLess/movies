ext.  yorktown - day

the surrender ceremony continues.  marion, on the fringe
of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to
leave.  lee walks out of the crowd and joins him.  they
lock eyes for a moment, then marion mounts up.

				lee
		goodbye, francis.

				marion
		goodbye, harry.

marion reaches down.  they shake hands.

				marion
		and congratulations on the birth of
		your son.

				lee
		thank you.  maybe all of this will
		buy him some peace.

				marion
		i hope so.

as marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops,
speaking back to lee over his shoulder.

				marion
		your son, what did you name him?

				lee
		robert.  robert e. lee.

marion smiles.

				marion
		a good name for a farmer.

lee nods.  marion rides off.
