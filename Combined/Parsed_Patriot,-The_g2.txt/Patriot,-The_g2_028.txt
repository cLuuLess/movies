ext.  front porch - marion's house - dawn

marion steps out to his front porch and listens.  he knows
the sound, the distant staccato booms of cannon and the
pattering wave of thousands of muskets firing.

one by one the children join him.  thomas, nathan and
samuel listen analytically.  margaret and susan press
close against their father.  william looks curiously at
the cloudless sky.

				william
		is it going to rain?

				thomas
		that's not thunder.

the sound becomes deeper, more ominous.  they all notice
the change.

				nathan
		father?

				marion
		six-pounders.  lots of them.

				margaret
		how far away?

				marion
		four, five miles.

				samuel
		waxhaus?

				marion
		just east of it.

				margaret
		are we safe here?

marion puts on a smile.

				marion
		don't worry.

				margaret
		we could go stay at aunt charlotte's
		farm.  she's to the west.

				marion
		no, there'll be skirmishers on the
		roads.  we're safer here.

thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets.  he
gives one to nathan and offers the other to his father.

				marion
		put those away.

				thomas
		but father, they might come this
		way.

				marion
		put them away.

reluctantly, thomas takes the muskets back into the house.

				marion
		enough.  i'll be in the workshop.
		samuel, the cows.  thomas, attend to
		your studies here on the porch.
		nathan, on the back porch.  if you
		see anyone, come get me.  margaret,
		please keep william close to you.
		no one is to go past the yard wall.

they all nod.  marion walks off toward the workshop,
followed by susan.  the others hesitate.

				marion
		children.

they head off to do as they were told.
