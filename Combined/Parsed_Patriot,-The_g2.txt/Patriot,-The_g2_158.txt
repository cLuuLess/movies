ext.  yorktown hilltop - day

washington's officers who include harry lee, colonel
alexander hamilton, lafayette, general pinkney, and
various other aides and junior officers reach the crest of
the hill and wait for washington and marion who trail a
bit behind them, talking privately, eating walnuts as they
go.

while they wait, the officers look out at the view, seeing
the puffs of smoke of intermittent cannon fire.

washington and marion

finish the walnuts.  they stop for a moment to catch their
breath.

				washington
		i was sorry to hear about your son.

				marion
		i lost another a year ago, thomas.
		he was only fifteen.

				washington
		i've had no sons to lose, nor
		daughters.
			   (beat)
		i lose the sons of other men.

they look out at the vista, knowing that they're looking
at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men.

				washington
		life was easier when we only had
		ourselves to get killed.

they walk on, joining the others on the crest of the hill.
the officers are looking out, some with spyglasses, at
the british emplacements.

				washington
		gentlemen, what do we see?

				hamilton
		mortars, center, with two lines of
		enfilading trenches.

				pinkney
		more along the right flank and
		behind the forward redoubts.

				lafayette
		a formidable defensive position.
		very formidable.

				hamilton
		they could hold out for weeks.

washington nods and turns to marion.

				washington
		francis, tell me about general
		cornwallis.

				marion
		remember braddock?

				washington
		that bad?

				marion
		worse.

				washington
		proud, priggish and competent.  a
		very bad combination in an
		adversary.

washington sighs.

				washington
		for those of you who don't know, we
		intercepted a british dispatch this
		morning.  general clinton has sailed
		from new york to relieve cornwallis.

that hits washington's officers hard.

				hamilton
		how long before they arrive?

				washington
		less than a week.  sixteen ships and
		over nine thousand redcoats.

				lafayette
		sooner or later that message will
		get through to cornwallis.

				pinkney
		and when it does, he'll just wait us
		out.

				washington
		and when the british ships arrive,
		the french ships will flee.  and
		when the french ships flee, general
		rochambeau and the french troops
		will flee as well.

marion speaks up.

				marion
		then you must let the message go
		through.

they all turn to marion, most of them looking at him as if
he's insane.

				washington
		if cornwallis receives news that
		clinton is coming, he'll simply hold
		tight and wait.  he'll fight a
		purely defensive battle and he'll
		win that.

				marion
		no, he won't.  there are two things
		you need to know about cornwallis.
		first, he is a very proud man, he
		would rather risk defeat than share
		a victory.
			   (beat)
		if you give him what he thinks is an
		out, he'll take it.

				washington
		and what is the second thing?

marion pulls cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and
leafs through it.

				marion
		i'll let him tell you himself...
			   (reading)
		"... but it is this colonial militia
		that is the most irksome.  not
		worthy of my attention, but
		demanding it; not worthy of british
		blood, but taking it; and not worthy
		of a soldier's honor, but sullying
		it.  those nights of mine that are
		not sleepless, are filled with
		dreams of a cavalry charge on the
		heels of fleeing farmers..."

marion closes the journal.

				marion
		he has no respect for citizen
		soldiers.  that's your bait...
		militia.

washington nods, considering it.
