ext.  deeper in the swamps - night

darker still.  tarleton and his men come to a dead end,
blocked by a heavy tangle of huge swamp ferns and thorn
bushes.

they rein back their horses, stopping in a confused mess.
tarleton calls to gaskins and the loyalist scouts.

				tarleton
		which way?

				gaskins
		this way... no this... i think...

tarleton makes his own choice... rides off... the green
dragoons follow, the loyalists bring up the rear.
