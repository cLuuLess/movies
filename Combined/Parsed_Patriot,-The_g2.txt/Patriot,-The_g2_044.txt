ext.  hilltop - pond bluff - day

marion digs a grave.  the children watch.  the only sounds
are marion's labored breathing, the rasp of the shovel and
the rustle of dead leaves blown along the ground by a soft
wind.

some dry leaves catch on thomas' still wet blood, as if
trying to bandage his wound.
