int.  marion's house - evening

pre-dinner chaos.  everyone talking at once.  marion's
seven children and his two family servants, abigail and
aaron, a middle-aged black couple, prepare dinner.  susan
silently watches from the stairs.  marion walks in.

		plate...

marion hands the apples to abigail and steps over to open
his mail and dispatches.

letter.

the children erupt into cheers and thunder into the dining
room.

				the children
		charleston!  we're going to
		charleston!

marion and gabriel exchange a stone-faced look.  then
marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply.

				marion
		i love turnips...

marion follows his children into the dining room.
