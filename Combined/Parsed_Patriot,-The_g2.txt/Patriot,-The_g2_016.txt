ext.  charlotte's house - charleston - day

grand.  four stories.  marion and his children pull up.
charlotte motte hurries out.  she's in her mid-thirties,
beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as
best she can.

the children leap from the carriages and swarm around her,
embracing her, smothering her with kisses.

				the children
		aunt charlotte!  aunt charlotte!

				charlotte
		welcome!  welcome!  margaret,
		william, look at you...!
			   (to marion)
		they're huge.  what have you been
		feeding them?

				marion
		they're from good stock on their
		mother's side.

				charlotte
		thank you.

charlotte hustles the children toward the door.

				charlotte
		come, come, inside, wait until you
		see what i have...

				the children
			   (simultaneous)
		presents!  for me?  what do you
		have?

				charlotte
		inside, inside...

charlotte sweeps past marion who smiles and follows her
into the house.
