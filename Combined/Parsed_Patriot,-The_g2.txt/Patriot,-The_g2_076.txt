int./ ext.  camden armory - night

marion and scott shove their chisels through the door
which falls away from the hinges.  they all duck inside
finding barrels and casks of gunpowder, boxes of weapons
and hundreds of muskets.

gabriel and the others load themselves up with the best of
the weapons as marion opens a cask and pours a trail of
gunpowder across the floor.
