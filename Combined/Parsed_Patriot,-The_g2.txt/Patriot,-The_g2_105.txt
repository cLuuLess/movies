int.  shack - shanty town - night

the children help aaron and abigail make beds out of
armloads of hay.  outside, charlotte and gabriel talk
quietly.

				charlotte
		so he's the one they talk about, the
		swamp fox.

				gabriel
		yes.

				charlotte
		i thought it might be him, the bits
		and pieces we heard, a veteran,
		fought in the french and indian war,
		knows the swamps.

				gabriel
		they won't stop looking for you and
		the children.

				charlotte
		we'll be alright, here, for now.
			   (beat)
		how is he?

gabriel searches for an honest answer.

				gabriel
		i don't know... i'm his son.

gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack and
pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to charlotte.

				gabriel
		these are for you and the children.

they sense someone behind them.

				susan
		why didn't father come?

gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his
heretofore silent sister.  charlotte nods, smiling.

				charlotte
		speaking for months now.

				susan
		why didn't he come?

				gabriel
		he wanted to, susan, but he couldn't
		leave his men.

				susan
		he left us.

				gabriel
		i know he did and he's sorry.  he'll
		come back as soon as he can.

susan says nothing.  gabriel continues, hopefully.

				gabriel
		there are some letters here from
		him.  some are just to you.

				susan
		i don't care.  i hate him.

				gabriel
		you don't hate him.

				susan
		yes, i do.  i hate him and i hope he
		never comes back.

gabriel kneels down and embraces her.  she stands coldly
with her arms at her sides.
