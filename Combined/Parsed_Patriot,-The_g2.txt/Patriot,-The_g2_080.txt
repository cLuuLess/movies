ext.  carolina road - day

a patchwork of fields with a village visible in the
distance.  the rollins boys, 10 and 12, work a field,
harvesting grain.  hearing the sound of horses' hooves,
they stop and listen.

then they see a cloud of dust rising over the ridge line.
growing excited, they throw down their scythes and race
down the hillside, madly stumbling and falling, trying to
intersect the approaching sound.

at the bottom of the hill they pass their father, ben
rollins, who watches his sons plant themselves on the side
of the road, gazing in awe at:

marion and his men, thundering by.  they're an impressive
sight, a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men, on powerful
mounts, raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the
road.
