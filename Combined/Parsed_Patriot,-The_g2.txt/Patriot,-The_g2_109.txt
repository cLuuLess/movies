ext.  church - night

in the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom say
goodbye to the wedding party.  anne talks quietly with her
parents.  marion and gabriel talk nearby.

				gabriel
		sir, i'd like to request a furlough.
		two days?

				marion
		granted.  where are you going?

				gabriel
		cheraw falls.

				marion
		it's beautiful there.  your mother
		and i were there once, before you
		were born.

				gabriel
		i know.

they're silent for a moment.

				marion
		she would have been pleased.

gabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarily
checking his pack ropes.  anne joins them.  marion
embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss.

				anne
		i'm sorry we didn't give you more
		warning.

				marion
		it's alright.  i'm very happy for
		you.

he helps her mount up.  abner, on guard near the road,
motions them on.  they all watch as gabriel and anne ride
off.
