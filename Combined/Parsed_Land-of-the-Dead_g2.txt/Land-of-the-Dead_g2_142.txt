      riley leaps down. the instant he's clear...



      ka-blooooooooooooom. the electrified fences are blown apart.



       n the dissipating smoke, riley is the first one through the
      opening. within seconds, citizens start toward it, heading
      the other way. riley finds himself running against the tide.
      searching. desperately searching. behind the surging crowd...



      ...walkers appear, grabbing people. dropping them to the
      ground. eating them.



       iley fires in all directions. walkers drop around him. he       
      saves a woman with a baby...a young couple...a priest. click.    
      he runs out of ammo. walkers close in. the situation seems       
      hopeless until...
