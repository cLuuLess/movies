     the t-bird rumbles along a road lined with large homes, once     
     prized for their panoramic views. riley's "game boy" beeps.
     the display shows the red dot moving along a map.

              cholo's moving out. looks like he's                     
              heading right for us.

     slack pulls into a driveway, stopping the t-bird in the         
     shadow of one of the houses.
