     kaufman paces with a cigar, passing sutherland, styles,
     and cliff.




                          aufman

              i recognize that some of you are
              concerned. we've been threatened by
              a disgruntled employee. i've sent
              people out to take care of the
              problem. however, should something
              go wrong, i want to assure you that
              measures have been taken. i've
              established outposts. with food and
              supplies to support us on our way.

                        c


                         liff

              on our way? to where?




                        kaufman

              alternate sites have been chosen.
              air transport has been arranged.
              for us and our families. as well as
              necessary support personnel.




                        cliff

              what about all the others?



     kaufman looks at cliff, as if expecting him to understand.




                         aufman

              all the others can be replaced.
               y others.




                         liff

              but...




                        kaufman

              cliff, let me talk to you for a
              moment.



     kaufman leads cliff into...




                                                      51.










...an alcove on the far side of the room, shutting two pocket
doors made of sandblasted glass. sutherland and the others      
can't hear, but can see, kaufman and cliff in silhouette.       
on the other side of the doors: kaufman leans close to cliff,   
smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.                   

                   kaufman (cont'd)

         you interrupted me. i was just                         
         talking about how people can be
         replaced. you don't want to be
         replaced, do you?




                   cliff


         (

          nervous) no.




                    kaufman

         no, and i don't want to replace
         you. you have promise. a day may
         come when you earn yourself some
         responsibilities. right now, the
         responsibilities are mine. all                         
         the responsibilities. it was my                        

                                                                

         ingenuity that took an old world
         and made it into something new. i                      
         put up fences to make it safe. i                       
         hired soldiers and paid for their
         training. i keep the people on the
         streets away from us by giving them
         their games and vices. it costs me
         money! but i spend it because the
         responsibility is mine! now do you                     

                                                                

         understand "responsibility"?




                   cliff

         yes, but...




                    kaufman

         no buts.




                    cliff

         but...



kaufman looks disappointed. taking cliff by the arm, smiling
again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. an
armed security guard stands in the corridor outside.




                   kaufman

         take him out with the rest of the
         garbage. i won't be needing this
         man anymore.

     at the conference table, sutherland sees the light coming in
     from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as
     the security guard drags cliff away.

                        s


                         utherland

              (to styles) pretty soon it's going
              to be one of us.
