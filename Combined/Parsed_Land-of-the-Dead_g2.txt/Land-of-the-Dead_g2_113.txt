      riley jumps out onto the street where cholo lies, bleeding      
      from the top of his left shoulder.                              

                         cholo                                        

               i hate you, riley. there's                             
               something about you i've always                        
               fucking hated.                                         

                         riley                                        

               (smiling) same here.                                   

                         slack                                        

               riley. look out there.

riley looks where slack is pointing. from across the river      
comes a flickering orange glow.                                 
riley moves to a spot where he can see between the houses on
the hillside. in the distance, fire rises from the city.        
cholo sits up, cackling.                                        

                   cholo

         i didn't have to blow the fucking                      
         place up. somebody else did for me!                    

                   riley                                        

         (stunned) the stenches. they got                       
         across the river. they got across                      
         the fucking river. (to the others)                     
         get him inside.                                        
pillsbury steps in and lifts cholo easily to his feet.          




                                                                


                   cholo

         wait, wait, wait. what are we                          
         doin'? where we goin'?                                 

                   riley                                        

         back to the city.                                      

                   cholo

         not this horse. you got the t-bird?                    

                                                                

         i'll take that.




                    foxy                                        


                                                                

         me, too.



foxy jumps out of dead reckoning and stands at cholo's side.    
riley, slack, and pillsbury climb aboard. riley looks down at   
cholo and foxy.                                                 

                   riley                                        

         you guys'd be safer coming with us.                    

                   cholo                                        

         nah, you'd never let me have any                       
         fun.                                                   

                   riley                                        

         t-bird's down that driveway over                       
         there. guns and ammo inside.                           

                    cholo                                       

         thanks.
