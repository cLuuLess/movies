     riley and his team wait in the shadows of the driveway they     
     pulled into. they hear the distant growl of dead reckoning.     

                                                                     

     looking over a hedge-row, riley can see high beams advancing.




                        riley

                        riley

              riley'd never do that. just look at                     
              him, you can tell he'd never do that.                   

                        riley

              get in, i'll try to leave one open.                     
     riley takes off. charlie looks torn. he wants to go with
     riley, but he has to keep pillsbury and manolete covered.        

                        pillsbury

     pillsbury, moving fast for a big woman, pounds manolete's        
     temple with a mighty fist. he drops like a lead weight.
