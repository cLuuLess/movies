     one of the dead topples face first into the water, dropping
     out of sight. another falls. big daddy looks at the spot        
     where his brothers fell in. he looks for a long time, cocking   
     his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind.         
     the first dead thing slowly rises out of the water. then the    
     second. they stand, waist deep, in the shallows.                
     big daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. then,     
     with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall.      
     hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. standing,    
     waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one    
     good hand. sniffs it. tastes it.                                
     he looks up. sees the city lights reflected on the river. he    
     tries to express his thoughts. all that comes from his mouth    
     is a series of inarticulate moans. he's incapable of            
     transmitting his idea. so he does what he's been doing since    
     uniontown. he leads. he walks toward the city. out of the       
     shallows. into deep water. over his head.
