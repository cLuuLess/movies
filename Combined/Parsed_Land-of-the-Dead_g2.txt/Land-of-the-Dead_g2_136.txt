      ext. near the "throat" - night

       iley runs out of a line of trees. in the distance, he sees...



      ...the "throat", where much of the city's population is
      trapped, herded by hundreds of walking dead against the layers
      of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them.
      there's no escape. people are being torn apart and eaten. the 
      fencing sparks as bodies touch it and are electrocuted.
      terrible screams fill the air.

      riley hears the distinctive roar of dead reckoning's engines,
      the clatter of its treads. he moves toward the sound as...



       ..a dead thing looms three feet away. riley lifts his pistol
      and puts a shell through the thing's skull. blood flies,
      taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is backlit by...



      ...the glare of dead reckoning's approaching headlights. the
      dead thing falls to the road, where...



      ...it is turned to apple butter by dead reckoning's enormous
      treads. riley stands right in the vehicle's path.
