    ...the three dead things move up the hillside with more            
    determination.

              glancing at mike's guns) you any

             dunno. it's my first trip. never                          
             had to use `em before.

              great. i'm out here with a guy who
              can't shoot. let's go.



     mike stands, turns, and...                                       
     ...is grabbed from behind by a zombie! it's not one of the       
     three they've been watching. this one wears the remains of a     
     clown suit. half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away.       
     painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. its orange hair is    
     crawling with spiders. it wrestles mike to the ground. opens     
     its lipsticked mouth. is about to bite mike's neck when...       
     ...riley fires his .45. blam! a bullet shatters the clown's      
     shoulder cap. the dead thing is pitched backward, but seems
     to feel no pain. it hunkers over mike again.




                                                                      

      iley fires four more times. three bullets rip into the
     clown's chest, neck, cheek. finally, the fourth punches a        
     hole above the thing's left eyebrow. the clown drops.            
      ike looks at riley.
