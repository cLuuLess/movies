     the white moving van pulls up to a supermarket. the dead         
     things in the parking lot, gazing at the fireworks, barely
     notice the vehicle. marksmen keep the lot covered as             
     guerillas carry cases of canned goods out of the supermarket
     and into the van. the team has this down to a science.           
      iley's voice comes over one guerilla's hand-held radio.

              how's the food?

              (into his radio) lousy, but there's
              lots of it.
