    the doors of a beat-up white moving van open. cholo reaches
    in, throwing back an oilcloth that covers another crate.           

                       guerilla

             whole lotta trash this week.                              

                       cholo                                           

             that's life, brother. a whole                             
             lotta trash.



    as the men tip the crate onto a dolly, maggots are revealed        

                                                                       

    in the darkness beneath, squirming in a pool of blood.
    (what's in that crate?)
