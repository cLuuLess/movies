     dead reckoning, emitting tendrils of hot steam from twenty       
     steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in         
     outdoor yard. (we don't see how big the yard is. yet.) a         
     searchlight sweeps the darkness as guerillas unload the
     supplies they took from uniontown and carry them toward...       
     ...a set of rusty steel doors, above which is a faded sign       
     that reads "subway (to city)".                                   
     in the bustle of activity, harry, the biker who was attacked
     in town, perspires as he helps unload. he looks ill.             
     riley walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men.        

                        riley


                                                                      

              harry. beer?



     harry doesn't answer.                                            

                        riley (cont'd)                                

              harry?                                                  
     harry spins! growls! lunges at riley like a beast!               
     riley has no time to reach for his gun. the harry-thing is
     strangling him. smashing the neck of a beer bottle on the        
     snout of dead reckoning, riley jams the jagged glass into        

                                                                      

     the harry-thing's forehead. its body drops to the ground.




                        pretty boy                                    


                                                                      

              got knocked off his bike in town.
              must have been bit.                                     
     riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret.
