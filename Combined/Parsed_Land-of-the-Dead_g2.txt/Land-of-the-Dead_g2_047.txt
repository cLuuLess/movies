                        gus

              double or nothing?




                        barrett

              sure.



     gus aims his rifle at the jerking head of tony baloney. as he    
     is about to fire, there's a sound at his back.




                        gus

              quit scratching around back there.
              you're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.




                        barrett

              i'm just standin' here. i'm not
              doin' nothing.



     the sound comes again. from the woods that adjoin the lot.
     barrett grabs the handles of a klieg light mounted on a pivot    
     and swings it so that it illuminates the tree-line.

     t                                                                

      here's nothing there. nothing but branches being slapped by     
     erratic gusts of wind.



     barrett pivots the klieg light back to its original position,
     jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals...    
     a dead thing within arm's length.

     barrett fires! the dead thing drops out of frame, replaced by    
     another. blam! barrett shoots again. this creature collapses.    
     it is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as...        
     blam! the top of barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot.    
     the rifle was fired by big daddy. the barrel is still smoking.   
     in the darkness behind him stands number nine. behind number     
     nine are the shuffling shadows of many more dead things.         

     gus screams.
