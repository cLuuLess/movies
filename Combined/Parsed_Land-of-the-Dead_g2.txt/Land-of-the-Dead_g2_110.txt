      int. kaufman's penthouse - fiddler's green - night

      kaufman rushes in with his bags, dropping them beside other     
      luggage that is already packed.

               (frightened) mister kaufman, sir. i                    
               dunno what's happening, sir, but it                    
               sounds bad.

      the windows are sealed so the noise kaufman hears is muffled,   
      but it is definitely the sound of disorder. he goes to a        
      window. looks down and sees...                                  
      ...flashes of light from gunfire. smoke rising from an          
      explosion. people running. the dead swarming into the city      
      like ants. a war has begun.
