     ext. main street - uniontown - night


12                                                               12

     dead things stand completely frozen in the middle of main        
     street, like statues, mesmerized by the fireworks.               
     only one figure is moving. big daddy. he weaves between his
     brothers and sisters, urgently waving his one good hand,         
     like frankenstein's monster, as if to say "bad! bad!" he has     
     learned that fireworks bring danger.

     a dead teenage cheerleader, holding filthy pom-poms, looks at   
     big daddy, unable to grasp what he's trying to communicate.     
     a spear is driven through the cheerleader's face! the spear     
     is held like a lance by harry, a guerilla who roars past on     
     his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round-up. other        
     bikers rumble down the street, firing guns.                     
     big daddy watches the cheerleader fall. it throws its head      
     back and lets out a great howl.
