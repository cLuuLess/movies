     a tv monitor broadcasts views of a kitchen, a plush living

              it is nice.                                            
     holding his case of dom perignon and his box of cohibas,        
     cholo looks with foxy at a monitor mounted to a white-tiled     
     subway station wall. down the tunnel behind them, the other     
     guerillas unload supplies from cargo carriers parked on the     
     platform. a sign reads, "golden triangle/fiddler's green".

         (approaching) cholo.                                   
foxy moves away, leaving riley and cholo alone.

         two people dead. that kid, mike. he

         i didn't kill him. he got bit and
         he killed himself. same thing i
         woulda done. and you!



 iley lunges at cholo, takes hold of his shirt, and slams       
him against the wall.




                   riley

         the fuck are you turning into, man?                    

                   cholo

          e take money to do nasty shit.
         shit that nobody else is dumb
         enough to do. we go in knowing the
         risks. the kid did too. his number
         came up, that's all.

         we take the risk to bring in things                    
         people need. not to make a few
         extra bucks selling liquor. you                        
         used to know that.                                     

                   cholo

         everybody makes their own way.
          verybody makes their own
          ucking way!



 holo shrugs out of riley's grasp. behind them, the guerillas   
continue to unload cargo.                                       

                   cholo (cont'd)

          y daddy...he picked fruit, penny-
         a-piece. he never went for
         anything, so he never had anything.
         i'm gonna have a place, riley. my                      
         own place! and now i got enough                        
         money to buy my way in.

     cholo looks up at the tv monitor. riley follows his gaze,           
     seeing well-dressed people sipping cocktails in a club room.




                         iley

              you're dreaming, cholo. they'd
              never let me in. they'll never let
              you in. we're the wrong kind.



     the image on the tv monitor changes to an overhead view of
     the city and its rivers. animation draws a red line along the       
     base of the "golden triangle", a zone known as "the throat".

              protected not only by its natural                          
              boundaries, but by hand-picked                             
              members of its own private militia.
