int. zoo - entrance - late afternoon

o.d. stu doesn't even stop at the ticket window. he vaults over the
turnstile, knocking benefit guests aside. the surgeons aren't far
behind. they race up to the ticket window -

                           surgeon
            did you see a corpse running this way?

the ticket-taker shrugs and points off in o.d. stu's direction.
