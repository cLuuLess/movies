int. hospital - waiting room - night

dead on her feet, julie stumbles toward the exit. as she's leaving she
passes the waiting room -

                           woman's voice
            julie?

she turns and sees an older colleague from work - alice - waiting in the
doorway. hovering right behind alice is herb. and behind him -

it appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of julie
and stu's. disheveled and groggy, they rouse themselves and make their
way over to julie's side. she's overcome with emotion.
