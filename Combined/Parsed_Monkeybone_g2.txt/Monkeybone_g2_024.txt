int. bathroom - later - night

a limp julie soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. on
the vanity is a framed photo strip, four poses for a dollar. in the
first three, stu and julie are making outrageously goony faces. in the
fourth, they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from american gothic.

she gazes at it for a long, long time. eventually she smiles.
