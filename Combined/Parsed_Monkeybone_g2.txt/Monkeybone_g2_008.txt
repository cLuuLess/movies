int. alcove - off lobby - continuous

there's nothing "cool" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal
fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.

                           stu
            see these doors? the cool thing is, you go out
            ...they close...you can't get back in!

he opens one door and holds it for julie.

                           julie
            you want to leave? but stu - you're a big hit!
            everyone loves you!

                           stu
            they don't love me. they love monkeybone.

                           julie
            it was you who got the standing o. it was you
            drawing on the belly over there...

                           stu
            that was especially monkeybone. come on, doc, i
            don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of
            media creeps. i just want to be us. home. alone!
                 (conspiratorially)
            i have something i have to give you.

                           julie
            can't you give it to me later?

                           stu
            yeah, i could, but the thing is, if later got
            here sooner, it would be...better.

he gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. for a
moment they completely forget about the party in the next room.

then herb appears behind them, trying to catch stu's eye as he waits for
the clinch to break up. finally he pries them apart:

                           herb
            sorry, julie - won't be a minute. now stu - i
            know you don't like the idea, but you really
            ought to talk to these guys -

                           stu
            julie and i - we were just gonna go...

but before stu knows what's hit him, herb is leading him back to -
