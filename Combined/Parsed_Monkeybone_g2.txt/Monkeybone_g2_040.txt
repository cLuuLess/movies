int. stu's private room - night

the real julie awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own.

                           julie
            stu!!!!

only now does she realize where she is. she's fallen asleep in the
visitor's chair next to stu's bed. the clock on the wall reads 1:15 am.

stu's readouts are spiking like crazy.
