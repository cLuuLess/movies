ext. field of flowers (nightmare orb) - day

paisley-shirted stu pours champagne for two. toasts his beloved - who
is, of course, julie, the dreamer of the dream.

he pulls out a little velvet ring box and offers it to her. but when she
tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and steals a kiss.

suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together
through the flowers, laughing, full of joy.
