ext. trainyard - that moment - night

the boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard. behind them, reapers
are shepherding a line of newly arrived dead people past a sign which
reads: "processing - this way."

by the time they can dust themselves off, an alarm starts blaring.
reapers drop what they're doing, point at the boys. panic time!

nearby, a flying bicycle is propped up against a sign. side-by-side they
race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch,
yanking each other back and forth in a tug-of-war.

stu's bigger. he pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and monkeybone with
it. they grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off -

- revealing the sign it was leaning against: "cycle repair."
