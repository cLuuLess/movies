ext. trainyard - on bicycle

monkeybone covers both eyes and wails in fear. but stu is rattling the
ignition switch, making one last effort to get the bike aloft...

the engine catches. trailing black fumes, the bicycle rises! the reapers
converge in its path, and raise their scythes...

but the bike just manages to clear the tangle of scythes - leaving the
reapers slicing at empty air!
