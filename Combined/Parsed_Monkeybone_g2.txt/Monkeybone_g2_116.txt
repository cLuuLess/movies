ext. zoo - grounds - day

julie has arrived at the zoo. she's wandering zombie-like through the
food court, flanked by her friends alice and clarissa.

                           julie
            whatever he's done, i'm responsible for it.

                           clarissa
            that's not true, julie. it's not true.

                           alice
            this is not about your guilt, julie. there could
            be innocent people in danger.

                           clarissa
            he's not the same guy. he's not your stu.
                 (beat)
            i didn't want to tell you this, but the other
            day he pinched me on the butt.

                           alice
            i didn't want to tell you this, but the other
            day he tried to mount me from behind! look, you
            have to tell the police.

                           julie
            tell them what? i don't know anything concrete.
            all i have is a feeling.

all of a sudden, they hear shouts and laughter from the area of the
reptile house. in the distance, zoo security guards are chasing a naked
man through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers.

                           clarissa
            oh my god, we've got a flasher.

                           julie
            that...that's herb!

the guards catch hold of herb and drag him away past julie, alice, and
clarissa. he doesn't recognize any of them. he's psychotic:

                           herb
            clothes! beware of clothes. they're working
            together. all of them. shirts...pants...
            ensembles...!

the three women exchange looks of stupefied horror.
