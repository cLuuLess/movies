int. house - studio - day

o.d. stu rushes frantically from room to room.

                           o.d. stu (o.s.)
            doc? doc?? - julie?

no reply - the joint's empty. o.d. stu enters the studio and spots a
newspaper on his drafting table. the paper is folded back to a big
display ad for the benefit: "meet stu miley and monkeybone - 8 pm
tonight!" he checks the wall clock: time is short.

reaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a tackle
box which contains old brushes...and a small velvet box. o.d. stu opens
the velvet box to reveal grandma's antique ring.

he hears growling behind him - it's buster. the dog looks up, cocks his
head - and begins wagging his tail. somehow, even though stu's in a
different body, buster recognizes him.
