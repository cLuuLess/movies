ext. dark town gates - night

the still-muttering reaper wheels lulu toward the entrance to dark town.
the boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance.

                           stu
            he's taking her to the land of death, right? so
            all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!
                 (beat)
            stop shaking! i'll protect you.

                           monkeybone
            oh, sure. mr. action hero! why couldn't i be
            arnold schwarzenegger's figment?

the reaper approaches the gates. he presses a remote-control beeper and
the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass
through.

stu realizes they've only got an instant to make their move. he dives
through the gates at top speed. as soon as he's on the other side, he
hears a nasty clang behind him...

monkeybone is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel, woven in and
out among the meshing teeth! stu gives him a good hard yank, and he
slips out like a strand of fettuccine.

they hear rumbling on the tracks outside. a car is arriving!
