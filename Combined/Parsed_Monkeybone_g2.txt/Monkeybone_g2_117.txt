int. muni bus - late afternoon

passengers are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the bell rope
to alert the driver that they want off. as we move toward the back we
see o.d. stu sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side.

he looks rough. he's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with
blood, and he never did find any shoes. also, it's a hot night and he's
starting to get a little ripe. flies are buzzing all around him.
