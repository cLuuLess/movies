ext. zoo grounds - late afternoon

she races out of the tent - grabs a passing zoo guard.

                           julie
            please. where did you take that man...?

the guard points to an animal control van. julie sees o.d. stu peering
out through a small barred panel. their eyes meet...

                           julie
            who are you? why did you say those things?

                           o.d. stu
            oh, doc, it's all a mixup. we were in the land
            of death. he stole my e-ticket. that's how he
            got my body, see? all they had left for me was
            this corpse!

julie digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.

                           o.d. stu
            don't walk away, doc! he's only here to give
            people nightmares!
                 (no response)

            doc! please! don't you remember the dream? they
            were pulling the plug - i called out to you -
            and you heard me. remember?

this stops julie cold. her spine is tingling. she turns slowly, a single
tear rolling down her cheek. and then...

                           julie
            buster?!?

the dog runs right past julie and bounds up to the animal control van,
barking his head off. now julie is starting to believe. she turns -

                           julie
            stu...how?

                           o.d. stu
            i had to come back, julie. i had to give you
            this.

through the bars he hands her the little box containing grandma's
antique ring.

                           o.d. stu
            i meant to give it to you before. the night we
            crashed. i was so happy, julie, i...try to
            remember me like that, okay? not like this.

she slips the ring on her finger - looks up at o.d. stu with tears
welling in her eyes. he makes an odd snorkeling kind of noise.

                           julie
            what's wrong?

                           o.d. stu
            i'm crying too. i just don't have any tears. i'm
            all dried up.

julie turns. the two detectives we saw in the sleep lab have just
arrived at the gate, and alice and clarissa are leading them over.

                           alice
            detective, please let this man out of the van.
