int. dungeon - entrance

a rat guard stands at attention by the door, tooting his kazoo to
announce the arrival of an honored guest.

                           rat guard
            all hail the most glorious! most eminent! most
            esteemed all-powerful god of sleep...his royal
            lassitude -

                           hypnos
            enough, enough, i'm hung over.

as hypnos passes, the dungeon dwellers race up to the wall of bars that
separates the entry area from the dungeon proper.

                           typhoid mary
            hyp! did you bring me the cough medicine?

                           stephen king
            did you remember the night light i asked for?

                           edgar allan poe
            king, you pussy.

                           stephen king
            bite me, poe! i hate waking up in the dark.

                           hypnos
            sorry, steve, maybe next time. and how's our new
            guest settling in - ?

                           stu
            you set me up!!

stu lunges at hypnos - who backs up just out of reach.

                           hypnos
            easy, pal! i was coming to congratulate you. it
            ain't easy snatching one of those e-tickets.
            steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and
            that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?

                           stu
            why'd you do it? what'd i ever do to you?!?

                           hypnos
            it's simple, stu. we need nightmares - lots of
            'em. so whenever we can swing it, we send a guy
            up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker!
            like steve here. poe. rasputin...we've been
            doing this all the way back to atilla and
            genghis khan!

                           stu
            but why me? why'd you pick on me??

                           hypnos
            the monkey, of course. it was his idea.

                           stu
            monkeybone...!?

                           hypnos
            nobody wants to be a sidekick, stu. so one day
            he comes to us - he's got a proposition. we help
            him get your body...in return he gives us all
            the nightmares we want.

                           stu
            you're nuts! i'm a comic strip artist! what's he
            gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??

                           hypnos
            oh, no, no, no. y'see, stu, as it happens, that
            girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical
            basis of bad dreams. and she just whipped up a
            big old batch of nightmare juice!

stu's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan.

                           hypnos
            oh, we're predicting a record box-office. it's
            like i always say...nightmares are your best
            entertainment!

hypnos marches off, chuckling. stu's head sinks into his hands.
