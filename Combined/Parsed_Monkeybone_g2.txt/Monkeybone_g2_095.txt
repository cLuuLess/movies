int. living room - a moment later - night

loud barking outside. julie wanders over toward the window.

                           alice
            listen. let's bring him in for some tests. i
            guarantee you're overreacting.

julie lifts the curtain - and sees stu-bone in his gas mask, bent over
in a weird crab like stance, chasing buster around the yard with the
monkeybone doll.

julie doesn't seem especially surprised - but alice's mouth falls open.

                           julie
            actually, no, i don't think i'm overreacting.
