int. sleep lab - night

he unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. finds the dispensary
area and kneels beside a locked refrigerator. then he shuffles through
the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "fridge."

on the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label
"oneirix" with red danger stickers all over it. stu-bone takes it out,
flashes a sinister grin, and empties its contents into a similar beaker.
then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it.

he's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of simian grunts
and squeaks - which are translated in subtitle:

                           female baboon
            hey, handsome.

he turns and spots a seductive female baboon who's confmed to a cage in
the corner. the conversation continues in monkey talk.

                           female baboon
            yeah, you. come here, good-looking.
                 (beat)
            why don't you let me out of this cage?

                           stu-bone
            hey, i'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot
            water.

                           female baboon
                 (caressing his chin)
            i know how to be very, very grateful.

he pulls out a matchbook and scribbles a number on it.

                           stu-bone
            tell you what, angel. when you get out, give me
            a call...

a light goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! stu-bone tries to dive
for cover, but the female baboon grabs him by the belt and pulls him
against the cage.

startled, he drops the oneirix beaker - which rolls out into the hall!
