int. screening room - that moment

standing o from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up.
herb, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:

                           herb
            thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is,
            comedy channel has just picked us up with an
            order for six new episodes!

herb leads a round of applause. julie nudges stu - the only guy in the
room who's still in his seat.

                           herb
            now, let's give it up for the guy who started it
            all. creator of america's most disturbed comic
            strip...the man behind the monkey...mister stu
            miley!

a spotlight hits him, and he stands to tumultuous applause. he looks
genuinely stunned. he can't believe it's happening.

julie surreptitiously pinches him on the bottom, giving him a start. she
winks at him. he shoots her a small private smile - then turns to wave
at the adoring crowd.
