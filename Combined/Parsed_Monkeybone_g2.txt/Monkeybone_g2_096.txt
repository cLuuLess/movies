ext. back yard - that moment - night

buster is apparently alone now - he's pacing in circles under a high
tree branch, staring up and growling. someone throws a pine cone at the
picket fence. buster's head turns, just for an instant -

                           stu-bone
            kreeegahhhh!!!

- and stu-bone plunges out of the tree, directly on top of the dog! the
two of them grapple, rolling around on the grass.

for a moment it looks like this battle royale could go either way. then
stu-bone gets on top of buster, straddles him, shoves the ass of the
monkeybone doll up against his muzzle...

foont! a purple cloud of nightmare gas hits buster in the face. the dog
goes limp. his eyes roll back in his head. he starts to twitch.

                           stu-bone
            sweet dreams, you little bastard!

disheveled but triumphant, stu-bone stands up, pounds his chest with
both fists, and lets out a tarzanian roar. lights go on all over the
neighborhood. angry neighbors poke their heads out the windows.
