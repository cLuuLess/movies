ext. shrink's building (animated)

a window shatters. the shrink comes hurtling out. monkeybone straddles
him like slim pickens riding an h-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the
way down to the street.

splat! a gob of gore hits stanley in the face as he exits the building.
he kneels on the sidewalk - finding a pipe and a goatee.

                           stanley
            aw, monkeybone! at this rate i'll never find a
            good shrink.

                           monkeybone
            those guys are a waste of money! i'll show you
            how to stop sucking your thumb...

monkeybone sticks his thumb in his butt as he and stanley toddle off
into the sunset.
