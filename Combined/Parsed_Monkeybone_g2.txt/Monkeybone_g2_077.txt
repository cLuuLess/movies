int. dungeon - night

rasputin, atilla, jack the ripper and stephen king are engrossed in
their weekly parcheesi game. stu is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his
fate.

                           stu
            i'm not like the rest of you. i'm just a regular
            guy! i'm not a "nightmare maker."

                           rasputin
            neither are we. we got our bodies hijacked just
            like you. the guys who replaced us are the
            nightmare makers!

                           attila
            like me. i was a mess sergeant in the mongol
            horde. i never wanted to be the scourge of asia.
            i just wanted a new recipe for yak!

                           jack the ripper
            i was jack the haberdasher.

                           stu
            but how? did you all have sidekicks? figments?
            ...monkeys??

                           stephen king
            hey, i got screwed over by my own dog. go
            through hell to get that e-ticket, and who winds
            up in my body? that darn cujo.

typhoid mary runs past, giggling, pursued by a huffing hitchcock.

                           rasputin
            he's sure got a thing for those icy blondes.

kazoos sound. the rat guard appears to announce:

                           rat guard
            miley. you got a visitor.

                           stu
            ...kitty?!?

at the sight of stu behind bars, she breaks down crying.

                           kitty
            i'm so sorry, stu. i wanted to tell you what was
            going on. i really, really liked you.

                           stu
            kitty...my situation is really not important.
            the thing is, my girlfriend is now living with,
            and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.

                           kitty
            you're such a beautiful man. look at you - stuck
            in this place, and only thinking of her.

                           stu
            listen to me! is there any way i can warn her
            what monkeybone is up to??

                           rat guard
            time's up! break it up, you two.

the rat guard pushes stu back with a prod. kitty reaches out...

                           kitty
            no! give me a moment. just to look at him. oh,
            stu. oh, my sweet, sweet stu.

as she gazes at him, love struck, the overhead panel opens and a deluge
of crud from the morpheum lands directly on stu.

                           rat guard
            feeding time!

kitty bawls inconsolably as the rat guard leads her away.

                                                dissolve to:
