int. hospital corridor - a moment later

o.d. stu comes racing around a corridor. his lab coat is already covered
with gore, and he's having trouble holding his guts in. his pancreas
spills out onto the floor just as two doctors stroll past.

                           doctor
                 (eyeing the pancreas)
            might have someone take a look at that.

                        o.d. stu
            oh. yeah. thanks.

the doctors move on. o.d. stu spots a janitor's cart with a roll of duct
tape on one shelf. he wraps it tightly around his midsection to keep his
innards from falling out. then he runs for it.

now the team of surgeons rounds the corner in hot pursuit. the lead
surgeon spots o.d. stu at the end of the corridor and takes off after
him. but he slips on the pancreas and goes sprawling!

the pancreas goes flying down the hall, where it gets squashed in rapid
succession by a gurney and by a little old lady's motorized wheelchair.
when the surgeons retrieve it, it's a hunk of pulp.

                           lead surgeon
            i think it can still be saved. put it on ice.
