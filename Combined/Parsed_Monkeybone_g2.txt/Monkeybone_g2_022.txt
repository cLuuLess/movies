int. stu & julie's house - entry - night

the sound of the key in the lock is met by insane barking. julie and
alice enter and are met by buster, the pet basset - jumping and yipping
like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company.

                           alice
            now don't pick a fight. i'm staying over.

                           julie
            oh, poor buster. he hasn't been fed in a day and
            a half. let me get some food...

alice kneels to play with the dog. she hears a sudden gasp from the
kitchen. julie is standing by the open refrigerator, wearing an
absolutely stricken expression...
