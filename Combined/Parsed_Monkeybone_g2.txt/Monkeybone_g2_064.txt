ext. dark town gates - night

an exhausted stu huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last
stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. he climbs off the
bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have
all been uphill. he slings the yellow pouch over his shoulder...

                           stu
            you saved my life, monkeybone. i never would've
            made it without you.

                           monkeybone
            move it. we got exactly five minutes left.

                           stu
            it's just...now that i'm leaving, i feel like
            there's lots of things i haven't said. who's
            gonna look out for you? are you gonna be okay
            when i'm gone?

                           monkeybone
            oh, don't you worry. i'll be fine.

                           stu
            you've been a hell of a figment, pal. i sure
            wish i could take you home with me.

the gates slide open. stu passes through. but monkeybone lingers behind
a moment - just long enough for one of the singing sphinxes to slip him
a big, nasty baseball bat.

                           monkeybone
            awwww. worried about my feelings, are you? well,
            there's a new twist.

                           stu
            don't joke around, little buddy. i mean it. i
            really do love y--

he turns - and monkeybone mark mcgwires him upside the head! stu
crumples in a heap...

                           monkeybone
            love you too. boss.

laughing maniacally, monkeybone steals the e-ticket and goes racing off
down the midway!!

stu's head is swimming. it takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his
feet. by now, monkeybone is halfway to the e-ticket ride. worse yet,
stu's watch reads 8:59 am!!!

                           stu
            stop! monkeybone! please!!
