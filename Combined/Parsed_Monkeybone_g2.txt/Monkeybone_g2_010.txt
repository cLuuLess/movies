ext. parking lot - night

stu, julie, and herb in the parking lot. a small safari of flunkies is
loading enormous boxes full of monkeybone junk into stu's beat-up car -
stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels,
team jackets and more! stu groans at the sight of it...

                           herb
            they're just prototypes...take 'em home and look
            at 'em before you say no...
                 (scanning the streets)
            if you could just hold on a minute or two, we're
            expecting a couple more trucks.

stu glowers at herb as he opens the car door for julie.

                           herb
            okay, okay! you're a beautiful couple. go.
