int. hyp's hideaway - on stu

julie's distress is killing him. yet all around him, darktowners are
cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the
air like rowdy drunks at a football game. he loses it altogether.

                           stu
            julie! i'm here, doc! don't let them pull the
            plug! i'm here!!!

he won't be stopped this time. he makes for the orb - climbing over
sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks -

                           cyclops
            hey! watch it, you stinkin' gringo -

                           stu
            julie! i'm here! i love you!

somehow, julie has heard him!! down in the nightmare orb, her dream self
is looking up, trying to locate the source of stu's disembodied voice!
he struggles to reach the orb, but the cyclops is holding him back.

                           julie
            stu? stu...?

stu breaks free and flings himself on the orb - which shorts out in a
haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare. julie's image
vanishes - and stu gropes at the air, despairing.
