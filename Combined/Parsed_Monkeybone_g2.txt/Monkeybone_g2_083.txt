ext. street - day

a carload of supermodels. they kill their engine in the middle of a busy
intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing stu-bone.

he cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and flattens himself
behind a dumpster. as the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief
and mops sweat from his brow.

then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and flings his sweaty
hankie into the midst of the groupies. a catfight ensues as they
scramble after this precious memento. the chase resumes.

suddenly he realizes he's slowing down...running in slo-mo. same deal
with the girls on his trail. after a moment, he freezes. he can't move
anything except his eyes; he looks right, left, up, down...

...and suddenly he sees hypnos winking into view directly in front of
him! hypnos is perfectly capable of moving. he strolls right up to the
frozen stu-bone and slaps him repeatedly, moe howard-style.

                           hypnos
            you two-bit simian stooge. what the hell is
            this? we didn't send you up here to shake your
            booty and chase broads. we sent you up to make
            nightmares!!

stu-bone tries to speak. all that comes out is a slo-mo drawl.

                           hypnos
            now find that nightmare juice and get to work.
            'cause you may be a free man during the day...
            but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine!

he winds up - throws a roundhouse punch at stu-bone's face.
