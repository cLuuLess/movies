38   int. elle's dorm room - day                                        38

     a grey, dingy, cell-block style room -- now crammed with
     elle's clothes, the pink fluffy love seat and potted palm,
     along with an elliptical cross-trainer, pink flamingo party
     lights and a neon pink margarita glass sculpture.

     elle tries to shove a large law textbook into her tiny prada
     backpack to no avail. she gives up and tosses the book onto
     the bed where underdog leaps away to miss being squished.


                          elle

               wish me luck, underdog. it's my first
               class as a serious law student.

     she kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate
     skimpy gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy,
     wire-rimmed glasses.

                    (continuing; to herself)
