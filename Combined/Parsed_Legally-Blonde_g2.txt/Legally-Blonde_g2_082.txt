84   int. austen, platt, jaret & donovan - lobby - day                  84

     the elevator door opens and warner and elle emerge. elle is
     sporting her new, boring "lawyer" clothes. warner is baffled
     and impressed by her transformation.


                           warner

                you look -- nice.

                             elle

                thank you.

     she gives him an aloof smile and walks off. warner watches her
     go. sarah stands in the lobby. none too happy to witness this.
