58   ext. off-campus house - back porch - night                         58


     elle walks onto the back porch and finds warner --dressed as
     o.j. in a usc football uniform, number 32, with a ball and
     chain on his foot.


                              elle

                hey, o.j.

     warner turns. he looks around for sarah.      not seeing her, he
     smiles at elle, admiring her costume.


                             warner

                wow.    you're a walking felony.


                              elle

                thank you.     having fun?


                              warner

                     ( c h e c k i n g her out)
                now i am.

                          elle

                    (flirty)
               i feel like we've barely spent any time
               together since we got here.

                          warner

               that's because i spend all my time with
               case studies and hypos.

                          elle

               tell me about it. i can't imagine doing
               all this and donovan's internship next
               year.

                          warner

                    (scoffing)
               elle, c'mon, there's no way you'll get
               the grades to qualify for one of those
               spots . you're not smart enough.
     she can't believe he's saying this.   he realizes he's gone
     too far, and back-pedals.

                         warner (cont'd)

                   (continuing)
               i didn't mean --

                          elle

                    (cutting him off)
               am i on glue, or did i not get into the
               same law school you did, warner?

                           warner

                     (covering)
               we ll , yeah, but --

                          elle

               but what? we took the same lsat, we take
               th e same classes --

                         warner

               i just don't want to see you get your
               hopes up. you know how you get.
     she stares at him.   realizing the awful truth.

                         elle

               i'11 never be good enough for you, will

               i?

     when he doesn't answer, she walks back into the house.




                                                                       50.
