117   int. austen, jaret, platt etc. - elevator - moment later      117    


      elle is in the elevator. flushed and upset. as the doors
      start to close, sarah sticks her arm in, blocking them.

                          sarah

                you almost had me fooled.

                           elle

                what?

                          sarah

                maybe you should sleep with the judge
                too. then we can win the case.
      sarah steps back, letting the doors shut.
