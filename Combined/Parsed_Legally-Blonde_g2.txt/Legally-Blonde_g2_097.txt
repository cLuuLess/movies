                how can you still believe she's innocent?


                           elle

                you're going to trust the word of a woman
                who named her child after a condiment?
                she's ly-ing.

                           emmett

                and you know this for a fact?


                         ' elle

                did you see the icky black color of her
                hair?

                            emmett

                so?

                            elle

                i never trust a woman who's not blonde.
                except for my friend serena, but that's
                only because she's a blonde at heart.
                that's the whole reason i ' m starting the
                blonde legal defense fund.
     he looks at her and laughs.

                            emmett

                the what?


                          elle

                blondes are discriminated against
                worldwide! brooke's a blonde, and people
                are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy
                pool boy and shooting her husband. if
                she was a mousy brunette, it would be,
                "oh, the poor widow."

                          emmett

                you're serious?
     she's fired up now.


                            elle

                you should see the way i ' m treated in
                class! i'm a complete source of mockery.
                this is why the blonde legal defense fund
                is needed.
     he goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm.

                          emmett

                okay, how would it work?

               it would be a full-service law firm, by
               and for blondes, providing positive
               blonde role models and community outreach
               in high blonde areas. i mean, think
               about it -- name one blonde intellectual
               role model.

                          emmett

               -- i can't.

                         elle

               that is a direct result of anti- blonde
               discrimination!

                          emmett

               wait -- hilary clinton.

                         elle

               if she were a true blonde, she would've
               left the cheating bastard. blondes don't
               let their husbands get fellated by
               brunettes and live to tell about it.
     emmett frowns.

                          emm e t t

        .     in that case, maybe heyworth got ---
               fellated --by a brunette and brooke
               caught him.

                         elle

               exactly how much gorilla sex do you think
               a sixty-year-old man can take? ·.

                         emmett

               that's not really a topic that keeps me
               up at night -- but maybe it should.
     elle digs in her purse.

                         elle

               speaking of that ·-- i bought you some
               seaweed cream while we were at the spa.
     she hands it to him.    he keeps his hands on the wheel, not
     taking it.

                         emmett

               what the hell is that for?

                            elle

                 the bags under your eyes. you're an
                 attractive man, but you need to take
                 better care of yourself.

                               emmett

                 i don't --
                      (gesturing to the cream)
                 do that stuff.

                            elle

                 well, you should --. i f you look good,     you            ·    
                 feel good and if you feel good, you                             
                 project joy into the world.                                     


                           emmett                                                

                 projecting joy is not my job.

                            elle

           .         (sighing)
                 fine. sorry i brought it up.

      she puts the cream back in her purse.        they ride in silence
      fo r a moment. then --

                            emmett

                 you really think i ' m attractive?


                           elle

                 for a butt-head? yes.

      she smiles at him.                             .
