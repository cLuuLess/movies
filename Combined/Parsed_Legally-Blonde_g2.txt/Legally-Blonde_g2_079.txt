     a throng of buzzing students is gathered around the bulletin

     everyone reacts. she turns and faces the throng.     they stare
     back at her in shock.                                                   
     dignified, she walks through them as they part for her,                 
     stopping in front of warner and sarah.

     as she goes, surprised chatter overtakes the hallway.
