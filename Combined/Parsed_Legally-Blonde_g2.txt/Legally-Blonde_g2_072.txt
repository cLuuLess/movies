     she pulls a resume out of her briefcase and hands it to him..
     he looks at it.                                            ·

                               professor donovan

     she walks on.     emmett walks up, handing the file to donovan.

                           emmett

                 i brought you the windham notes.                            

                            professor donovan

                      (watching elle go)
                you think she just woke up one morning
                and said, "i think i'll go to law school
                today!"?
     ei timett looks after elle,    bemused.


                             emmett

                aside from that lapse in judgement --
                she's got potential.
