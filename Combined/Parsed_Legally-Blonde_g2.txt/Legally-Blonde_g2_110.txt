                 for his truck and i offered to drive for
                 him since he was still on pain-killers
                 and we spent the whole afternoon
                 together! he was unconscious for part of                   
                 it, but it was really fun!

                 dinner date. now go and share your                           
                 goodness with the world while i stay here
                 and have my hoo-hoo waxed.
