     int. east great falls high - classroom - day

     jim sits, waiting for class to start.  miserable.  some
     students are obviously talking about him in the
     background.  others study and chat.

     next to jim is michelle -- the reject, band dork that
     we've seen earlier.  she's got a flute case on her desk.
     she's blabbering to jim.  the kind of blabbering where
     every other sentence sounds like a question, even though
     it isn't.

                         michelle
               and so, one time?  i was at band camp?
               and we weren't supposed to have pillow
               fights?  but we had a pillow fight!
               and it was so much fun!

     jim couldn't care.

                         michelle (cont'd)
               and one time, we all lost our music?
               and we were supposed to play this
               song?  but we didn't know it.  so we
               just made it up!  and we kept playing
               and playing but the conductor didn't
               know what we were doing and it was so
               funny!

     jim looks wistfully over at nadia's empty desk.

                         michelle (cont'd)
               so you're pissed about something, huh?
               you know what i do when i'm angry?  i
               just play some bach on my flute.  it's
               so relaxing.  i learned to do that at
               band camp.

     jim perks up the slightest bit.

                         jim
               hold on.  you have no idea why i'm
               angry?

                         michelle
               is it because we have a test tomorrow?
               sometimes i get cranky when i know i
               have a big test to study for.

                         jim
               yeah, that's pretty much it.

                         michelle
               i thought so.  because, one time?  i
               was at this --

                         jim
                   (interrupting)
               what was your name again?

                         michelle
               michelle.

                         jim
               okay.  michelle, do you want to be my
               date for the prom?

                         michelle
               really?  you seriously want to go with
               me?

                         jim
                   (so forced)
               yes.  seriously.

                         michelle
               are we going to steve stifler's party
               afterwards?  that would be so cool.

                         jim
               whatever you want.

                         michelle
               cool!  we're gonna have so much fun!
               it's like this one time, at band
               camp...
