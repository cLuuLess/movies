                         kevin
               yeah.

     a beat.

                         vicky
               you sure you're comfortable?

                         kevin

                         vicky
               okay.
                   (a beat)
               did you bring a condom?

                         kevin
               yeah, right here.

     he pulls out a condom.  a beat as they contemplate it.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               so, do you want to be -- i mean, how
               do you want to do it?

                         vicky
               i don't know.  how do you?

                         kevin
               like, normal style.  the...missionary
               position.

                         vicky
               okay.

     a moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but -

                         vicky (cont'd)
               kevin...

                         kevin

                         vicky
               i want to hear you say it.

                         kevin
               okay.

     kevin swallows hard.  and says --

                         kevin (cont'd)
               victoria...i love you.

                         vicky

     they both take a deep breath.
