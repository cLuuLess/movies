     int. stifler's cottage - stifler's brother's bedroom - night

     michelle and jim burst in and slam the door.  a toy
     basketball hoop falls off the back of the door.  they are
     standing in a cluttered, toy-strewn, pit of a kid's room.
     one of those stupid plastic airplanes on a string hangs
     from the ceiling, flying in circles.

                         jim
               this'll do.

                         michelle
               now, i have two rubbers.  wear them
               both, it'll desensitize you.  i don't
               want you coming so damn early.

                         jim
               why, uh, what makes you think that i --

                         michelle
               come on.  i saw you on the net.  why
               do you think i accepted this date?
               you're a sure thing!

     jim heartily agrees.
