     ext. front of school - day

     the front of the school.  kevin drives up in his accord.
     he's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school
     senior.  vicky rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.
     she's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big
     "vanderbilt" return address on it.

                         kevin
               it's a big, thick envelope, vicky.
               you got in.

                         vicky
               you think so?

     she tears it open.  pulls out a course catalog, various
     forms, and a letter which she hands to kevin.

                         kevin
               "dear ms. hughes.  we're sorry, but
               after keeping you on the wait list for
               the past couple months, we've decided
               you are now rejected.  enclosed is a
               100-page, full-color brochure on how
               rejected you are."

                         vicky
               kevin, this is serious!

                         kevin
               you got in.

     vicky screams in excitement, like a girl at a beatles
     concert.  then she laughs, and gives kevin a big kiss and
     hug.

                         vicky
               i love you!

     she hugs kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,
     almost perfunctorily returning the hug.
