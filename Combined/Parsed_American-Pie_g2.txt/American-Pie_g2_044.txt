     int. jim's house - kitchen - day

     jim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his
     shoulder.

                         jim
                   (yells)
               mom?!  i'm home!

     no response.  jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a
     fresh-baked pie on the counter.  next to it is a note:
     "jimmy - apple, your favorite.  i'll be home late.
     enjoy!  love mom."

     jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  then stops...as
     a quizzical look spreads across his face.

     after a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the
     pie.  moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.

     then jim becomes more curious.  we can see the gears in
     his head start to turn.  he looks down at the pie like
     it's... well, not a pie.
