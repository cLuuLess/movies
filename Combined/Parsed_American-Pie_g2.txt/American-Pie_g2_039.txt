     int. east great falls high - little auditorium - moment later

     the vocal jazz group is practicing, singing one of those
     doo-wop, acapella love songs (i.e. "love you like i do").
     singing with the group is none other than oz.  he's not
     doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various
     vocal jazz girls.  smiling at them, giving suave little
     waves.

     kevin, stifler, and jim take seats in the back of the
     auditorium, listening.

                         jim
               this is unexpected.

                         stifler
               what did you cocks do to him?  shit,
               if coach marshall sees this, he'll
               kick oz off the team on principle
               alone.

     the song finishes.  oz bounds up to the other guys.

                         oz
               hey guys, you came to watch me in
               action?

                         jim
               yeah, i think you sounded pretty good.

                         stifler
               i think you need your balls
               reattached.

                         oz
               keep it down, dude.

                         stifler
               what the fuck are you doing here?

                         oz
               this place is an untapped resource.
               check it out, dude, these vocal jazz
               girls are hot.

     angle on some vocal jazz girls

     a few of the girls are gathering their stuff, one of whom
     is heather -- conservative-looking, cute.

                         vocal jazz girl #1
               hey, we've got conan the barbarian
               singing with us.

                         vocal jazz girl #2
               maybe he'll crush some beer cans on
               his forehead.

                         heather
               i think he's got a nice voice.

                         vocal jazz girl #1
                   (ribbing her)
               go talk to him, maybe you can teach
               him how to read.

     heather shakes her head.  back to:

                         stifler
               you dipshit, you're expecting to score
               with some goody-goody choir-girl
               priss?

                         oz
               dude, watch me work.  they go for
               sensitive studs like me.

     oz waves goodbye to a final choir girl.
