     ext. east great falls high - night

     kevin still sits there.  jim, oz, and finch come out of
     the school.  slowly they walk up to kevin.

                         oz
               ...guess what?

                         kevin
               i don't care.

                         jim
               kevin, come on, the bus to stifler's
               is gonna be here soon.

                         kevin
               i'm not going.

     a beat as the guys don't know what to say.  kevin's
     speech is halting, downbeat.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               this isn't how i wanted things to turn
               out.  making the pact wasn't just
               about getting laid.  it was about
               doing one last thing with you guys
               before we graduated.  but now i've
               just wasted my last few weeks here
               trying to do what?  i don't even know.
               all i managed to do was fuck up our
               friendship.

     a beat.  oz shrugs.

                         oz
               i still think you're okay.

                         jim
               so do i, kev.

                         finch
               me too.  for the most part.

                         kevin
               nah.  fuck, you guys are right, i
               don't know what i'm doing.  i mean i'm
               acting like i've got it all together
               tonight.  but i know vicky is gonna
               ask me if i love her.  and i don't
               know what i'm gonna say.  so now it's
               like, maybe i'll just wimp out on the
               whole thing.

                         jim
               come on man.  tonight is the night.
               we're finally going to a post-prom
               party on the lake.  we've been waiting
               to do this for the last four years.
               why else are we still friends with
               stifler?  you gotta go.

     a beat as kevin ponders this.

                         oz
               and by the way, sherman didn't even
               get laid.

                         kevin
               he didn't?

                         finch
               nope.  he pissed himself.

     the guys laugh as kevin is puzzled.  they are suddenly
     illuminated by the glare of headlights.  a charter bus
     pulls in front of the school.

                         jim
               there it is.  i want to grab my bag.
               oh, and my date.

                         oz
               come on, kevin.  vicky's looking for
               you.

     jim holds out a helping hand.  kevin looks at it.  grabs
     it, and jim pulls him up.
