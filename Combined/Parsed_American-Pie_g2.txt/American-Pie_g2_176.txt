     int. east great falls high - gym - night

     the gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner.
     like a combination of mardi gras, new year's eve, and
     somebody's bar mitzvah.  a crappy band plays crappy
     imitation rock music.

     most students mill about, talking, generally bored.  the
     only people who are enjoying themselves are the obviously
     drunk students, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk
     stifler in a corner.  chaperone parents try to calm them
     down, futilely.

     the band breaks into a cheesy ballad.  couples lock
     together and sway back and forth like zombies.

     angle on jim and michelle

     they're dancing at arm's length.  jim is not enthused.

                         michelle
               you know, at band camp?  we have
               dances like this.  only they're way
               funner.  don't you think prom is just
               highly overrated?

                         jim
               highly, highly overrated.

     angle on kevin and vicky

     they dance.  both looking a little nervous.  anxious.

     angle on oz and heather

     dancing much slower than anyone else.  tight embrace.
     heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed.

     angle on stifler

     dancing with the girl holding out for finch.
