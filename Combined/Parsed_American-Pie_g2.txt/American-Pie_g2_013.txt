     ext. stifler's house - front door - night

     a group of band dorks is on the porch, including
     michelle.  stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them
     in disbelief.

                         michelle
               we're here for the party?

                         stifler
               what party?  there's no party.

     music blares from inside.  a drunken hand reaches through
     the door and ruffles stifler's hair.

                         party guy (o.s.)
               stiff-lerrr!  par-tyyy!!

     the hand disappears back into the house.  a beat.

                         stifler
               try the house down the street.

     stifler slams the door.  the dorks wait a moment.

                         band dork
               ring the bell again.

                         michelle
               ringing the bell is dorky -- let's
               just go in.

     we hear a click of a deadbolt.
