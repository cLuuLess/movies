     ext. stifler's house - back porch, by the keg - night

     jessica and vicky are refilling their beers at the keg.
     nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup.

                         vicky
               he likes it.

                         jessica
               of course he does.  what about you?
               have you just never had one with kevin
               -- or have you never had one, period?

                         vicky
               i think i've had one.

                         jessica
               well that's a no.  no wonder you're
               not psyched about sex.
                   (starts filling vicky's beer)
               you've never even had one manually?

                         vicky
               ...i've never tried it.

                         jessica
               are you kidding?  you've never double-
               clicked your mouse?

     vicky shrugs.

                         jessica (cont'd)
               hell, just a pair of tight pants will
               set me off.
                   (noticing nadia next to them,
                    she passes the tap along)
               am i right or what, nadia?

                         nadia
                   (no bones about it)
               you are right.  the hands are not
               always necessary.

                         jessica
                   (to vicky)
               see?

                         nadia
               in fact -- i should teach you my own
               special method.  i developed it myself
               at the ballet institute in prague.
               you use nothing but the muscles of the
               inner thigh.

     nadia walks off.

                         jessica
               no wonder she never pays attention in
               class.

     vicky nods, traumatized.
