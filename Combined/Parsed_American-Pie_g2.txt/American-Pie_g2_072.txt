               do you mind?  this fabric is so
               uncomfortable.

     she sets her duffel on jim's bed.

                         jim
               no, go right ahead and get dressed.
               i'll just be downstairs, studying up.
               get me when you're ready.

     jim exits, closing the door behind him.
