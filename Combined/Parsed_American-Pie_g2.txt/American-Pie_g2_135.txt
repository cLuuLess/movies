     int. east great falls high - mural staircase - day

     a girl holding out for finch talks to stifler.

                         girl holding out for finch
               i'm sorry, i really can't go with
               you...i'm holding out for someone
               else.

                         stifler
               you gotta be fucking kidding.

                         girl holding out for finch
               i know it's a long shot, but i figure
               paul finch might ask me.

                         stifler
               finch?  shitbreak?!!

                         girl holding out for finch
               oh gosh, i forgot -- you uh, you look
               okay...i mean you can't even tell...

     flustered, she heads down the stairs.  stifler, entirely
     confused, heads off into the second floor.  as the girl
     holding out for finch descends, kevin catches up with
     her.

                         kevin
               hey...what was that all about?

                         girl holding out for finch
               he's still embarrassed because finch
               kicked his ass.  knocked out a tooth,
               but you can't see it.

                         kevin
               right, and who told you that?
