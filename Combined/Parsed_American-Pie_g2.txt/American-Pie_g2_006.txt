     int. east great falls high - senior lockers - day

     the guys pass by a group of band dorks, most notable of
     which is michelle, who proudly polishes her flute.

                         michelle
               and what we should do today, in band?
               instead of playing our instruments
               regularly?  we should play them
               backwards!  that'll be so funny!

     the band dorks laugh and agree, "hilariously" attempting
     to play their instruments from the wrong end.  the guys
     shudder.

                         jim
               no -- kevin, you?

                         kevin
                   (offended)
               please.
                   (then)
               we're all golden, we're college bound.
               i figured it out -- i can get a c-
               minus in every class, and it's not
               gonna make a difference.  u of m, here
               i come.
