     ext. beach - night

     oz and heather are walking down the beach.  holding
     hands.  deep in the background, we see kids partying.

                         oz
               there's something i've been meaning to
               tell you, heather.

                         heather
               what's that?

                         oz
               it's gonna sound really bad, but i
               want you to know.

     she nods.  they stop walking.  oz swipes his feet around
     in the sand.

                         oz (cont'd)
               see, uh, i'm a virgin.  and me, kevin,
               jim, and finch, we all made this pact.
               that we would...lose our virginity...
               before high school was over.

     heather is listening.

                         oz (cont'd)
               and, see, tonight is supposed to be
               the night we all do it.

                         heather
               this isn't the best way to proposition
               me.

                         oz
               no, that's not what i mean.  i mean --
               look.  you know what made me leave
               that game?  coach was giving this
               speech, about not slacking off when
               you see the opportunity to score.

                         heather
               this isn't any better, chris.

                         oz
               no, see heather, what i realized is
               that...with you, it's not like i'm
               running towards the goal, trying to
               figure out the best way to score.  and
               this may sound corny, but --

     he takes her hand.

                         oz (cont'd)
               i feel like i've already won.

     heather softens, taken off guard.

                         oz (cont'd)
               and, well, i really care about you.  a
               lot.  and i want you to know that.

                         heather
               oz, it's okay, i know.

                         oz
               you called me oz.

                         heather
               well, that's what your friends call
               you.  i mean...i feel like i'm one of
               your friends now...and also...your
               girlfriend.

     oz seems truly touched.

                         oz
               dieter.  my middle name is dieter.

     heather nods, and speaks pensively.

                         heather
               hmm.  you know that's
                   (cracking up)
               really a shitty middle name!

                         oz
                   (laughing)
               i know, it sucks!

     through their laughter, they kiss.  after a moment, it
     grows more passionate.  lost in each other.
