     int. east great falls high - main hallway - day

     kevin and oz catch up to jim.  here and there, people
     still give jim funny looks.

                         kevin
               hey, minuteman.

                         jim
               shut up.  you're supposed to be
               supportive.

                         oz
               you've still got a chance with nadia,
               right?

                         jim
               no.  her sponsors here saw the thing
               on the net.  i don't think they liked
               it.

                         kevin
               how do you know that?

                         jim
               she's already on a plane back home.

     kevin winces.

                         jim (cont'd)
               you know, maybe i'm just not good with
               girls, period.  like i was born
               without that part of the brain.  i
               mean, i can't talk to girls.  and when
               i do talk to them, i screw it up.

                         kevin
               yeah?  well come prom night, those
               excuses aren't going to do you much
               good.

                         jim
               jesus, kevin, rub it in.

     a nearby old janitor starts guffawing at jim as he walks
     by.
