     int. east great falls high - bathroom stall - day

     finch has stopped.  he's staring down at the toilet.  it
     looks entirely uninviting.  but he's straining,
     struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he
     cramps up.

     he grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with
     it.  then another, and another.  sweat drips off his
     forehead.

                         finch
               come on come on come on...

     he's got the seat lined with at least three layers of
     toilet paper.  notices a spot where there's still bare
     toilet seat.  he tears off one square of toilet paper,
     placing it on the spot.  he steps back and looks it over,
     still wriggling to contain his bowels.

                         finch (cont'd)
               okay.  you can do this.

     he unbuckles his pants.  sits down -- just as we hear
     someone enter the bathroom.  finch, still restraining,
     listens for a moment...only to hear the click-click-click
     of heels.
