     ext. east great falls high - entrance to senior lockers - day

     kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.  stifler
     comes running up with a wicked grin on his face.

                         stifler
               kevin!  you seen shitbreak lately?

                         kevin
                   (immediately sensing danger)
               oh no, stifler, what did you do?

                         stifler
               me?  nothing.  i'm the one whose ass
               he kicked.
                   (off kevin's look)
               i'll tell you one thing, though.  i
               don't think he's gonna have a problem
               shitting in school anymore.

     stifler pulls out an empty bottle of prescription
     laxative, maniacally laughing.
