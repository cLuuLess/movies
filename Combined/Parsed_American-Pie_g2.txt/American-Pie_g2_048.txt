     int. kevin's bedroom - night

     late.  kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the
     bible.

     if all students studied the way kevin's studying this
     book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  he's scrutinizing
     it.  turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to
     decipher cave paintings.
