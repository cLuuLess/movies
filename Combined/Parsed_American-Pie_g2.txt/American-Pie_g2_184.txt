     int. stifler's cottage - basement - night

     the party rages in the rest of the cottage, but the
     basement is empty.  stifler's mom sits in the corner,
     smoking a cigarette.  she's as attractive as her photo we
     once saw, but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile
     with a bitter smirk.

     finch stumbles in.

                         finch
               ah, stifler's mom!  thank you for
               letting us have a great party.

                         stifler's mom
                   (dry)
               as if there were any alternative
               in the matter.  are you enjoying
               yourself?

                         finch
               i'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

                         stifler's mom
                   (deadpan)
               i'm so happy for you.  takes the edge
               off, doesn't it?  and where might your
               date be?

                         finch
               oh no, no date.  bathroom incident.

                         stifler's mom
               pardon me?

     finch pauses a moment.  he's got an idea.

                         finch
               ...nevermind.  you have anything to
               drink?

                         stifler's mom
               i believe the kegs are upstairs.

                         finch
               no, no, that's what the cretins drink.
               i mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.

     she considers him as she drags off her cigarette.

                         stifler's mom
               all right, i got some scotch.

                         finch
               single malt?

                         stifler's mom
               aged eighteen years.
                   (she gives him a look)
               why don't you get the glasses.  behind
               the bar.
