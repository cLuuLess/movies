     int. jim's bedroom - day

                         jim
               no, not again.

                         nadia
                   (sighs)
               i am sorry, jim.  i suppose we will
               not be doing any studying now.

                         jim
               no!  i've got...reserve reserves!

     nadia starts getting dressed.  jim is whimpering.

                         nadia
               it is too bad.  i was at first hoping
               you would ask me to the prom.  but...

     she gathers her things.  eyes jim over.

                         nadia (cont'd)
               you should change your shorts.

                         jim
               ...okay.

     jim is stunned.  ruined.  nadia exits.  close on jim's
     tormented face as we hear...

                         computer voice
               "you have lost your internet
               connection.  click 'okay' to
               reconnect."
