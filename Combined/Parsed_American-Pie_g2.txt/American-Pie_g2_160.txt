     int. backstage (msu) - day

     heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind
     the curtain.

     they all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  heather
     looks worried, lost.  looking to the door, as if oz might
     come running in.

                         vocal jazz teacher
               okay.  albert, you ready?

     albert steps next to heather.  he's kind of funny-
     looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as
     plain weird.

                         albert
               no problemo.

     he sings a couple lines.  way too melodramatic and
     cheesy.  heather looks trapped.
