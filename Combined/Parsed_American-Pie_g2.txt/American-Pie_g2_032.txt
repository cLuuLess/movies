     int. jim's bedroom - day

     jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera
     attached to his computer.  the computer screen reads, "e-
     date:  we make love happen."  as jim fiddles with the
     camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image.
     he clicks an onscreen-button labeled "freeze image" --
     the image freezes, showing jim with an awkward grimace.
     the screen reads, "image sent."
