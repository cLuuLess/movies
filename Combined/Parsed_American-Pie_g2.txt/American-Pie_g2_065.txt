     ext. rast great falls - side of school - day

     after school.  oz is there as heather pulls up in a new
     saab.

                         oz
               nice car.

                         heather
               i'm glad you think so.

                         oz
               you don't like it?

                         heather
               no, i like the car.
                   (then, direct)
               by the way, though, about prom?  that
               was like a bad idea.  sorry i invited
               you.

     she hastily walks towards the school.

                         oz
               what?!

                         heather
               oh, please.  i asked you because i
               thought you might actually be worth
               going with.  but you are just a jock.
               no wait.  you're a jerk.

                         oz
               what?  no i'm not.

                         heather
               i saw you making fun of me with your
               lacrosse buddies.

                         oz
               i wasn't making fun of you.

                         heather
               give me a break, you're so full of it.

     she hurries up more, breaking off from oz, and enters the
     school.  after a moment, he slowly heads in.
