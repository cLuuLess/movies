     int. stifler's cottage - stifler's brother's bedroom - night

     jim and michelle going at it.  again, we hear but can't
     see them.  the room is more trashed than before.  and as
     we pan across the disaster area they've created --

                         jim (o.s.)
               are you gonna do what i think you're
               gonna do?

                         michelle (o.s.)
               don't you want me to?

                         jim (o.s.)
               oh yeah!  put it in your mouth!

                         michelle (o.s.)
               okay!

     we see her...on top of jim.  she clears her throat.  and
     then we see her raise a children's plastic recorder to
     her lips -- and she whistles the michigan fight song.  on
     cue, jim chimes in --

                         jim
               hail, hail, to michigan, the leaders
               and best!
