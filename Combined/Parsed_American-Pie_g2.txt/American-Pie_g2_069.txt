     int. kevin's bedroom - day

     kevin and finch sit in front of a computer.  kevin is
     unloading beer and chips from a grocery bag.

     we see an image of jim's bedroom on the computer screen.
     it's a little strobed, but easily watchable.  suddenly
     jim's face pops into frame.  he's adjusting the camera.

                         kevin
               there we go.
