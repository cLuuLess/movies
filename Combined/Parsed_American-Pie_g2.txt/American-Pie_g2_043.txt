     int. east great falls high - back of library - day

     kevin is walking through the "religion" section.  he
     carefully looks about, making sure nobody's watching.

                         kevin's brother (v.o.)
               it originally started as a sex manual,
               this book that some guys brought back
               from amsterdam in the early eighties.
               what to do with your tongue, things
               like that.  and each year, it got
               passed on to one east student who was
               worthy of it.

     kevin kneels down on the floor, near a section of various
     bibles on the bottom shelf.

                         kevin's brother (v.o.)(cont'd)
               after a couple years, guys started
               adding their own techniques.  things
               they figured out themselves.

     kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom
     shelf.  pulls out a pocket knife.  flips up the bottom of
     the shelf.  slides it out.

                         kevin's brother (v.o.)(cont'd)
               you have to keep it a secret, and
               return it at the end of the year.  so,
               now you know.  good luck.

     there, a bit dusty, is an old book.  many extra pages of
     notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking
     the binding.  the original title is now obscured -- over
     it, someone has written "the bible."

     remember when indian jones found that gold statue?  it's
     like that right now.

     kevin carefully pulls it out.  reverently flips through
     it.  full of details.  explicit diagrams.  anecdotes.
     and atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the
     date it was added.

     kevin reaches the last page.  it's blank.  he lightly
     runs his hand down the empty page.
