     int. sushi bar - day

     kevin's brother is on his cell phone.  a sushi chef
     prepares food behind the counter.

                         kevin's brother
               orgasm?

     the sushi chef looks up.  kevin's brother turns away.

                         kevin
               yeah.

                         sushi customer
                   (to kevin's brother)
               what's good here?

                         kevin's brother
               try the spicy tuna hand roll.

                         kevin
               what?!  how do i do that?

                         kevin's brother
               uh -- forget that.  look, is that all
               you're interested in?  ways to get
               your girlfriend into bed?

                         kevin
               well, no.  i think...i guess it would
               be good to be able to return the
               favor.  i mean, it would be nice to
               know she enjoys things as much as i
               do.

                         kevin's brother
               that's good, that's what i needed to
               hear.  now you qualify.

                         kevin
               qualify for what?

                         kevin's brother
               you've just inherited the bible.
