     int. stifler's house - kitchen - night - same time

     oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to jim,
     stifler, and some guys.

                         stifler
                   (hysterical, toppling over)
               you actually said that?!  haaaah!!

                         oz
               shut the fuck up.

                         jim
               hey, you did better than i did, nova.

                         oz
               oh that's really reassuring.  and
               don't call me nova anymore.  i'm a
               fraud.

                         stifler
               this is pathetic.  i'm gonna find me a
               little hottie.

     stifler strides into another room.

                         stifler (o.s.)(cont'd)
                   (yelling)
               suck me, beautiful!

     oz wallows in his beer can, beaten.
