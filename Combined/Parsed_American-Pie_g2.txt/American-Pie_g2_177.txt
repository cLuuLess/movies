     int. east great falls high - a corner of the gym - night

     kevin, oz, jim, and finch are hanging out.  finch is
     drunk.

                         finch
               okay.  i'm here for your dumb...dumb
               meeting.

     sherman passes by.

                         sherman
               i'm on the offensive, boys.  the
               sherman tank is going back in.

     the guys are impassive.  sherman indicates the central
     girl nearby.

                         sherman (cont'd)
               locked on target, flying in stealth
               mode under enemy sex radar.  ready to
               drop the payload...again.

     sherman confidently walks off.

                         kevin
               alright, how do you guys stand?  well,
               finch, i know where you are, but you
               can't use that as an excuse.  jim?

                         jim
               my date's a flute-toting band dork.
               that answer your question?

                         kevin
               oz, how about you and heather?  now
               you guys are a couple or something?

                         oz
                   (getting ticked)
               dammit, kevin, what's with the
               attitude?

                         kevin
               attitude?  me?  i think that you guys
               should be more enthusiastic.  shit,
               we've been trying to get laid forever,
               and tonight's the night we've been
               waiting for.  we're in this together.
               don't back out on me now!

                         jim
               back out?  you don't need us to get
               laid.  you afraid or something?

                         kevin
               no, but come on guys, we made a pact!

                         oz
               kevin, it was just a --

                         kevin
               it was a pact.  you break it and there
               are no excuses.  you guys have to --

                         jim
                   (interrupting, pissed)
               i don't have to do shit!  forget it
               already!

     kevin is taken aback.

                         jim (cont'd)
               i'm tired of all this bullshit
               pressure!  i mean, i've never even had
               sex and already i can't stand it!  i
               hate sex!  i don't want it, i've never
               wanted it, and i'm not gonna sit here
               busting my balls over something that
               just isn't that damn important!  so
               fuck this stupid pact, fuck you, and
               fuck sex!  now, i'm gonna go hang out
               with that geek over there, 'cause at
               least she's got something else to talk
               about besides sex!  god damn!

     kevin storms off.  a beat.

                         finch
               at least i learned how to shit in
               school.

     jessica approaches.  she's dressed well, but not
     lavishly.

                         jessica
               hey, finch.  wanna dance?

     finch looks to the guys.  they shrug.  we follow with
     jessica and finch as they dance out onto the floor.

                         finch
               how come you have no date?

                         jessica
               i like to keep my options open.  and
               let me just clarify that you have no
               chance of scoring with me, finch.

                         finch
               no, of course not, don't be
               ridiculous.

     angle on vicky and central girl

                         vicky
               so, i guess you and sherman are pretty
               close.  you met at that party a while
               back?

                         central girl
               yeah, we were up the whole night
               together.  we had one of those
               amazingly deep conversations, where
               you really feel like you get to know
               someone.

                         vicky
                   (nudge, nudge)
               "deep conversation," huh?  is that
               what you guys call it?

                         central girl
               what else would i call it?
