     int. east great falls high - hallway - a little later

     heather is walking down the hall.  she turns to go into
     the little auditorium -- and through the window in the
     door she sees oz.  she stops.

     oz is singing, working through the solo.  determined to
     get it right.  he bounces his lacrosse ball off the
     floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  there's one point that
     he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  heather
     watches this, softening as she sees that oz is actually
     putting his heart into it.  finally he's frustrated --

                         oz
               dammit!

     he whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  heather recoils,
     still watching, unseen by oz.  after a moment, oz cools
     off.  he gets the ball, and diligently starts up again.
     heather is impressed.
