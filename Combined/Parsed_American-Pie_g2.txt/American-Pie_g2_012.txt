     int. stifler's house - night

     for a high-school party, it's pretty good.  the house is
     peppered with all types of high-school students.  music
     blends with the din of excited conversation.

     kevin and jim are drinking beers.  around them, students
     mingle and flirt.  chuck sherman comes up.

                         sherman
               what's up, fellas?

                         jim
               hey sherman.  scopin' the babes.

                         sherman
               indeed.  some fine ladies here, boys.
               confidence is high, repeat, confidence
               is high.
               sherman is moving to defcon two, full
               strategic arsenal ready for
               deployment.

                         jim
               you've got something going?

                         sherman
               did you see that central chick?
               brunette?

                         kevin/jim
               no.

                         sherman
               she's around.  seems that she's taken
               a liking to me.  fellas, it's time
               that she experienced -- the
               sherminator.

                         kevin
               yeah, okay sherman, whatever.

                         sherman
               i'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent
               back through time...to change the
               future for one lucky lady.

                         kevin
               yeah man, right on!

     sherman saunters off into the party.

                         kevin (cont'd)
                   (shakes his head)
               hopeless.

     vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys,
     exchanging greetings.  jim spots nadia across the room.
     she's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman.

                         jim
               oh, shit!  there she is.  nadia.

                         vicky
               you like her?  her sponsor family
               lives on my block.  why don't you talk
               to her?

                         jim
               what would i say?

                         vicky
               just tell her what's on your mind.
               and smile, you've got a good smile.
                   (then to kevin)
               come on.

                         kevin
                   (to jim)
               gotta go.

                         jim
               but --

     kevin and vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as jim
     sees nadia approaching him.  he freaks.

                         jim (cont'd)
               kevin, get back here!

     but he's gone.  and nadia is now in front of him.  with
     no other alternative, jim readies himself, smiling big.

                         nadia
                   (with a really sexy accent)
               you are in my english class, no?

     jim smiles.

                         jim
                   (barely)
               yes.

                         nadia
               i thought so.

     jim's smile grows even bigger, almost stupid.  a beat.

                         nadia (cont'd)
               so you are having fun?

     jim nods, still smiling away.  staring right through her
     head.

                         nadia (cont'd)
               i said, you are having fun?

     a little squeak escapes his throat.  jim is on mental
     vacation.

                         nadia (cont'd)
               me too.

     a beat.  jim's expression is now plasticized.  eyes
     vacant.  a frozen, completely artificial smile. nadia is
     confused.

                         nadia (cont'd)
               well...i am going to get another beer.
               you want one?

     jim strains to speak, through his smile.

                         jim
               no...you...go...ahead.

                         nadia
               okay.

     she walks off.  jim sighs, completely relaxing, like a
     huge burden is now off of him.  he wipes his brow.  then,
     realizing --

                         jim
               oh, shit.  no!  shit!

     he pounds his head with his fist.
