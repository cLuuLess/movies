     int. dog days - day

     the guys are finishing up breakfast.  hot dogs & eggs.

                         kevin
               now, the sex -- it's got to be valid,
               consensual sex.  no funny stuff.  and
               no prostitutes, if you were thinking
               about that, finch.

     finch gives a wistful "who, me?"

                         kevin (cont'd)
               so, i'm thinking prom is basically our
               last big chance.

                         oz
               dude, prom sucks.

                         kevin
               i know, but think about it -- at the
               parties that night.  chicks are gonna
               want to do it.

                         jim
               yeah, it's like tradition or
               something.

                         kevin
               right.  that gives us...

                         jim
               exactly three weeks to the day.

     they take this in with some trepidation.

                         kevin
               alright then.  it's official.  any
               questions?

     there are none.  kevin raises his pepsi.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               to the next step.

     the guys raise their drinks.

                         all
               to the next step.

     they toast.  and from this, we go into our strategizing
     for sex montage:
