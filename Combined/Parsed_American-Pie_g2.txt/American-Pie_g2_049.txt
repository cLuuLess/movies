     int. east great falls high - little auditorium - day

     the vocal jazz group is doing a song.  oz is singing
     along, really making it look like he's into it.  he
     closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  as
     the song ends, oz continues just a moment more with his
     shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the
     number.  the thing is, it actually sounds really good.

     oz opens his eyes...to see the whole group -- especially
     the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed.

     the choir teacher is a smartly-dressed black woman.

                         choir teacher
               what the hell was that?

                         oz
               sorry.

                         choir teacher
               no, it was good.

                         oz
               oh, well...
                   (noticing heather looking at
                    him, he acts "sensitive")
               it came from the heart.

                         choir teacher
               well then keep it coming.
                   (to everyone)
               alright, people, good work!  keep it
               up and we'll do great at the state
               competition.

     rehearsal wraps up, and heather comes up to oz.

                         heather
               not bad, chris.

                         oz
                   (surprised himself)
               really?  hey, thanks -- heather,
               right?

                         heather
               yeah...so...you've got this sort of...
               bobby mcferrin thing going there.

                         oz
                   (no idea)
               yeah.  right, uh-huh.
                   (then, back into it)
               i feel like i've discovered this whole
               new side of me.  music is so
               expressive.

                         heather
                   (amused)
               okay.
                   (then)
               i mean, i agree, but...aren't you
               supposed to be out, like, trying to
               decapitate someone with your lacrosse
               stick or something?

     oz "gets serious" at this.

                         oz
               oh sure.  i know what people think.
               it's like, oz, he's just this kickass
               lacrosse player -- i also play
               football, by the way -- but that's
               like...not all that i am.

                         heather
               of course, i didn't --

                         oz
                   (cutting her off)
               i mean it really bothers me when
               people try to pigeonhole me like that.

                         heather
                   (sparking to this)
               you?  you think i don't get that?
               god, it's like just because i don't
               get drunk and barf every weekend,
               people say "oh, here's this goody-two-
               shoes choir-girl priss."

     of course, this is what stifler said about her.  and for
     a moment, this catches oz off guard.

                         oz
               yeah...so like, what else do you do?

                         heather
                   (offended)
               well the same things you do.  hang out
               with friends and stuff, you know,
               whatever.
                   (then)
               what do you think i do?

                         oz
                   (genuine)
               i just -- realized that i didn't know
               anything about you.  i was interested.

                         heather
               oh...well that's okay.  cool.
