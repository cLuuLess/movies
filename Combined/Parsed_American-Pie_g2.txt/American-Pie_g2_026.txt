     int. stifler's house - day

     the next morning.  the party is long over.  plastic beer
     cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not
     trashed.

     jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  he
     stumbles over a body.  it's kevin.

                         kevin
               ow, what the hell?

                         jim
               sorry, i thought you were dead.

     they walk over to the other side of the room.  finch is
     sitting on the couch.

                         finch
               good morning gentleman.

                         jim
               finch!  where were you last night?
               what happened to the foolproof plan?

                         finch
               i thought a fashionably late entrance
               would enhance my appearance.
                   (off their looks)
               when i got here, the bacchanalia was
               over and the nymphs had left.

     oz wanders in, still sullen.  takes a seat, sulking.

                         kevin
               feeling better, oz?

                         oz
               i'm such a loser.

                         kevin
               that's the spirit.

     we hear footsteps coming down the stairs.  it's the
     central girl.  she wears a "central" sweatshirt.  sherman
     follows behind her.  the guys watch in disbelief as
     sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.

                         sherman
                   (snippets of conversation)
               ...i'll never forget...thank you.

     the central girl smiles.  notices the other guys
     watching.  just gives sherman a kiss on the cheek.

                         central girl
               bye.

     she exits.  the guys are dumbfounded.  jaws hang.
     sherman looks triumphant.  strides over to the guys.

                         jim
               you did it.

                         sherman
               fellas, say goodbye to chuck sherman,
               the boy.  i am now a man.

     the guys are shocked and amazed.

                         sherman (cont'd)
               i highly recommend you join the club.

                         kevin
               i -- i don't get it, how the hell did
               you do that?

                         sherman
               it was just my time, fellas, it was
               just my time.  best of luck to you,
               boys.

     sherman exits.  silence.  the guys look like they just
     lost the world series on errors.  they slowly take seats,
     ruined.

                         kevin
               i put in months of quality time with
               vicky.  sherman meets a chick for one
               night and scores?  this is just wrong.

                         oz
               no shit, i'm never gonna get laid.
               how the hell am i gonna become this
               mr. sensitive man?

                         jim
               jesus, we're all gonna go to college
               as virgins.  they've probably got
               special dorms for people like us.

     a long beat as they give this serious consideration.
     then, kevin strides purposefully to the front of the
     group.

                         kevin
               alright, i got an idea.  but it stays
               between us.  agreed?

     they do.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               okay.  it's really simple.  we
               make an agreement -- no wait, more
               than an agreement.

                         jim
               like a bet?

                         kevin
               no, a pact.  no money involved.  this
               is more important than any bet.  now
               here's the deal: we all get laid
               before we graduate.

     a beat

                         oz
               dude, it's not like i haven't been
               trying to get laid.

                         kevin
               this is different.  this is better.
               think of when you're working out, oz.
               you need a partner, someone to spot
               you.  someone to keep you motivated.

     oz nods, getting into it.  kevin smiles and continues,
     arms outspread.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               that's what we are, we keep each other
               on track.  prior to this day, we've
               postured.  we've procrastinated.
               we've pretended.  we've -- well i
               can't think of other p-words, but
               we've probably done them too.

                         jim
               pontificated.

                         kevin
                   (ignoring him)
               separately, we are flawed and
               vulnerable.  but together, we are the
               masters of our sexual destiny!

                         jim
                   (kung fu voice)
               their tiger-style kung-fu is strong;
               but our dragon style will defeat it!

                         oz
                   (going on)
               the sha-lin masters from east and west
               must unite!

                         kevin
               guys, guys -- you're ruining my
               fucking moment here.  now think about
               it --

     kevin jumps up on a chair.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               no longer will our penises remain
               flaccid and unused!  from now on, we
               fight for every man out there who
               isn't getting laid when he should be!
               this is our day!  this is our time!
               and, by god, we're not gonna let
               history condemn us to celibacy!  we
               will make a stand!  we will succeed!
               we will get laid!

     kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in
     front of him.  one by one, the guys pile their hands on
     top, in between them -- it's a pact!  they break with a
     cheer.  woo-hoo!

                         stifler
                   (wandering down from upstairs)
               what the hell are you losers doing?

     they all stop.  stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his
     mouth.  a goatee of dried toothpaste.

                         finch
               if i might ask, when you brush your
               teeth, do you spit or swallow?

     stifler tries to give a retort to finch, but turns green
     and heads back upstairs.
