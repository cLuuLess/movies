     int. jim's bedroom - day

     we see the same image on jim's screen.  jim turns off
     just the monitor.  it looks like the computer is off --
     the ruse is undetectable.

     jim's dad enters with nadia.  she's in sweats and a
     leotard, carrying a duffel bag over her shoulder.  jim's
     dad is delighted, fidgety, almost giddy.

                         jim's dad
               son.  this lady's here for you.

                         jim
                   (like it's no big deal)
               i know.  hey nadia.

                         nadia
               hello james.  ready to study.

                         jim's dad
               oh, you bet he is.  jim's quite the
               bookworm.

                         jim
               dad.

                         jim's dad
               oh, no, not too much of a bookworm.
               he's a good little kid.  er, guy.
               man.

                         jim
               dad!!

                         jim's dad
               okay, okay.  i'll let you hit those
               books.

     jim's dad gives a knowing look and exits.
