     int. stifler's cottage - party room - night

     it's a great party.  stifler is with a group of guys
     drinking a beer, which he inspects very carefully before
     every sip.

     angle on jim and michelle

     both drinking and talking, almost enjoying themselves.

                         michelle
               that is a nasty story!

                         jim
               i told you.

                         michelle
               you wanna hear a nasty story of mine?
               it's kind of sexual.

     ding!  a light goes off in jim's head.

                         jim
               yeah, bring it on!

                         michelle
               well, this one time?  at band camp?
               we were playing this game, i don't
               know if you know it?  but it's called
               spin the bottle?  and i had to kiss
               this guy named marc wander on the
               lips?  and...

     jim's expression sinks.
