     kevin is on the phone.  hanging near his closet is a
     tuxedo.  intercut with kevin's older brother -- 25, on
     his cell phone, traveling down a california road.

                         kevin's brother
               you called me to ask me how to get laid?

                         kevin
               what was i gonna do, call dad?  i
               don't even know his number.

                         kevin's brother
               just dial 976-asshole.

                         kevin
               yeah, well anyway...i thought you
               might have some advice, brother to
               brother.  i mean, i think tonight she
               might, we might really, there's a
               chance that -- you know.

                         kevin's brother
               have you ever heard of the bible?

                         kevin
               what?  not the bible?

                         kevin's brother
               well, that's not really the name, but
               we always called it that.

                         kevin
               does it tell me how to get laid?

                         kevin's brother
               you know what, nevermind.  you're not
               ready.

                         kevin
               ready for what?

                         kevin's brother
               whoop, you're fading out.  good luck
               at that party.
