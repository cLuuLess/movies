     int. music hall stage - day

     the vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing
     "how sweet it is."  oz sings with them now in his vocal
     jazz outfit...we tilt down to see he's still wearing his
     cleats.  he and heather sound great, backed by the vocal
     jazz group.  they sail through their duet, join hands,
     and finish perfectly.  the audience applauds with
     enthusiasm -- and we kevin and jim, whooping and
     clapping, loving it, like they're at a rock concert.

                         jim
               yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!

                         kevin
                   (gives that "you rock!" hand
                    sign)
               you fuckin' rule!
