     ext. lacrosse field (msu) - day

     oz shows some emotion peeking through.  confused.

                         coach marshall
               it all boils down to today.  for you
               seniors, this marks the culmination of
               your past four years.  think of what
               that means to you.  are you guys gonna
               look back on your days at east and
               know that you made the most of the
               time you had?

     a wave of realization washes over oz.  he stands up tall.

                         coach marshall (cont'd)
               now that's the attitude, ostreicher!

     oz collects himself.  takes a deep breath.

                         oz
               good luck, guys.

     he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave.

                         coach marshall
               christ!  i didn't say you were out of
               the game!

                         oz
               sorry, coach.

                         coach marshall
               what the fuck is this?  you got
               someplace more important to be?

     coach marshall is fuming.  the entire team is staring at
     oz.

                         oz
               yeah.

     he runs off.

     angle on jim and kevin in the stands

     a beat of confusion.  then they stand up.
