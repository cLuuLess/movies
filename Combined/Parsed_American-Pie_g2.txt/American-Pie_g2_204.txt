     int. stifler's cottage - bedroom - day

     kevin and vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at
     the ceiling.  though they're trying to conceal it, we can
     see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking
     through.

                         kevin
               that was a great night.

                         vicky
               yeah.

     a beat.

                         kevin
               i can't believe we just had our senior
               prom.

                         vicky
               yeah, the time went by so fast.

                         kevin
               it did.

     another beat.

                         vicky
               kevin, next year...with you in ann
               arbor, and me in nashville...it's not
               gonna work, is it.

                         kevin
               don't say that, we can do it somehow.
               it might not be perfect, but --

                         vicky
                   (interrupting)
               no, kevin --
                   (she sits up)
               that's the whole thing, that's what
               i've been realizing.  that nothing's
               perfect, that you can't plan
               everything.

     kevin thinks this over.

                         kevin
               it is far away...and we'll be on our
               own...meeting new people...

     a moment as they think this over.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               vicky...last night...i wasn't lying.

                         vicky
               i know.
                   (a beat)
               let's go.  don't you have something to
               tell your friends?

                         kevin
               what?

                         vicky
               your little pact.  jessica told me all
               about it.
                   (hits him lightly)
               way to go, kev!

     kevin gives an embarrassed smile.

                                                       dissolve to:
