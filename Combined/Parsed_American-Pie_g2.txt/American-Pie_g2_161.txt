     ext. lacrosse field (msu) - day

     a scoreboard shows that east is leading by five goals.
     oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling
     the ball in his stick.  he seems to have a good lead.
     suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball.
     someone has checked him.  he lays stunned on the ground,
     as stifler recovers the ball and scores.

     the players run back to the sidelines to reset for the
     face-off, and gather around the coach.

                         coach marshall
               alright!  good hustle, guys, but we
               can still lose.  you all saw what
               happened to oz out there.  i don't
               ever want to see you guys thinking
               you're gonna score.  you don't score
               until you score, period.

     the team is getting into it.  shouts of "hell yeah!"  but
     oz's got a quizzical look on his face.
