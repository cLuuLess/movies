     int. stifler's cottage - party room - night

     jim is trying to stay interested in michelle's drivel.

                         jim
               so, the end of the story is...you had
               to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

                         michelle
               yes!  and he was such a dork!  and
               everyone laughed at me, but i didn't
               care?  because it was so funny!

                         jim
                   (flat)
               okay, i get it.

                         michelle
               oh!  and then this one time?  at band
               camp?  i stuck a flute in my pussy.

     jim chokes on his beer.  michelle considers her
     revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as
     jim struggles to recover.

                         jim
               ...excuse me?!

                         michelle
               what, you think i don't know how to
               get myself off?  hell, that's what
               half of band camp is!  sex ed!

     jim is ga-ga.  he watches in disbelief as she lets her
     hair down.  and wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute.

                         michelle (cont'd)
               so are we gonna screw soon?  i'm
               getting kind of antsy.

     jim pauses in disbelief.  then --
