     int. east great falls high - near the hall of fame - day

     kevin is trying to talk to vicky.

                         kevin
               did you get the flowers?
                   (no response)
               what about the poem?

     she doesn't care.

                         kevin (cont'd)
               vicky, please don't do this.

     vicky stares him right in the eye.  strong.

                         vicky
               i'll think about it.

     she slams her locker and walks off.  jessica is nearby.
     she's overheard.

                         jessica
               ah, you'll get her back soon enough.
               that's easy, she likes you.  what you
               need to do is learn to press a girl's
               buttons.  you gotta give her what
               she's never had.

                         kevin
               what?

                         jessica
               i'll give you a hint.
                   (hot, orgasmic)
               "ohhh, yeah, yeah!"
                   (flat)
               comprende?

                         kevin
               you mean...and orgasm?

                         jessica
               you got it, stud.

                         kevin
               well...i'm pretty sure i've --

                         jessica
                   (interrupts authoritatively)
               no you haven't.

                         kevin
               but that one time --

                         jessica
                   (shaking head)
               no.

                         kevin
               well of course i'd want to give her
               that.  i mean, what do you think, i
               don't care about her?

                         jessica
               do you?

                         kevin
               of course.

                         jessica
               do you love her?

     kevin squirms.

                         kevin
               i -- i don't know, you can't ask me
               that.

                         jessica
               well, if you want to get her in the
               sack, tell her you love her.  that's
               how i was duped.

                         kevin
               i don't want to dupe her, jessica.  if
               i say it, i have to be sure i mean it.

                         jessica
               well it's up to you.  the big l, or
               the big o.

     suddenly stifler comes running up, breathless.

                         stifler
               dickhead!  you gotta see this.
