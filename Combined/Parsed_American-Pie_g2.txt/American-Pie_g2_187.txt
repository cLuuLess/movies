     ext. beach - night

     oz and heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes,
     surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring
     breeze.  stars and a lustrous moon above.

     the silence speaks.  we can see it in their eyes.
     yearning.

                         oz
               i can't think of anything to say
               that's not cheesy.

                         heather
               then don't.

     they kiss.  it's time.
