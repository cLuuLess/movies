ext.  shoveler's backyard - day

a small, typical working class backyard.  a round, aluminum above 
ground pool.  a weber grill with burgers on it. unopened packages of 
hamburger rolls.  an old vic damon record plays on a boom box.  the 
spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.

					spleen
		come on in!  the water's great!

in fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... the rest of our 
heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  no superheroes have shown 
up.  the shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand 
in line waiting for them.

					butch
				(heavy on the sarcasm)
		great picnic, dad.

					eddie jr.
		big turnout.

					roland
		are these guys real superheroes?

					lenore
		they think so.

the kids scoff...  a moment later they head back to the house with 
their burgers.

					roland
		but where's captain amazing?

					eddie jr.
		he wouldn't be caught dead here.

they go into the house.  no one says anything.  the shoveler just 
stares at the burgers on the grill.  vic damon sings. furious chugs his 
beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.

on the spleen, munching on a chlorine tablet.

					spleen
		hey, these pool mints are delicious!

raja looks at his watch.

					raja
		maybe there was traffic.

					furious
		who are we kidding?  no one's gonna show.  
		we're living in a fantasy!

					invisible boy
		come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.

					furious
		good or evil, what's the difference?

					shoveler
		there's a big difference.

					furious
		i used to believe that.  now i'm not so sure.

					raja
		roy, remember, it is all within your power.  
		the only thing that's in your way... is you.

					furious
		oh shut up.

suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  everyone immediately perks up.

					invisible boy
		they're here!

a moment later they open the gate and see... half a dozen burly guys 
wearing various superhero outfits.

					their leader
		hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?

					raja
		this is it.  come on in!

					superheroes
		all right!  party!  (etc.)

at first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are 
decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain 
capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  their leader holds a 
squeegee with a long handle... furious is suspicious.

					raja
		i am the blue raja, master of silverware.

					their leader
		i am squeegee man, and these are my compadres, 
		the invincible dudes!

the invincible dudes spot the keg.

					invincible dudes
		whoa!  brews!  party!  (etc.)

they go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling 
them down.  the raja tries to hand out some forms.

					raja
		would you mind filling out these forms; names, 
		addresses, description of superpowers, that 
		sort of thing.

					invincible dudes
		sure, dude.  no problem.  (etc.)
			(but they just toss the forms away)

on furious, watching, starting to get pissed off.

					invincible dude 1
		hey, man, like where are the babes?

					invincible dude 2
		it said on the card there'd be babes!

					raja
		actually we lied about the babes, but there's 
		plenty of burgers.

					invincible dudes
		that's false advertising!... we came all the 
		way from south champion, man!  we coulda gone 
		plinking!... we coulda gone bunqee jumping!

					squeegee man
		no babes.  no peace.

					invisible dudes (chanting)
		no babes--no peace!  no babes--no peace!  no 
		babes--no peace!

					squeegee man
		let's trash the place!

					invincible dudes
		yeah!

furious, fed up, confronts squeegee man.

					furious
		if you're a superhero, what's your power?

					squeegee man
		i am squeegee man.
			(holding it out threateningly)
		touch my squeegee... and you die.

the invincible dudes are cracking up.

					furious
		can you fly?

					squeegee man
		no.

					furious
		wanna bet?
