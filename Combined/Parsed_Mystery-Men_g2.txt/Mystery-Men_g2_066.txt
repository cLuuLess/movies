int.  the raja's dining room - day

the shades are drawn.  the raja, in full costume, quietly loads 
silverware into the secret pockets of his cape. suddenly, the light 
switches on... it's his mother.  she's caught him red handed.

					mother
		jeffrey, you thief!

					raja
		mother... it's not what you think!

					mother
		and why are you wearing that silly costume?

					raja
				   (painfully)
		because... i'm a superhero!

on his mother, shocked.

					raja
		oh, mother, i'm sorry.  i know how much you 
		wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a 
		family--but it's just not who i am!

					mother
		but... the silverware?

					raja
		i use it... to fight evil.

					mother
				(after a moment)
		jeffrey... this is wonderful.

					raja
				    (stunned)
		it is?

					mother
		i always knew that you were special.

					raja
		you did?

					mother
		ever since you were a little boy...
			(gets an idea, excited)
		come with me.
