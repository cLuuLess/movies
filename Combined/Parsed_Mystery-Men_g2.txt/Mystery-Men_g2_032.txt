int.  invisible boy's room - day

a teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of 
the great superheroes: batman, spiderman, captain amazing, etc.  
invisible boy, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the raja, mister 
furious, and the shoveler.

					furious
		so, let me get this straight.  you have the 
		power to become invisible.

					invisible boy
		yes.

					raja
		but... only when no one is looking.

					invisible boy
		yes.

					furious
		if someone looks at you, you immediately become 
		visible again.

					invisible boy
		yes.

					raja
		so you're only invisible... to yourself?

					invisible boy
		no.

					our heroes
					(hopefully)
		no?

					invisible boy
		if i look at myseif, i become visible.

					raja
		so you're only invisible, when abuolutely no 
		one is looking at you?

					invisible boy
		yes.

					furious
		so how do you know that you've ever been 
		invisible?

					invisible boy
		i just know.

our heroes are less than impressed.

					furious
		look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to 
		interview--

					invisible boy
					(desperate)
		i know i haven't got it entirely worked out 
		yet, but i've always dreamed of becoming a 
		superhero... weren't you guys ever a kid? 
		didn't you ever need someone to just give you a 
		chance?

on our heroes, looking around the room... and softening up.
