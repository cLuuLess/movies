ext.  outside the house - continuous - on furious

still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a 
frightening orange glow in an upper room...

off in the distance furious sees... the lights of the entire city 
flicker and then black out... a moment later the mansion, and the 
city's lights return to normal... as furious watches, not sure what to 
make of this.
