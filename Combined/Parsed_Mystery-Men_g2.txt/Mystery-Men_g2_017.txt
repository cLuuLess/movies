ext. street construction site - day

traffic is snarled.  horns are blasting.  tempers are frayed.

close on a hammering jackhammer... camera widens to reveal that it is 
being operated by the shoveler, dressed in work clothes.  wiped out 
from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off 
to sleep... he nods out... as his boss whacks him on the arm.

		yo! captain sominex!  get your shut-eye at 
		home, or you'll be a full time superhero!
