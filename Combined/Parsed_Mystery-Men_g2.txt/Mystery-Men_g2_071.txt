int.  lobby of the frankenstein center - continuous

as monica approaches a guard standing by the main door.

					monica
		could you tell mr. frankenstein that monica is 
		here?

					guard
		sure, doll.

back to the barn - continuous

furious stands by the herkimer, phone still in hand.  he seems 
speechless, dazed.  something inside him has changed.

					bowler
				(worried about him)
		hey... you okay?

					furious
		sure.

back to the frankenstein center - a few minutes later

casanova steps out and sees... monica, looking very sexy.

					monica
		hi.

					casanova
		i thought you'd chickened out on me.

					monica
		just wanted to... powder my nose.

his eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she 
looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.

					monica
		how 'bout giving me "the tour"?

					casanova
		why not?
