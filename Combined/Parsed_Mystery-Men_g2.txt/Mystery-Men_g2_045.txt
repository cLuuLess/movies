ext.  outside the barn - evening

furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old 
picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a 
great practice.)  raja explains the history of the situation to the 
sphinx.

					raja
		twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this 
		city were united into one great brotherhood of 
		evil, and casanova was their king.

					shoveler
		crime was rampant.  it wasn't safe to stay in 
		your home.

					bowler
		much less go outside.

					shoveler
		then captain amazing appeared.

					raja
		he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing.

					shoveler
		and this has been a pretty nice place to live 
		ever since.

					furious
				    (pissed off)
		but now casanova's back!  and we're gonna sit 
		around here all night eating pizza and telling 
		stories! hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

					sphinx
		the wise snake coils before he strikes.

					furious
				(lunges at the sphinx)
		and a skunk stinks!

furious and the sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.

					sphinx
		you drink too much.

					furious
		when are you going to take off that mask?

					sphinx
				    (pointedly)
		when i am sure i am among friends.

					raja
		roy--

					furious
				(snapping at him)
		go dance with your mother, jeffrey!

on the raja, hurt.

					sphinx
		your rage is a very great power, but it blinds 
		you to your heart.

					furious
		my heart died a long time ago.

					sphinx
		it is not dead.  it is hiding.

					furious
		blow it out your bean hole, pancho!... and to 
		hell with the rest of you!... look at you.  
		bunch of rejects.  i didn't need you before--
		and i don't need you now!
			(jumps on to his motorcycle)
		the great ones ride alone!
			(kicks the engine started)
		adios, muchachos!
			(and he rides off across the field)

on the others, watching him...

					bowler
		has he always been like this?
