ext.  dimly lit street - night

furious walks monica home.

					monica
		i admire you.

					furious
		why?

					monica
		being a superhero, wanting to save the world.  
		it's so... unselfish.

					furious
		it is?

					monica
		most people just want to make money or be 
		famous or something.  but you risk everything, 
		just to help people.

					furious
				(after a moment)
		i wouldn't mind being famous.

					monica
		who wouldn't?

in the shadows behind them... casanova follows, stalking them, as 
silent as a vampire.

					monica
		i've never been able to figure out what to do 
		with my life, which is why i guess i'm still a 
		waitress.

					furious
		nothing wrong with being a waitress.

					monica
		what's your real name?

					furious
		roy.

					monica
		have you always lived here?

he nods.

					monica
		me too... i love this stupid old town.  it's 
		noisy.  it's smelly. it's falling apart.

					furious
		it's home.

					monica
		yeah.

casanova's pov

monica, smiling, looking lovely.

close 0n casanova; he wants her...

back on furious and monica -

					monica
		i've thought of leaving, going to chicago or 
		new york, but...

					furious
		what have they got that we ain't got?

					monica
		champion's going to bounce back, and i want to 
		be here when it does.

					furious
		me, too.

					monica
		you don't seem very angry right now.

he shrugs.  and they kiss, very tenderly.

					monica
		you know what?  underneath all that anger i 
		think there's just a little boy who wants 
		everyone to love him.

					furious
		i just want to be a superhero.

					monica
		that's what i mean... 'night, roy.

she turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes 
inside, as furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. he 
really likes her.  he starts walking back down the street, past a man 
sitting on the stoop.  the man looks up.  it's casanova frankenstein.

				casanova
		going my way?

furious is caught completely by surprise--he takes a stand, ready to 
fight.

				casanova
		take it easy--take it easy.  i just want to 
		have a little chat... that was quite a number 
		you did on my car.  you've got a lot of 
		violence in you... and i like that in a guy.

furious, silent.

					casanova
		you know what the difference is between good 
		and evil, roy?

furious reacts to the fact that casanova knows his real name.

					casanova
		evil is more fun.  when you want something, you 
		just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, 
		you kill them... you seem like a very 
		frustrated guy, roy.  unhappy. unfulfilled.  
		what is it that you've always wanted, always 
		desired?  because whatever it is, i can give it 
		to you... fame?
				(snaps his fingers)
		easy.  fortune?  even easier. women?
					(laughs)
		the easiest of all.

close on furious as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement 
in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.

					casanova
		i'll let you in on a little secret, roy.  in 
		two days this entire city will belong to me, 
		and there's not a damn thing your little pals 
		can do about it.  it's the perfect time to 
		switch teams... so what do you say?

					furious
				     (quietly)
		you're nuts.

					casanova
					(flairs)
		they always call the great ones nuts.

					furious
		and the nuts always call themselves great.

					casanova
				(his psychosis showing)
		are you with me... or against me?

					furious
		against.

					casanova
		too bad.  plug him!

gunfire rings out from the alley as the disco bays step out, their 
pistols blazing.  but furious has anticipated them.  he leaps right at 
casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of 
fire.

					casanova
		wait!

the disco bqys stop firing... furious drags casanova back into an empty 
lot, using him as a shield.

					furious
				   (to casanova)
		thanks for reminding me which team i'm on.

					casanova
		you're dead.

					furious
		so are you!

furious releases casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden 
wall at the end of the lot... as the disco boys open fire again, and 
their bullets punch holes through the wall...

furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.
