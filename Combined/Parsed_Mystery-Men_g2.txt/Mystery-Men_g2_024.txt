their pov -

a group of men are hanging around the door to the house, smoking, 
chatting, and laughing.  a closer angle reveals that they are all 
dressed in the height (or depths) of seventies disco fashion.  one of 
them is showing off some steps.

our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer.

		was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

					furious
