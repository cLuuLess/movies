int. the diner - continuous - on the spleen

sitting between the bowler and a bandaged invisible boy. the bowler has 
her arm chummily around the spleen's shoulder. the spleen finally has 
real friends. doc heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the 
raja as the shoveler listens in. the sphinx sits at the end of the 
table, silent.

					doc heller
		so you're never actually conscious of range or 
		trajectory?

					raja
		heck no.  i just chuck 'em.

monica (in her waitress outfit) sits close to a bandaged mister 
furious.

on the tv -

dawn wong reports.

					dawn
		it's been twenty-four hours since the deadly 
		psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that 
		left casanova frankenstein and dozen of the 
		city's top hoodlums dead... but tonight the 
		question remains... who were these heroic 
		mystery men who saved our city?...

on our heroes -

					bowler
		could have been anybody.

they laugh.

					raja
		wait a minute... that's it.  that's our name.  
		we're... the mystery men.

they all like it, except for the bowler.

					bowler
		hey, do i look like a man?

					shoveler
		well we can't call ourselves the mystery people.

					spleen
			(singing, ala "macho man")
		mystery, mystery man... i want to be a mystery 
		man...

		  		  shoveler & raja
		shut up.

					bowler
		eat your mustard.

					furious
		it doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  we 
		know who we are.

					raja
		yes, obie-wan.

					invisible boy
		hey... he's gone.

the others see... that the sphinx's chair is empty.  raja spots a 
crumpled napkin on the table, opens it up, and reads.

					raja
		"until you need me again... adios."

a silence... reactions from our heroes as they realize that the sphinx 
is gone...

					shoveler
		i miss him already.

suddenly, somewhere in the night, a burst of gunfire and screams are 
heard.  the final music begins...

					furious
		amigos, duty calls.

the mystery men wolf their burgers, then stand and start for the 
street...

as monica watches them leave, a patron asks her:

					patron
		miss... who are those guys?

					monica
				(after a moment)
		i don't know.

just outside the diner - a moment later

heroic group shot as the mystery men merch down the middle of street, 
toward the sound of the gunfire... and into the night.

theme and credits...
