ext.  outside the frankenstein center - a little later

police cars and news vans arrive... as our heroes, battered, wounded, 
but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs...

furious and monica hold each other up.  wounded invisible boy has his 
arm around the spleen... while policemen and news people run up the 
stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...

but this time our heroes could care less.  they are superheroes, and 
they don't give a damn who knows it.
