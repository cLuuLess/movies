casanova and tony p savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars.

					casanova
		i hope you enjoy these cigars.  i had to kill a 
		dozen cubans to get them.

					tony p
		ummm.

					casanova
		have you considered my offer?

					tony p
		you know, mr. f, me and the boys always loved 
		workin' for you.  you had such style: the 
		clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd 
		snuff a babe.  you were the king...

casanova accepts this graciously.

					tony p
		but times have changed, and you been in that 
		bug house a long tine. i can see you still got 
		the style, but i dunno for sure you still got 
		the edge.

					casanova
		i got it.

					tony p
		what about captain amazing?

					amazing (o.s.)
		good question.

casanova and tony p look up and see captain amazing, posed noncalantly 
on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.  tony p jumps out of his 
chair, scared.  but casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as 
a cucumber.

					casanova
		i knew you'd cone.  i left that skylight open 
		for you.

					amazing
		i know you did.

					casanova
		i knew you'd know.

					amazing
		i know you knew i'd know.

					casanova
		but did you know i knew you'd know i'd know?

					amazing
		of course.

tony p makes a move for his pistol, but captain amazing instantly whips 
out his pistol, getting the drop on him.

					amazing
		i'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of 
		scum like you, tony.

tony freezes.

					amazing
		the jig is up, casanova.  i've spent six months 
		watching you, and know exactly what you're up 
		to.

					casanova
		really?

					amazing
		i know that you're recruiting your old 
		henchmen...

nervous reaction from tony p.

					amazing
		i know who your girlfriend really is...

icy reaction from anabel.

					amazing
		and i know the terrible revenge that you plan 
		to inflict on this city.

					casanova
		i guess you know just about everything, don't 
		you, lance?

					amazing
		um-hmm.

					casanova
		except for one little thing.

					amazing
				(supremely confident)
		and what's that?

					casanova
		that i've hot wired the city's entire power 
		supply through that catwalk.

					amazing
		what--?

casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a 
million volts instantly fills the room...
