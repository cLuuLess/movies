ext.  waterfront - night

the convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter, docked at the 
pier.

casanova's men throw the gate of the truck open, and the camera moves 
in.  no one is there, but we notice... two large lumps under the 
packing blankets.

casanova holds anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate 
being lowered from the deck of the freighter.

					casanova
		honey, our ship's come in.

casanova's cellular phone rings.

outside the diner - continuous

the disco boy is on his phone.  his pistol is drawn, and he's got it 
aimed right at furious' head.

					disco boy
		just give me the word.

back to the pier - continuous - on casanova

					casanova
				   (gets an idea)
		wait.  i'll be right there.
				(hangs up, starts off)

					anabel
				     (peeved)
		where are you going?

					casanova
		head hunting.

a minute later casanova and two or three disco boys drive off in one of 
the sedans... as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is 
pulled closed... and locked.

inside the truck - a moment later

the engine starts up, and the truck starts to move, as invisible soy 
and the spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets... 
they approach the crate and invisible boy shines his flashlight on it.  
the crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands; there's no way 
they're going to be able to get inside it, but in the light of the 
flashlight they see...

faded red lettering, in russian, and the distinctive old hammer and 
sickle of the former soviet union.
