ext.  a bar - later that night - establishing

a very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...

inside the bar - continuous

our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.

					shoveler
		to us!

					raja
		whatever our name is.

they toast and drink.

the same - later

the spleen is passed out at a table, snoring. shoveler and invisible 
boy sit next to him.

					shoveler
		even his snores smell bad.

raja and bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.

					bowler
		but she's your mother.  you gotta tell her.

					raja
		i can't.

on shoveler and invisible boy

					invisible boy
		dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid 
		waste of time.

					shoveler
		but he plays golf, right?

					invisible boy
		yeah.

back on raja and bowler -

					raja
		i'm her only son, and she always had such high 
		hopes for me. medicine.  law.

					bowler
		but you're a superhero.

					raja
		the cape.  the turban.  she wouldn't 
		understand.

					bowler
		i know... my girlfriends all dumped me after i 
		put on the mask.  they thought i'd lost it.

					raja
		but in fact... you'd found it.

they clink their glasses and drink.

back on shoveler and invisible boy -

					shoveler
		this is your dream... and you can't ever give 
		it up.

the spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.

					invisible boy
		i wonder what he dreams about?

					shoveler
		we don't want to know.

mr. furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry 
thoughts..

outside the bar - continuous

a black van drives slowly past the bar.

inside the van - continuous

the van is packed with disco boys.  tony p sits in the front seat.

					tony p
		there.

his pov -

he has spotted the ford esquire parked in the lot.

back in the bar - a little later

on the bowler and raja -

					bowler
		it's late.  i'm headin' home.

					raja
		me, too.

					bowler
				(to invisible boy)
		come on, junior, it's a school night.

just outside - a monent later

as our heroes, carrying the spleen, leave.

					furious
		anybody up for a little white castle?

but suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they 
are bushwhacked by the disco boys...
