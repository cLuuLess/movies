int.  the shoveler's house - day

the shoveler, standing in his bedroom, has just put on his freshly 
laundered suit.  camera opens wide to reveal lucille, his wife, 
standing there, holding his just polished shovel. he takes it from her, 
then takes her in his arms.

					shoveler
		baby, if i don't make it... find yourself... a 
		normal guy.

					lucille
		i don't want a normal guy.

and they kiss.

a few minutes later... in the living room the shoveler's kids lie 
sprawled in front of the television.  the shoveler, in battle array, 
steps into the room.  be wants to say something to them, but the kids 
don't even take their eyes off the tv look at him... he turns and walks 
out in silence.

end music...
