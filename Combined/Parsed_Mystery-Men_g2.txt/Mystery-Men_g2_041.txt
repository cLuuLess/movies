ext.	auto demolition yard - later that night

our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum. they 
sit on the ground and on old car seats, feeling like schmucks as the 
sphinx chews theu out, his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in 
the flickering light.

					sphinx
		you call yourselves superheroes? a rooster 
		fights more intelligently than you!  you have 
		shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your 
		powers to him--and what have you accouplished 
		for this?  you have destroyed his car.  
		brilliant!  if you want to survive you must 
		fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!

furious sulks, but the others get the point.

					sphinx
		the wolf is cunning.  he knows that stealth is 
		his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a 
		team...
					(more)

				sphinx (cont'd)
				(at furious)
		not like some drunken tejano on saturday night.

furious grunts.

					sphinx
		casanova frankenstein is a a master of evil.  
		you will need more than shovels and dessert 
		forks to stop him... what else have you got?

they are silent.

					furious
				     (angrily)
		so what else has superman got?

					shoveler
		he's got the fact that he's superman!

					bowler
		bullets bounce off him!

furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.

					raja
		firepower costs money.

					invisible boy
		anybody got any?

a silence.

					shoveler
		we didn't think this through very well.

					bowler
				(after a moment)
		my father had this friend... he was an inventor...
