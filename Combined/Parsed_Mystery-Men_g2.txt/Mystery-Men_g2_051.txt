		...still no sign of millionaire lance hunt, and 
		now, in an unrelated story, another one of 
		champion city's leading citizens has apparently 
		disappeared. captain amazing has not been seen 
		or heard from in a week. authorities believe 
		that the hard working superhero may just be 
		taking a well deserved rest.

just outside the diner - continuous - unknown pov

from across the street.  furious' head is clearly visible in the 
brightly illuminated window of the diner.

a disco boy stands in the shadows, gazing at the diner; he recognizes 
furious.
