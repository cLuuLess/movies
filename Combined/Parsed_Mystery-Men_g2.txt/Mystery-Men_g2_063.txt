int.  invisible boy's room - day

invisible boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating 
for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...  he suddenly pops 
opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror... but he's still 
completely visible. he flops onto his bed in frustration.
