int.  the dining room - night

the room is dark.  someone is sneaking around.  a drawer is quietly 
opened, and we hear the gentle clink of silver. suddenly, the light 
goes on and we see the blue raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and 
slacks, with his hand in the drawer.  his mother, in her nightclothes, 
stands by the door where she has just switched on the light.

					mother
		jeffrey!

					raja
		oh hi, mom.

					mother
		what are you doing in the silver drawer?

					raja
		looking for... the tv guide.

she just looks at him, very suspicious.

					mother
		it's on the television.

					raja
		of course.  i'm such a fool... thanks, mummy.  
		go to bed.

he kisses her and goes into the next room.  camera holds on mom; she 
doesn't trust him.
