ext.  outside heller's barn/lab - evening - close on

mister furious, wrench in hand, covered with grease and oil, cussing to 
himself as he works under the hood of the herkimer.

					furious
		try it again!

invisible boy, sitting behind the wheel, tries the ignition of the 
herkimer, and the old engine grinds as it turns over, but doesn't 
catch.

					furious
		come on, baby... come on, baby... i said come 
		on!

mister furious slugs the engine with his fist, and it sputters and 
backfires into life... shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but 
running... furious kisses the herkimer... as the bowler calls out to 
him from the barn.

					bowler
		mon capitan, it's for you.
				(tosses him the phone)

					furious
		hello?
