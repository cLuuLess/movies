int. shoveler's douse - night - close on a tv screen

don stouffer is reporting.

					don
		few details have emerged...

on the shoveler's kids, on the couch, still rattled by their psychotic 
episode, glued to the tv -

					don (0.s.)
		...but the dawn patrol got this exclusive 
		interview vith two of the suspects.

on the tv -

dawn wong interviews the battered, handcuffed elvis brothers as they 
are led away...

					elvis brother i
		i don't know who those guys were--but i never 
		want to see 'em again.

					elvis brother 2
		especially that big dude with the shovel...

					elvis brother 1
					 (near tears)
		he was the worst!

on the kids' collective reaction as they realize who it was... and then 
they hear the front door open...

in the front hall the shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his 
back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.

					kids
		dad!... dad!... you okay?... you hurt?

					shoveler
			   (shocked by this welcome)
		i'm okay--i'm all right.

					eddie jr.
		lean on me, dad.

					lenore
		i'll hold your shovel, dad.

they lead him back into the living room, and give him the prime spot on 
the couch.

					butch
		you want a soda, dad?

					shoveler
					(stunned)
		okay.

he runs to get it as eddie jr. slides a footstool under his feet and 
tracy puts a pillow behind his back.  roland, the little one, cuddles 
up next to him, puts his arm around him.

					roland
		nice work. dad.

					shoveler
		thanks, roland.

					roland
		you really are a superhero, aren't you?

the shoveler nods.  a few minutes later... the shoveler sits on the 
couch, feet up, soda in hand. the television is off. his kids all 
huddled around him, hanging on his every word.

					shoveler
		and that's when the engine blew up.

					kids
		whoa...

					butch
		what did you do?

					shoveler
		well...

on lucille as she comes in and sees... her husband surrounded by his 
kids, a happy man at last.
