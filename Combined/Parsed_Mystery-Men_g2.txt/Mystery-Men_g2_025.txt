int.  casanova's bedroom - continuous

casanova and dr. anabel leek are preparing for bed.  anabel sits in 
front of a huge mirror, brushing her long hair as casanova moves up 
behind her and puts his hands around her throat, massaging, squeezing, 
just barely resisting the temptation to strangle her.  (she loves it).

					casanova
		everything's going exactly as we planned.

					anabel
			(puts the sharp point of her
			comb handle under his chin)
		not quite.  you haven't announced our 
		engagement yet.

					casanova
		it must have slipped my mind.

					anabel
		your mind is so slippery.

					casanova
		don't worry, pootchkie.  my womanizing days are 
		over.  you're my lady macbeth, my imelda... my 
		nicole.
				(pulls her into his arms)
		we're such an incredible team.  who could 
		possibly stop us?
		(kisses her)
