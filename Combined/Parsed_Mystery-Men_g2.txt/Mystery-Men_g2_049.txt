ext.  the frankenstein mansion - continuous

armed disco boys guard the front entrance...

while on the hillside above invisible boy (looking through binoculars) 
and the spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds, keeping the 
mansion under surveillance.

					spleen
				  (in a whisper)
		adolescence was the worst--the other kids made 
		fun of me, so i'd spit on them and they'd 
		scatter--i've never had a girlfriend--unless 
		you count that night with my cousin--she 
		recovered fully though--we exchange cards every 
		christmas--well, i send her one, and she sends 
		it back...
			(spritzes somathing into his mouth,
			then offers it to invisible boy)
		bug repellent?

suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans... followed 
by a truck, drive out...

pov through binoculars -

casanova and anabel sit in the front of the truck.

					invisible boy (0.s.)
		where are they going?

invisible boy hesitates for just a momnt, then gets up and runs down 
the hill.

					spleen
				(runs after him)
		kid!

as the small convoy drives past, invisible boy slips out from behind 
some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper.  
the spleen comes running after him, and invisible boy reaches out, 
grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him.  invisible boy tries the 
rear gate.  it's open. the two of them pull it up just a foot, squirm 
inside, then pull it closed behind them.

inside the truck - continuous

invisible boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the 
inside of the truck.  there is nothing in it, except for a large pile 
of packing blankets.
