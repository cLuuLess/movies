ext.  streets of champion city - night

various shots as the herkimer rumbles and smokes down champion's main 
street (in first gear) and the citizens step out of houses and bars to 
watch this bizarre sight.

on a little boy and his father -

					little boy
		daddy, what is that thing?

					father
		i don't know, son.

a couple of grizzled characters stand in front of a bar.

					drunk
		a herkimer?  those yuppies will drive anything.

inside the herkimer - continuous

on furious and the others in the back.

					sphinx
		amigo, we need you.

					invisible boy
		just get mad!

furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.
