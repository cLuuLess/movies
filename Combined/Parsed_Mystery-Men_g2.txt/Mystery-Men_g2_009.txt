ext.  residential street - night

the shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. the 
front yard looks like a battle zone.  bikes and kids' junk are 
everywhere.

living room - a moment later

as big a disaster area as the front yard. his kids, eddie jr. (15), 
lenore (12), butch (10), tracy (7), and roland (5) are all sprawled in 
front of the television. the shoveler enters, and his kids don't even 
bother to look up from the tube.

					shoveler
		hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place 
		up?

					tracy
		when you're on tv.

					eddie jr.
		right--like that will ever happen.

					lenore
		save any babies lately?

on the shoveler, silent, hurt.

					tracy
		faster than a speeding turtle--

					butch
		more powerful than a deodorant--

					eddie jr.
		able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--

					lenore
		look, snoring in his chair--

					eddie jr.
		sitting on the john--

					all
		it's... supergut!

the kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well) as the 
shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen.
