ext.  erie hospital for the criminally insane - day

camera moves through a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally coming 
into view of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by 
towers and gun turrets.  screaming and horrible laughter is heard from 
within...

close on a sign that reads "erie hospital for the criminally insane" 
... this is where the worst killers and psychos go.
