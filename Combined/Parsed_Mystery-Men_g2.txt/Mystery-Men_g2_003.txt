int.   the car - a moment later

casanova and anabel drive off.  the massive old hospital is seen 
through the rear window behind them, as casanova calmly looks at his 
watch...

close on his watch -

as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  it is exactly twelve 
noon...

back on casanova -

					casanova
				(almost wistfully)
		boom.

and the hospital explodes in a huge fireball that completely consumes 
it.

					casanova
		those gas leaks can be murder.
