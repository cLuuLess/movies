int.  the diner - night

furious, the shoveler, and the raja all sit at their booth.

					furious
		i saw him go in--and he didn't come out!
	
					raja
		but we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

furious groans.

					shoveler
		hey, look.

on the tv -

casanova is being interviewed by don stouffer, the local mike wallace.

					casanova
		well, don, i've done some terrible things in my 
		life, but now i'm cured, and i just want to 
		give back something to my old home town... 
		that's why i'm using what's left of my fortune 
		to build...

close on a model of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure 
(i.e.  the getty)

					casanova (o.s.)
		the frankenstein center for the arts.

					don
		you've changed, haven't you?

		casanova
		oh yes.

back on furious, raja, and shoveler - 

					furious
		no he hasn't.
