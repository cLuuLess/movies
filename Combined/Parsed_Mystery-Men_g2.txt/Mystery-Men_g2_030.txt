int.  the restaurant - continuous

our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch.  
furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.

					furious
		you sure that's how you spell it?

					shoveler
		yeah.

close on the note -

which reads "spinks, we need you."

they crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant... a moment later a 
shy looking mexican man busses their tray... but in a close angle we 
see him secretly pocket the napkin.
