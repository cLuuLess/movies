int.  the diner - continuous - close on a tv screen

on which captain amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being 
interviewed by dawn wong.  he's playing the cutsy photo op for all its 
worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  dawn is creaming.

our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the 
tube...

					raja
				(nursing a sore jaw)
		he doesn't miss a trick, does he?

					furious
		what a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!

					shoveler
		oh don't start that again--

					furious
		look!

furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good 
looking guy in a tux at a benefit... the headline reads "lance hunt 
hosts benefit."  he holds the picture up next to the television, so the 
faces of lance hunt and captain amazing are side by side.  it is 
obviously the same guy.

					furious
		he's lance hunt!  just take off the glasses--
		and it's him!

					raja
		there's a vague similarity.

					furious
		a vague similarity?  it's the same guy!

					shoveler
				(downing some aspirin)
		0h, who gives a damn who he is? i can't take 
		this anymore.  night after night we're on the 
		streets, busting our humps--and for what?

					raja
		we take the licks and he gets the chicks.

					shoveler
		how long do you have to chase a dream before 
		you realize it's not gonna happen?

					furious
		we need a break, that's all! nobody'd ever 
		heard of him until he busted casanova 
		frankenstein!

					raja
		but look at him... and look at us.

					shoveler
		the camera loves him.

a depressed silence.  furious turns his attention to the napkin 
dispenser.

					furious
				     (furious)
		why do they always fill stuff these things so 
		full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 
		'em!
				   (rips one out)

					raja
		i lost another fork tonight.  she's getting 
		suspicious, i know it.

					furious
		so why don't you just tell her!

					raja
		i can't.

					furious
		why not?

					raja
				     (upset)
		because i can't!  okay?  she wouldn't 
		understand!

					shoveler
		leave him alone.  she's his mother, not yours.

					furious
		we had an off night, that's all.

					shoveler
		so when are we gonna have an on night?

a waitress is standing at the table.

					waitress
		hi.

they look at her, taken aback.  she's very pretty.

					raja
		you're... new.

					waitress
		it's my first night.  my name's monica.

close on furious, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her.  
under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

					monica
		you guys going to a costume party?

					raja
		we're superheroes.

					monica
		really?  like captain amazing?

furious growls.

					monica
		are you famous?

					raja
		not yet.

					monica
		so you're like... struggling superheroes?

					raja
		we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... i 
		am the blue raja, master of silverware...
				(does a very impressive
				little flipping thing with
				his place setting)

					monica
		wow.

					raja
		and these are my associatiates, the shoveler.
	
					shoveler
		hi.

					raja
		and mister furious... his anger is his power.

					monica
				(intrigued by furious)
		really?

					raja
		usually a superpower is a magical endowment or 
		a great skill.  in his case, it's entirely 
		emotional.

					monica
		so what can i get you?

					raja
		burgers all around.
				(meaning himself)
		medium.
				(meaning the shoveler)
		rare.
				(meaning furious}
		raw.

a moment later as monica walks away, furious can't help but
watch her.  the raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good 
stuff from his coat.

					raja
		she likes you.

					shoveler
		definitely.

					raja
		ask her out.

					furious
		nah.

					raja
		roy, when was the last time you had an actual 
		date?

					furious
				(getting very pissed off)
		what does it matter?  women just want to 
		control you--and talk about their feelings.  
		they want to know why you're angry all the 
		time--and what can they can do to help--so you 
		tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave 
		me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and 
		they bug you--until you just can't stand it 
		anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like 
		a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all 
		your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all 
		of it!
					(after a beat)
		and then they dump you.

					raja
		so you're chicken?

					furious
				     (fiercely)
		who's chicken?
					(gets up)

monica stands at the counter placing her order.  furious approaches 
her, leans against the counter.  for a moment he just stands there, 
fuming, unable to think of anything to say. she isn't sure what to make 
of this.

					furious
		doesn't it piss you off the way the when you 
		really want to talk to somebody you can't think 
		of anything to say!

					monica
		i guess... are you always so angry?

					furious
		only when i'm awake... you busy after work?

she shrugs.

					furious
		want to go out and get drunk?

she's visibly turned off by that.

					furious
		or talk?

					monica
		not tonight.
			(picks up an order and walks away)
