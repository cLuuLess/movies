ext.  courtyard - a moment later - angle on

the security eye watching...

as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.

back to casanova -

as he types something into the security computer...

on the screen a computerized image of the eye appears. casanova 
highlights the word "activate" and then presses "enter".

back to the courtyard - on the eye

as it comes to glowing, sinister life...

a hapless guard retreats under the arch--the eye instantly focuses on 
him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that sizzle 
him...

a moment later our heroes arrive at the arch.  furious is about to run 
through, but doc heller holds him back.

					heller
		wait!  look!

he points to... a man shaped pile of charcoal, all that remains of the 
unfortunate guard.

					heller
		laser eye... and it's a humdinger.

					raja
		no problem.

the raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the 
eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into... 
a formless blob of silver.

back to casanova and the top crooks -

					tony p
		we'll take care of these clowns.

					elvis brother 2
		piece a cake.

					bone head leader
		no sweat.

corridor - a moment later

as tony p, the top crooks, and the disco boys march en masse toward the 
camaera... they are an ugly, formidable looking bunch.
