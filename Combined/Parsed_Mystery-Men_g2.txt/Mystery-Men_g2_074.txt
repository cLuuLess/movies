ext.  the barn/lab - night

the bowler, spleen, invisible boy, and doc heller load up the herkimer 
with heller's weaponry...

as mister furious lies sprawled on the hillside... breathing in the 
night air, contemplating a dandelion gone to seed, and listening to the 
sounds of the night.  the raja, shoveler, and sphinx, stand nearby, 
watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.  a whippoorwill 
is heard singing.

					furious
		listen.  he's lonely... and he doesn't care who 
		knows it.

raja and shoveler share a bewildered look.  the bird sings again.

					furious
		we're all the same really.  our songs, our 
		dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt 
		to live forever.
			(blows the dandelion seeds into the wind)

					sphinx
		he is in love.  his anger is gone.

					raja
		oh no.

					shoveler
		great timing!
	
					furious
		has monica called?
