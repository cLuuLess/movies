int.  top of the frankenstein tower - continuous

casanova leads monica into... a palatial room, filled with priceless 
objects d'art, all of which reflect casanova's dark psyche.  a munch 
painting.  mayan idols.  weird german furniture.  a huge glass 
chandelier hovers over the room.  a massive bronze sculpture of a wolf 
(done in the same style as the other sculptures) is perched in the 
balcony.  it seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a 
spectacular view, spread out alonq the lakeshore below.

					casanova
		this is where i come to... be alone.

he turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to 
the room.

close on monica, sensing her danger.

					monica
		oh, look at that view.

she moves out onto the balcony... as casanova slips the gold chain from 
around his neck and follows her.
