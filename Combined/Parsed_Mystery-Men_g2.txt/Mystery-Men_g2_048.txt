int.  the diner - night - close on furious

sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on 
his face; he is still that little boy.  the dean martin song is playing 
on the juke.

					monica (0.s.)
		hi.

he looks up and sees monica.

					furious
		hi.

					monica
		alone tonight?

					furious
		every night.

she smiles.
