ext.  hilltop - night - angle on

a billboard overlooking the city.  captain amazing is posed wearing a 
pair of bright blue nikes.  the caption reads. "it's a nice world.  
sonebody's got to save it... the nike supershoe.  it's amazing."

furious sits on his harley, taking long hauls from a pint bottle of 
cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign.

					furious
		amazing?  what's so amazing about him?  i'd be 
		amazing, too, if i'd inherited two hundred 
		million bucks... or two bucks... or two 
		cents...
			(hurls the empty bottle, smashing
				it against the sign)
		who am i kidding?  dreams don't come true.

a moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and 
looks up...

his pov -

as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above 
him...

it is captain amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...


					furious
		where's he going?
			(kicks his harley started)

series of shots - with music

as furious, following captain amazing, rides roughshod down the steep 
hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential 
area...

he cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and 
rides smoothly along it, following amazing... he turns off the tracks, 
rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and 
sees..

a foreboding looking old mansion... captain amazing lands on the 
highest part of its roof... furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates 
of the mansion...

his pov -

letters across the iron gates read... "frankenstein".
