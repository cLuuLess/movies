int.  the diner - later - close on

furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. the three of 
them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and 
groaning... monica approaches.  she's made them ice packs and cold 
compresses.

					monica
		here you go.
			(sits with them, applies a compress
				to the raja's head)

					raja
		ow.

					monica
		maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero 
		stuff and join kiwanis or something.

a fussy customer is calling out from another table.

					fussy custorer
		miss!

she moves off.

					raja
		maybe she's right.

					furious
				(still furious)
		are you serious? this is the break we've been 
		waiting for!

					shoveler
		what are you talking about?

					furious
		what have the famous superheroes got that we 
		don't?

					raja
		agents?

					furious
		archenemies!  casanova isn't just a criminal--
		he's a supervillain. stopping him could be our 
		ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!

					shoveler
		and it would be the right thing to do.

					furious
				   (dismissively)
		yeah yeah--and that, too.

					raja
		but there's only three of us, and he's got the 
		entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.

					furious
		then maybe it's time for us to form our own 
		brotherhood...
					(more)
	
					furious (cont'd)
		a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, 
		skull cracking, disco boy bashing, warriors of 
		the night!

					shoveler
		i'm liking this.

					furious
		i say we send out the word--and summon all of 
		the unsung superheroes we know!

					raja
				(after a moment)
		yeah, but... who do we know?

they take a long moment to ponder this.

					furious
		well... there's the spleen.

shoveler and raja make disgusted noises.

					raja
		do we have to?

					shoveler
		i got this cousin.  he's a real doofus, but he 
		claims he can become invisible.

					furious
		have you ever seen him?

					shoveler
		how could i see him if he's invisible?

					furious 
		good point.

					raja
		and there's the sphinx.

					shoveler
		the who?

					raja
		he's a legendary masked mexican crime fighting 
		superwrestler and master of the machete.

					furious
		sounds good.

					raja
		no one's sure that he actually exists, but they 
		say he can be contacted by leaving a message on 
		a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by 
		the bus station.

					shoveler
		get outta here.
