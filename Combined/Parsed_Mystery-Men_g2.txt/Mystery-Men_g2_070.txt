ext.  unknown location - evening - close on monica

					monica
			(on a phone, speaking very softly)
		it's me.

back to furious - continuous

					furious
		monica, where are you?

back to monica - wider angle

revealing that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center.  
she's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed 
for a date.  disco boys and security guards go about their business all 
around her.

					monica
		at the frankenstein center.

cut back and forth between them -

					furious
		are you nuts?  get out of there!

					monica
		i'm going inside.

					furious
		what are you talking about?

					monica
		listen, casanova may be a supervillain, but 
		he's got a weakness, and i'm it.  maybe--just 
		maybe--i can trick him into showing me the 
		location of the whatchamathing.

					furious
		he's a psycho!  he'll kill you!

					monica
		just shut up and listen.  hold off the attack 
		as long as you can.  if i can discover the 
		location i'll call you--

					furious
		and what if you get killed?

					monica
		then at least i will have died trying, right?

furious silent, taken aback by her courage.

					monica
		roy... we might never see each other again, so 
		i'd better tell you now...  i think you're 
		wonderful.

					furious
			(caught completely off guard)
		what?

					monica
		bye.
				(and she hangs up)

					furious
		monica!
