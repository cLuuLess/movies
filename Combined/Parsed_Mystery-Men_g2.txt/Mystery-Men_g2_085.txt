ext.  front gate of the frankenstein center - continuous

a pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the spleen) 
are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the 
hill straight for them.

					guard 1
		what the hell is that?

					guard 2
		looks like... a ford dumpster.

they have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to 
stop...  but the herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates 
and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.

					guards
		hey!

they open fire.

inside the herkimer - continuous

bullets are heard pinging off the herk as through the windshield just 
ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art 
center.

					shoveler
		hang on!
