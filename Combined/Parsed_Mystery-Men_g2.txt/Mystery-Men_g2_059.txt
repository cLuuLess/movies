int.  doc heller's barn/lab - later

our heroes and monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

					monica
		what could have made such a horrible noise?

					heller
			  (after a moment, gravely)
		he's got the psychostridulator.

					all
		the what?

					heller
		ten years ago the kremlin's top secret 
		psychiatric warfare division developed a 
		prototype for a weapon that emitted a 
		fluctuating alternative frequency noise that 
		produced a violent psychotic reaction in any 
		mammal within hearing distance.  but when the 
		old soviet union fell the stridulator and its 
		brilliant inventor, doctor kopov, disappeared.

					shoveler
		this kopov, what happened to him?

					heller
		not him... her.

they react to that piece of news, and then the bowler opens up the 
newspaper.

					bowler
		did she look like that?

close on a photo of anabel and casanova, announcing their wedding 
engagement.

					heller
		yes.

silence; this is bad.

					spleen
				    (hopefully)
		maybe it won't work.

					furious
		it works.

					heller
		a village in siberia was wiped out when a 
		cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.

another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.  
for the first time, they're really scared.

					monica
		we've got to warn the city.

					shoveler
		how?

					raja
		no one will believe us.

					bowler
		they'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

camera cuts between them as they look at each other--their frightened 
faces, their sad, faded costuznes.  even the sphinx looks scared.

					furious
			   (after a moment, grimly)
		we know what we gotta do.

they look at him.

					raja
		we're outnumbered twenty to one.

					shoveler
		it's suicide.

					furious
		maybe.  but this isn't about living or dying.  
		it's about good versus evil, and we're good, 
		whether we like it or not... maybe we look a 
		little funny...

on the spleen...

					furious
		and smell a little funny.  we're not 
		bulletproof and we can't fly. but we're 
		superheroes--and that means doing what's right-
		-even when it's impossible... this is our city-
		-these are our friends, our famlies--and if we 
		don't save them, nobody will!  so i say we take 
		a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, 
		destroy that psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach 
		those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

					sphinx
		now you're talking.

					bowler
		sounds good to me.

					raja
		let's do it.

					shoveler
		and we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!

they're all with him.  monica steps forward.

					monica
		i just want you guys to know--i may not be a 
		superhero, but i'm with you--and i want to 
		help!

					all
		oh that's great... thanks, monica...  (etc.)

					bowler
		we could really use some coffee--

					shoveler
		and some sandwiches--

					spleen
		with mustard!

					monica
			(her feelings a little hurt)
		sure.

a few minutes later, monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes 
plan...

					raja
		but that place is huge and we don't know where 
		this psycho thing is--

					bowler
		or even what it looks like.

					heller
		and he must have it well hidden.

					furious
		we'll just have to get lucky.

on monica as she gets an idea.  a moment later she slips a canned 
tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each 
other in a group huddle\embrace.

					furious
		go do what you gotta do.  we'll meet back here 
		at sunset... do or die.

					all
		do or die.

					sphinx
		victoria o morte.

heroic music as...
