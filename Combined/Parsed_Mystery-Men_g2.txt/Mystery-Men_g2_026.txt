ext.  the lawn - continuous - on our three heroes

as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.

					raja
		don't crunch the leaves.

					shoveler
		sorry.

					raja
		be a mohican.
	    		   (bumps into a lawn chair)

					furious
		wait.
				(they all stop.)
		i hear something.

they all listen; there is a low rushing sound... it is the sound of 
water rushing through pipes.  suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop 
up... and our heroes get drenched.  they duck off the lawn, behind the 
cover of a large tree.

					raja
		i'm soaked.
				    (sneezes)
		oh great.

					furious
		shhh.

					shoveler
		be a mohican. 

					raja
		shut up.

furious sees a pair of french doors, off a small patio.  one of the 
doors is slightiy open.

					furious
		come on.

they start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip 
the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in 
light.

					raja
		uh-oh.

as our heroes look around as a dozen disco boys, armed with pipes, 
chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... the 
french doors open and tony p steps out.

					raja
		oh i'm sorry.  we must have the wrong house.

					tony p
		you sure do.

the disco boys attack.  the raja is instantly clubbed down. the 
shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes 
down, too... these guys are not the red eyes.

only furious holds his own.  he grabs a pipe away from one of them and 
swings fiercely, keeping the others off.  suddenly, the disco boys pull 
back.  furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...

casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.

					casanova
		hi there.

with a cat-like move casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and 
repeatedly--across furious' face.  furious, stunned with pain, lunges 
at casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast 
combination of spinning disco kicks.  finally he lassos the chain 
around furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.

on the disco boys, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...

casanova releases furious, who slumps to the ground.  casanova steps 
away, and the disco boys gather around furious and kick him 
viciously... as casanova and tony p watch, amused, chuckling.

					casanova
		superheroes.

					tony p
		should i kill them?

					casanova
				(completely disdainful)
		why bother?
