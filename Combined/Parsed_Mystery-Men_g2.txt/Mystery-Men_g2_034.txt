int.  invisible boy's room - night - with music

invisible boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little 
notes on small file cards.  (he's made a whole pile of them.)

close on the note -

which reads "got superpowers?  want to fight evil?  then join us and 
let's party hearty!  beer!  burgers!  babes!"

series of shots - music continues

as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where 
lonely superheroes night find them...

the raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...

the shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...

mr. furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone 
booth...

at an abandoned drive-in movie theater... invisible boy walks through 
the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...

a white castle hamburger joint... inside the pay toilet spleen is 
scratching something on the wall with a nail. he stops and admires his 
handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the 
wall...

end music.
