ext.  loading dock - a few minutes later

the crate is being carried away by a forklift... a beat, and then 
invisible boy and the spleen slip out of the empty truck...

and run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open.  
they're just about to pass safely through them, when a pair of armed 
security guards, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.

					guard 1
		freeze!

					guard 2
		hands up!

they freeze, their hands held high.

					guard 2
		what are you two doing here?

our heroes are mute.

					guard 1
		not talking, eh?  that can be fixed.  turn 
		around, start walking up the hill--

					guard 2
		and no funny business.

invisible boy and the spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the 
hill, the guards right behind them.

					spleen
			(after a moment, to invisible
				boy, in a whisper)
		pinch 'em.

invisible boy pinches his nostrils--and the spleen lets out with a 
horrendous fart.  the guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as 
our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.
