ext.  the back of the yard - a minute later

in a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard sally and furious stand 
looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. it is a herkimer battle 
jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier 
(designed by the pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on 
battlefield fact finding tours).  overgrown with weeds, home to an 
extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are 
over.

					sally
		how many times i gotta tell you about this?

					furious
		sally, that's a herkimer battle jitney!  they 
		don't make 'em like that anymore.  it's a 
		classic!

					sally
		it's a hunk of junk.  i want the iron.  do it!

she walks away.  furious growls.  he picks up his iron bar and is about 
to wedge it under the front bumper of the herkimer...

his pov -

but the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at 
hint, imploring him for one last chance...

and he just can't do it.  he throws away his iron bar and climbs inside 
the cab of the herkimer...

in the cab - continuous

furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat-up old 
dashboard, then turns on the radio, which, miraculously still works.  
he tunes in a local station, puts his feet up on the dash.

					radio announcer
		...and continues to deny any knowledge of the 
		incident... in local news, millionaire lance 
		hunt has apparently disappeared...

on furious, taking immediate notice.

					radio announcer
		members at his household told police that the 
		playboy philanthropist failed to return home 
		last night after "going out for a walk".  
		police say they have no reason yet to suspect 
		foul play, but a search is under way...
