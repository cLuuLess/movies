ext.  the yard - day

a giant press mashes an old car... while nearby mister furious does the 
job by hand, demolishing an old grand prix with an iron bar.  he does 
it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping 
off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing 
the pieces onto a big pile... his big boned, red faced boss sally is 
calling out to him.
