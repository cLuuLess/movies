ext.  shoveler's backyard - a moment later

our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.

					bowler (o.s.)
		who died?

they look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to 
make of her.

					raja
		who are you?

					bowler
		i'm the bowler.

					shoveler
		the bowler?  i remember him from when i was a
		kid.  he was killed years ago.

					bowler
		i'm his daughter.

our heroes share a look.

					shoveler
		look, honey, being a superhero... it's a
		guy thing.

					bowler
		really?

she takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like 
a harlem globetrotter).  for a long moment she just looks at them, 
smiling.

on the others watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...

suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the 
ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war 
club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...

then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... it shoots 
straight through invisible boy's legs...

on a neatly placed collection of plaster lawn dwarves -

as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... it goes into a 
reverse spin, passes through invisible boy's legs again, and returns to 
the bowler who is holding its bag open for it... the ball rolls in.

					bowler
		good ball.

on our heroes, left absolutely speechless.

					bowler
		if it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be 
		impressed, right?

she turns and walks out.  our heroes share an amazed look, then run 
after her...

just outside the gate - on the bowler

walking away... as furious catches up with her.

					furious
		hey... can i buy you a beer?

					bowler
		i thought you'd never ask.

she takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the shoveler's 
backyard... but the camera pans across the street to the dark place 
between two houses, where a man wearing a strange steel mask with a 
frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep 
shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  we do not 
know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

back at the barbecue - a little later - close on

a faded old snapshot of the original "the bowler" holding a little girl 
in his arms.

					bowler (o.s.)
		he was more than just a superhero...  he was my 
		father...

the others, touched by this, have gathered around the bowler, who is 
holding the old snapshot in her hand.

					bowler
		and then one day, he didn't come home.  the 
		police said it was an accident.  but cargo 
		containers don't just fall on people.  he was 
		murdered... after that i fell apart.  i dropped 
		out of school, became a mud wrestler, married 
		and divorced a jerk.  when my mother died i hit 
		bottom... but then, when i was cleaning out her 
		attic, i found my father's old bowling bag and 
		costume, almost like he'd left them there for 
		me... and i knew what i had to do.

					shoveler
		so who killed him?
	
					bowler
		the disco boys.

					furious
		you know something? those guys are really 
		starting to piss me off!

					shoveler
		but there's still only six of us.

					furious
		so what?

					bowler
		that's two more than the fantastic four.

					furious
		half a dirty dozen!

					spleen
		twice the three stooges!

					invisible boy
		and only one short of the magnificent seven.

					raja
		and you can't count horst buckholtz anyway.

					bowler
		he was cute though.

					raja
		but they all had one thing we haven't got.

					spleen
		girlfriends?

					raja
		a name.  all the great superhero teams have got 
		a fabulous name.

they all think about it for a moment.  you can almost smell their 
brains overheating.

					bowler
		how about... the savage six?

					raja
		the inscrutable six?

					spleen
		the six pistols?

					shoveler
		the exterminators!

					invisible boy
		the obliterators!

					raja
		the eradicators!

					bowler
		the emasculators!

					spleen
		wait--i got it!... the spleen team.

he gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.

					furious
		to hell with a name.  let's get to work.

music up as furious stands and starts out.  the others stand and follow 
him... as our heroes form up for their first heroic group shot.
