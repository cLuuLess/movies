	145 int. ben's motel room - night
		
	sera comes in, closing the door behind her. the shades are 
	drawn and the room is gloomy. ben has got back into bed. she 
	comes to the bed and sits.
	
				sera
		ben... i've been looking for 
		you. have you been here since 
		you left? it smells bad in 
		here. it's so dark.
		
	she clicks on the bedside light and is truly shocked by his 
	face.
	
				ben
		i wanted to see you... 
	
				sera
		oh, ben... you look so very 
		sick... my love... you're so 
		pale.
	
	she goes to the bathroom and returns with a wet face-cloth. 
	she wipes his face.
	
				ben
		i wanted to see you... you're 
		my angel.
	
	he sits up painfully and finds a bottle, summoning up some 
	last strength to drink. his entire body shudders as he drains 
	the bottle. he puts it down and focuses on her for the first 
	time. h sees her damaged face, touches her face, looks at her 
	questioningly.  
	
				sera
		something went wrong... i'm 
		ok.
	
	ben begins to cry and that sets her off.
	
				ben
		i'm sorry i put us asunder.
	
	she shakes her head, unable to speak for the moment. she gets 
	into bed with him, kissing his face. she caresses his whole 
	body, which is shaking, possessed by an uncontrollable fever.
	
				ben
		see how hard you make me 
		angel. 
	
	she excites him with her hand, kissing his face gently. when 
	he is about to come, she straddles him and brings him inside. 
	as he comes, he opens his eyes wide and looks at her.
		
				ben
		you know i love you... yeah? 
	
	
	
				sera
			(she comes)
		yes.
	
	slow fade to black:
