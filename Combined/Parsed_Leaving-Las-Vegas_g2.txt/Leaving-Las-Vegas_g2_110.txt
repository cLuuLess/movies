	109 int. motel room - day
	
	sera comes into the room.
	
				sera
		ben?
	
	she sees that he is already asleep on the bed, his half-naked 
	body covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue. the 
	image has an almost religious feel to it. the tv is on and a 
	sitcom is playing.
	
	something funny catches sera's attention. she laughs and sits 
	on the bed next to ben.

		i think we realized that we 
		didn't have long and accepted 
		it. my charm, for him, was 
		that i accepted him exactly 
		as he was and didn't expect 
		him to change. i think we 
		both realized that about each 
		other. ben needed me and i 
		liked his drama. i loved him.
