	96 int. shopping mall bar. day
	
	ben needs a drink badly but this is not the best place. 
	mothers with children, old people and a waitress with 
	attitude. ben tries to order but becomes angry when she 
	doesn't bring it straight away. people begin staring. at the 
	next table a dignified older man sits alone.
	
	ben hands sera a small package.
	
	close angle
	
				ben
		there was no time for me to 
		write a card, with you 
		breathing down my neck all 
		day., so you'll just have to 
		wing it, baby.
		
	he laughs and this induces a coughing fit. he downs his drink 
	and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she 
	should bring another.
	
				ben
		open it.
	
	she does so. it is a pair of onyx earrings. black onyx set in 
	white gold.
	
				sera
			(pleased)
		your color.
	
				ben
		i think you should wear one 
		at a time. one of these... and 
		one of your others. in fact, 
		i was going to buy just one, 
			but i didn't think it would 
		fly... as a gift, i mean.
		
	his new drink arrives and he takes a swallow straight away.
	
				sera
		i'll wear them tonight... one 
		of them.
	
	she looks at him, aware of what she has said, wondering how 
	he is reacting. she smiles and ben takes a deep swallow, 
	finishing his drink. his mood suddenly changes.
	
				ben
		yes... tonight. put it on.
	
	she does so. ben helps her, bringing his face down close to 
	hers.
	
				ben
		you'll be able to feel it, 
		sharp and hot under your ear, 
		as one of the brothers is 
		driving your head, face down 
		into one of the penthouse 
		pillows.
		
	they are both suddenly deeply shocked by what he has said. 
	they sit in silence for a while. sera is close to tears. ben 
	gets up suddenly, puts down a couple of bills and walks away 
	from the table. when he is almost at the door sera gets up 
	and quickly tries together up all of the packages.
	
				sera
		ben, wait... please wait for 
		me.
	
	angle on the door
	
	the dignified older man stands in ben's path and places his 
	hands on ben's shoulders.
	
				man
		maybe you should wait for 
		her, sir.
	
				ben
		why?
	
				man
		because... you can hear in her 
		voice that she really wants 
		you to.
	
	sera catches up and the man lets go of ben. ben takes the 
		packages from sera and the two of them step out into the 
	mall.
