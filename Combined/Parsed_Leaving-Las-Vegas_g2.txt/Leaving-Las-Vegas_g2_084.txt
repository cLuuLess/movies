	83 int. sera's house - day
	
	ben is asleep on the sofa. as he wakes up, he becomes aware 
	that sera is watching him from across the room. they smile at 
	each other.
	
				ben
		how long have i been her?
	
				sera
		three nights, two days. when 
		is your rent coming up at the 
		motel?
	
				ben
		i don't know.
			(sits up)
		i'll go and sort it out 
		today. why don't you 
		come?... we'll find a real 
		room for me. you can pick it 
		out, a tower on the strip.
		
				sera
		there's no reason to blow all 
		your money on a hotel room.
		
					ben
		what do you mean?
	
				sera
		what i mean is that you 
		should bring your stuff over 
		here. we're spending all this 
		time together... what the 
		fuck!
	
				ben
		sera... 
	
				sera
		let's face it, ben, we're 
		having fun here. i've never 
		done so much talking in my 
		life.
		
				ben
			me neither.
	
				sera
		so! let's dispense with the 
		formalities. i want you 
		here... now!
	
				ben
		sera you are crazy.
	
				sera
		so... i'm not too concerned 
		with long term plans.
	
				ben
		don't you think you'll get a 
		little bored living with a 
		drunk?
	
				sera
		that is what i want. why 
		don't you go and get your 
		stuff?
		
				ben
		you haven't seen the worst of 
		it. these last few days i've 
		been very controlled. i knock 
		things over... i throw up all 
		the time.
			(looks at her)
		now i feel really 
		good... you're like some kind 
		of antidote that mixes the 
		liquor and keeps me in 
		balance, but that won't last 
		forever. you'll get tired of 
		it really quickly. believe 
		me.
		
	they sit in silence for a while.
	
				sera
		ok, you go back to your hotel 
		and i'll go back to my 
		glamorous life of being 
		alone.
		
	she walks out of the room, and into the bathroom, where she 
	sits on the toilet to pee.
	
				sera
			(to herself)
		the only thing i have to come 
		home to is a bottle of 
		listerine to wash the taste 
		of come out of my mouth. i'm 
		tired of being alone... that's 
		what i'm tired of.
		
	she finishes, wipes herself and flushes the toilet. pulling 
	up her panties, she walks back into the bedroom, where ben is 
	putting on his shoes. 
	
				sera
		don't you like me, ben?
	
				ben
			(devastated)
		don't be silly?
	
	ben is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in 
	love with her. he walks out of the room. she foolows.
	
				sera
		we gotta decide this... right 
		now. before we go any 
		further. you either stay here 
		with me or... 
	
	ben turns to look at her.
	
				sera
		... we can't see each other 
		any more.
		
	ben and sera look at each other for a long time.
	
				ben
		sera... what you don't 
		understand is... 
		 
				sera
		what?
	
	ben is deeply troubled. he comes to a decision.
	
				ben
		you can never... never... ask 
		me to stop drinking. do you 
		understand?
	
				sera
			(dead serious)
		i do. i really do.
			(smiles)
		ok. i have to do some 
		shopping alone. you go out 
		for a few drinks and then 
		pick up your things. don't 
		hurry and i'll be back before 
		you to let you in.
		
	sera grabs him in a big embrace that knocks him off balance 
	and into the wall. she kisses him all over his face and 
	squeezes his skinny frame.
