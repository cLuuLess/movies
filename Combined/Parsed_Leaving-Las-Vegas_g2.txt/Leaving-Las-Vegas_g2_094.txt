	94 ext. sera's house - morning
	
	ben lets himself in with his key. he is carrying a big bag of 
	groceries. his clothes are bloodstained. the landlady watches 
	from poolside.
	
				ben
		i'm back.
	
	he walks into the living room and finds sera reading on the 
		couch. she looks up and sees his face and his bloodstained 
	shirt.
	
				sera
		oh, no! oh, fuck, ben, look 
		at your face. you get in a 
		fight? i thought you didn't 
		fight. goddammit. how do you 
		feel? wait here. sit down.
		
	she goes to the bathroom and we hear her rummaging in the 
	medicine cabinet.
	
				sera (off-screen)
		did you stop at the bar?
	
	she comes back into the room, armed with bottles and cotton 
	wool.
	
				sera
		did you say something stupid 
		to someone stupid?
	
	she goes to work on his face, dabbing an open cut with some 
	mercurochrome.
	
				ben
		absolutely not... ow... i was 
		defending the honor of some 
		poor wayward maiden.
		
	she thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the 
	forehead.
	
				sera
		why don't you go and finish 
		this in the bathroom. take a 
		shower and put on your other 
		shirt. i'll fix breakfast and 
		then we'll go shopping and 
		get some new clothes. i think 
		this suit must be unlucky.
