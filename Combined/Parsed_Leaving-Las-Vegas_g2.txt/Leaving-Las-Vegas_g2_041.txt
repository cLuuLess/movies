	ben waiting in line to cash a check. he looks unwell and is 
	having difficulty standing straight. at last it is his turn. 
	he goes to the counter and hands over a check to the girl.
	
				bank girl
		ok... four thousand, six 
		hundred dollars... one moment, 
		sir... 
	
	she looks at her computer read-out.
	
				bank girl
		that'll leave five dollars in 
		your account. would you sign 
		the back of the check, 
		please?
		
				ben
			(surprised)
		you couldn't cash it just 
		like it is?
	
				bank girl
			(puzzled)
		i'm sorry, sir. is there a 
		problem?
	
	ben picks up a pen and tries to sign, but his hands are 
	shaking so much that he cannot do it.
	
				ben
			(embarrassed)

		i'm a little shaky right now. 
		i just had a brain 
		surgery... why don't i come 
		back after lunch, when i'm 
		feeling a little better? we 
		can take care of it then.
