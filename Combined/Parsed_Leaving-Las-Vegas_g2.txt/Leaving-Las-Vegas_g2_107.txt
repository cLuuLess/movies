		years ago, in la, i turned a 
		trick on sunset and western. 
		the guy was polite and didn't 
		argue about the price. he 
		parked his car and i took him 
		to a house that i had an 
		arrangement with. a fat 
		mexican woman was watching a 
		tv and i told him to give her 
		the twenty for the room. 
		there were three or four 
		small naked children playing 
		on the floor and we had to 
		step over them to get into 
		the room. the room had a bed 
		and a dresser. he lay on his 
		back on the bed and i put a 
		rubber on him and sucked him 
		for a while until he was hard 
		and then i eased on to him. 
		about twenty minutes later 
		there was a knock on the door 
		and it was the woman saying 
		our time was up. i felt kind 
		of guilty because he hadn't 
		come and i offered to reason 
		with the woman and get 
		another ten minutes, but he 
		said it was all right and 
		began dressing. when we were 
		ready to leave the room he 
		stopped me and... hugged me 
		and kissed me on the cheek. 
		he gave me an extra hundred 
		as a tip and went back to his 
		car. i remember being 
		relieved that i wouldn't have 
		to work again that evening.

		last spring i happened to 
		walk past a house that i had 
		once patronized. there was a 
		cool breeze blowing off the 
		ocean and through the window 
		i could see a bare leg. the 
		girl must have been taking a 
		break between customers. it 
		was a strange moment for me 
		because it reminded me of my 
		mother and despite the fact 
		that i was late for something 
		already i just stayed there, 
		loving the atmosphere of it 
		and my memory and... the 
		reason i'm telling you  this 
		epilogue is that i felt that 
		i'd come full circle.
		
				sera
		where was that house? the one 
		in la, i mean.
	
				ben
		fifth and mayflower. you know 
		it?
	
					sera
		yes. one of my friends was 
		there. i wonder if you ever 
		clipped her.
		
	they watch the tv in silence for a while. sera holds his 
	hand.
	
				ben
		i like it here with you.
	
				sera
		let's stay for a while.
	
				ben
		ok.
