	42 int. bank - day
	
	ben waiting in line again. the same bank girl is there and 
	she is dealing with her customers in the same inanely 
	cheerful way that the game-show hostess dealt with her prize-
	winners. she notices ben waiting and an irritated look 
	flashes over across her face. ben studies her. she is pretty 
	in an ordinary kind of way. we hear ben's thoughts as voice-
	over (or maybe he says them out loud to himself).
	
				ben
			(voice over)
		are you desirable? are you 
		irresistible? maybe if you 
		drank bourbon with me, it 
		would help. maybe if you 
		kissed me and i could taste 
		the sting in your mouth, it 
		would help.
	
	close-up on the bank girl as she does her thing, efficiently 
	counting money, smiling, perfect teeth framed by a cupid 
	mouth. she is wearing a white blouse through which frilly 
	lingerie can just be made out.
	
				ben
		if you drank bourbon with me 
		naked... if you smelled of 
		bourbon as you fucked me, it 
		would help... it would 
		increase my esteem for you. 
		if you poured bourbon on to 
		your naked body and said to 
		me... drink this... 
		
	camera moves in tighter on her face as she chats with a 
	customer about the weather.
	
				ben
		... if you spread your legs 
		and had bourbon dripping from 
		your breasts and you vagina 
		and said drink here... then i 
		could fall in love with you, 
		because then i would have a 
		purpose, to clean you up, and 
		that would prove that i'm 
		worth something. id lick you 
		clean so you could go away 
		and fuck someone else.
		
					bank girl
		next!
	
	ben takes a moment to come out of his reverie. he smiles and 
	comes to the counter, completely in control of himself.
	
				ben
		i'm back, i've got my 
		check... and baby... i'm ready 
		to sign.
	
	he flips the check over, makes sure she is watching and signs 
	with a flourish.
	
				ben
		there... steady as a fucking 
		rock, excuse my french.
				(serious)
		wanna have dinner with me?
	
	she counts the money out and glares at him as she hands it 
	over.
	
				bank girl
		i'm glad you're feeling 
		better. do you need a 
		validation?
	
	ben looks at her and smiles.
