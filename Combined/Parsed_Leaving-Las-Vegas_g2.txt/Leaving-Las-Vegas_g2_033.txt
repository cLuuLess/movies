	32 ext. kerbside - night
	
	the girl looks up and down the street and then walks over to 
	the car and bends down to the window.
	
				hispanic girl
		you wanna date? you wanna 
		date me?
	
	the girl's eyes shift constantly from ben to the street and 
	then back again.
	
				ben
			(cut to the chase)
		i'll give you a hundred 
		dollars for a straight forty-
		five minutes. you get the 
		room.
		
	ben shows her the money. 
	
				hispanic girl
			(trying to take him)
		the room is twenty. you pay 
		for it.
	
	ben laughs.
	
				ben
		ok... but only because i think 
		that the concept of surrender 
		fits in with the big picture 
		right now. how about over 
		there?
	
	he gives her a twenty and indicates a motel across the 
	street. she sets off and he gets out of the car. as he does, 
	a wave of nausea hits him. he shakes his head violently and 
	then lurches across the street, causing two cars to hit their 
	brakes. the camera follows him into the dark parking lot of 
	the motel, where the hispanic girl is waiting.
	
				ben
			(slurring badly)
		i canremember... if 
		mywifeleffme... or illeff 
		her... bufuckittanyway... 
	
	the girl laughs at ben and says something in spanish.
	
	slowly the picture gets darker, until all that can be seen is 
	the headlights from the passing cars on sunset... and then...
