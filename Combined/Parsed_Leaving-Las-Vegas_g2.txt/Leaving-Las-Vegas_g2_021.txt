	20 int. sera's bedroom. las vegas - day
	
	sera wakes up in bed next to yuri. (the camera is high above 
	the bed looking down.) she is completely drenched in sweat. a 
	thin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and 
		falls across their bodies. other than that, the room is in 
	darkness. to get out of bed she would have to climb over him. 
	she lies still. yuri speaks without opening his eyes... 
	
				yuri
		i missed you, sera. you have 
		been lonely?
	
	sera blinks and turns her head towards him.
	
				sera
		i'm older now, yuri.
	
	he puts his hand between her legs, over the sheets and grasps 
	her there.
	
				yuri
		you have been lonely?
	
				sera
			(tensing a little)
		i've been all right.
	
				yuri
		i will keep you safe. we are 
		both older.
	
	he climbs on to her and mounts her. familiarity.
	
				yuri
		you have been lonely?
	
				sera
			(flat voice)
		i am lonely, yuri.
	
	he begins thrusting into her.
	
				yuri
		yes... so am i.
	
	camera move slowly into a tight portrait of sear.
	
				sera
			(voice-over)
		i had a new dress... we were 
		at the fair, daddy bought me 
		an ice-cream and i spilt it 
		on my dress...
