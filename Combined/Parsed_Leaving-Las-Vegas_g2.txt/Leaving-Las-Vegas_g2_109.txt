	108 ext. pool-side - day
	
	... to the side of the pool, where sera is sunbathing. he 
	lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling 
	a drop of the drinks, which he puts down on to a glass-topped 
	table. he is pretty loaded. sera turns over and moves out of 
	his shadow.
	
				sera
		i've missed the best sun. why 
		did you have to pawn your 
		watch?
		
				ben
		i didn't know i'd ever need 
		it again.
	
	sera gets up, takes a drink and then walks to the diving 
	board. as she takes a position at the end, she pulls the 
	bathing suit out from her bottom, does a very natural dive 
	into the pool, swims a length under water and then comes out 
	near ben, pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends 
	down and kisses ben for a long time. ben responds and kisses 
	back. there is no one else around the pool.
	
	the kiss becomes heated and urgent and sera sits on ben, 
	making him wet from her. he pushes the top of her suit down 
	and kisses her breasts. she picks up the glass and drinks, 
	letting the alcohol spill from her mouth, over her breasts. 
	ben drinks from her.
	
					ben
		take this off.
	
	he tries to pull her swimsuit down.
	
				sera
		maybe we should go inside. 
		come on.
	
	she stands up, covering herself. ben stands up, laughing, 
	loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete. he falls 
	backwards, half on to the chair, which he breaks, and then on 
	to the glass table. the table goes over and it and the 
	glasses all shatter on the concrete. ben falls on the broken 
	glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms. glass 
	goes into the pool. blood mingles with the water on the 
	steaming cement.
	
				ben
		whoops.
	
	sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him. she 
	kneels and helps him up, trying to pullout the little bits of 
	glass sticking to him. ben stands unsteadily.
	
				ben
		i'll go and clean up. perhaps 
		you could take care of this. 
	
	he indicates the mess, then walks to their room. sera begins 
	carefully picking up the broken glass. the desk clerc appears 
	with a broom and a dustpan.
	
				desk-clerk
			(cheerfully)
		everybody ok?
	
				sera
		yes, fine. don't worry. we'll 
		pay for the chair, and i'll 
		clean all this up, the pool 
		too.
	
				desk-clerk
		don't worry.
	
	he begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan, cheerfully 
	ignoring sera.
	
				sera
		you seem prepared for 
		accidents.
	
				desk-clerk
			(still smiling)
		yeah... we get a lot of screw-
		ups here.
	
	he looks directly at sera.
	
				desk-clerk
		now, you two keep you loud 
		talk and your liquor to your 
		room. check out first thing 
		tomorrow and after that i 
		don't want to see either of 
		you here again. i don't need 
		you paying for the chair or 
		cutting your pretty hands on 
		the glass. let's leave it at 
		that.
		
	nodding firmly, he goes back to the mess, indicating that the 
	conversation is over.
	
				desk-clerk
		see ya in the morning.
	
	cut to:
