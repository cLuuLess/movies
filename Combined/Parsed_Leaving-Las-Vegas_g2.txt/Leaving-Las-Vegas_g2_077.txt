	76 int. yuri's room - night
	
	sera comes into the room, takes her purse out and counts out 
	seven hundred dollars.
	
				sera
		sorry, yuri... good 
		night... lots of tricks... i 
		think things are picking up.
		
	yuri sits on the bed. he looks unwell and disoriented. his 
	face is covered with a thin film of sweat. he seems to be 
	listening for something, because he stops her talking by 
	putting his fingers to his lips. he looks at her and then 
		beckons her to the bed. sera is nervous. as she walks to the 
	bed, she begins unbuttoning her blouse. yuri stops her with a 
	wave of his hand. sera is puzzled and frightened now. yuri 
	seems to be deranged.
	
				yuri
		have you told anyone that i'm 
		here?
	
				sera
		no.
	
	yuri suddenly hears something. he grabs sera's hand and takes 
	her to the wall. he presses her head to the wall.
	
				yuri
		do you here that?
	
	he looks at her.
	
				yuri
		they're talking about me.
	
	he pulls himself together.
	
				yuri
		go, sera.
			(whispers)
		go. stay at home. i will call 
		you tomorrow.
				sera
		yuri... are you... 
	
				yuri
			(patiently)
		sera... please go.
	
	he indicates the wall.
	
				yuri
		this is very important... and 
		i must listen. now go.
	
	they face each other for a moment and then yuri does an 
	almost comic gesture to tell her to go. he hustles her to the 
	door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her 
	blouse. he slams the door. 
	
				yuri
			(through the door)
		goodbye, sera. don't come 
		back here. i will not see you 
		again.
	
	sera stands there for a while, almost in shock, and then she 
		begins to walk. the camera follows her as she makes her way 
	down the endless corridor of doors. ahead of her, three men 
	are walking towards her, checking the door numbers as they 
	make their way. sera doesn't take them in. they pass and turn 
	a corner. we recognize them as the men from the black 
	town car.
	
	angle
	
	the men have stopped outside yuri's room. the camera pans and 
	we see sera down the other corridor getting into the 
	elevator.
	
	fade out:
