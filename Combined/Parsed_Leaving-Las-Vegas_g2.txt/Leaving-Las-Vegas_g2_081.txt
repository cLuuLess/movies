	80 int. restaurant - night
	
	ben and sera are eating. he plays with his food, eating very 
	little of it. finally he pushes it away and orders another 
	drink.
	
				sera
		i'm from the east. i went to 
		college, did an arts course. 
		i now live in vegas. i think 
		of it as home. i came here 
		deliberately to carve out a 
		life. i was in la before, but 
		i'll come back to that later.
			(pause)
		the tough times are behind me 
		now. i can deal with the bad 
		things that happen. there 
		will always be dark 
		characters. but my life is 
		good. it is as i would want 
		it to be. so, why are you a 
		drunk? 
	
				ben
		is that really what you want 
		to ask me? 
	
				sera
		yes.
	
				ben
			(worried)
		well, then i guess this is 
		our first date... or our last. 
		until now, i wasn't sure it 
		was either.
		 
				sera
		very clever.
	
		sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on 
	this.
	
				sera
		first. it's our first. i'm 
		just concerned. so... why are 
		you killing yourself?
	
	
				ben
		interesting choice of words. 
		i don't remember. i just know 
		that i want to.
		
				sera
		want to kill yourself? are 
		you saying  that you're 
		drinking as a way to kill 
		yourself?
	
	and she leans across the table to be close to him, listening 
	intently. ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off. 
	
				ben
		or killing myself as a way to 
		drink.
	
	sera continues to stare at him, wanting to know the real 
	answer. he takes a slug from his drink. she sits back.
	
				ben
		we'll talk about it some 
		other time maybe. ok?
	
	sera relaxes and continues with her food. we hear her 
	thoughts for a moment.
	
				sera (v.o)
		it wasn't so important to me. 
		i mean, he never asked me why 
		i was a hooker, sand that was 
		impressive. i really liked 
		him. so i decided to just 
		play my part. i mean... it's 
		good to help someone once in 
		a while., it's a bonus to 
		being alive, and that was my 
		plan... to stay alive. i 
		suddenly came to a decision.
	
				ben
		what are you thinking? are 
		you angry with me?
		 
				sera
				(decides something)
		ben, why don't you stay at my 
		place tonight? i mean... look, 
		you're so drunk. i like you. 
		i trust you.
	
				ben
		that's astonishing. sera, 
		look... 
	
				sera
		i hate to think of you in 
		that cheesy motel. i mean... 
	
	and she folds her arms and grins at him.
	
				sera
		let's face it, what the fuck 
		are you doing in las vegas?
	
				ben
			(overwhelmed by her)
		i'm going to move to a smart 
		hotel, tomorrow if it'll make 
		you feel better.
			(looks at her)
		let's talk about tomorrow. 
		wanna do something?
	
				sera
			(warmly)
		sure... tonight. then please 
		stay at my place.
	
				ben
		sera... you know i'm not much 
		good in the sack.
	
				sera
		it's not about sex, ben. i'll 
		make you up a bed on the 
		sofa. do it for me. we can 
		talk till late and then sleep 
		till late. as you know, i am 
		my own boss.
		
	ben laughs loud, the most animated we've seen him, and his 
	laugh as infectious, and sera join in. other diners turn to 
	stare at them. they seem like a couple.
