	87 int. sera's house - day
	
				sera
		ben?
	
				ben
		sorry.
	
	he shakes his head.
	
				ben
		i was miles away.
	
	he sees the parcels.
	
				ben
		ah... more gifts. i have to 
		sit down for this.
	
	he strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa. she 
	follows.
	
				ben
		sera, i love that 
			name... s.e.r.a. before we 
		proceed onwards, there is 
		something i need to say. ok?
		
				sera
		ok.
	
				ben
		i've come this far... here i 
		am, in your house. i want you 
		to let me pay the rent for 
		this month. all right?
		
	and he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen 
	until this matter is resolved.
	
				sera
		why?
	
				ben
		because... it's better for me 
		that way. ok?
	
				sera
		well... ok... 
	
	she is uncomfortable.
	
	they sit in silence for a while.
	
				ben
		sera... i hope that you 
		understand how i feel about 
		this. first of all, you're 
		welcome to my money. we can 
		buy a couple of cases of 
		liquor and you can have the 
		rest. but i don't think 
		you're talking to me right 
		now about money.
		
				sera
			(smiling)
		no?
	
				ben
		no. i think you're talking 
		about you. i'll tell you 
		right now that i'm in love 
		with you... but, be that as it 
		may, i'm not here to force my 
		twisted life into your soul.
		
				sera
		i know that... 
		
				ben
		... and i'm not here to demand 
		your attention to the point 
		where it changes your life. 
		we know i'm a drunk... but 
		that seems to be all right 
		with you. and i know that 
		you're a hooker. i hope you 
		understand that i'm a person 
		who is totally at ease with 
		this... which is not to say 
		that i'm indifferent or that 
		i don't care... i do... it 
		simply means that i trust and 
		accept your judgement. what 
		i'm saying is... that i hope 
		you understand that i 
		understand.
		
				sera
		thanks, i do understand. i 
		was worried about how that 
		would be... but now i'm not. 
		and you should know that 
		included with the rent here 
		is a complimentary blow job.
		
				ben
		ah, yes... i suppose sooner or 
		later we ought to fuck.
	
				sera
		whatever that means. open 
		your presents.
	
	she hands him the larger of the two parcels.
	
				sera
		open this one first.
	
	ben awkwardly unwraps the present, a large, colorful shirt. a 
	genuine smile comes on to his face.
	
				ben
		very nice.
	
	he holds the shirt against himself.
	
				ben
		this should work very nicely 
		with my suit, which, by the 
		way, is the only item of 
		clothing i brought over from 
		the motel with me.
			
	sera raise an eyebrow.
	
				sera
		right... the suitcase was 
		clinking. so what did you do 
		with your clothes?
		
				ben
			(laughing)
		i threw them into the 
		garbage., which was perhaps 
		immoral, but i wanted to come 
		to you clean, so to speak. i 
		thought we could go shopping 
		and pick up a pair of jeans 
		and forty-five pairs of 
		underwear and just throw them 
		out each day.
		
				sera
			(smiling)
		nice talk, ben. keep 
		drinking. in between the 
		hundred and one proof breath 
		and the occasional drool, 
		some interesting words fall 
		from your mouth.
		
	she hands him the last present.
	
				sera
		now, try this one.
	
	ben unwraps the smallest gift. it is a silver hip flask. he 
	is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek.
	 
				ben
		well... looks like i'm with 
		the right girl.
		
	he turns it in his hands.
	
				ben
		i must say that i'm very 
		impressed that you would buy 
		this for me. i know you 
		wouldn't do this without 
		thinking about it. 
		funny... you did just what i 
		would have done.
		
	ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit. it is 
	fine. he walks to the door.
	
					ben
		i'm going to fill it right 
		now.
	
				sera
		do you want to go gambling 
		tonight? we could go out and 
		play for a few hours.
		
	ben comes back into the room, takes the flask out of his suit 
	pocket and has a drink.
	
				ben
		i hadn't planned to 
		gamble... but if you would 
		keep the bulk of my money 
		here, then i could safely 
		blow a couple of hundred 
		bucks.
		
	he takes out all of his money, peels off a few hundreds and 
	then gives her the rest.
	
				ben
		giving you money makes me 
		want to come.
	
				sera
		then come.
			(pause)
		i'm going to change. watch 
		tv. i'll be half an hour.
	
	and she leaves. there is a slight edge to her voice and ben 
	is not sure if he offended her or not. he watches through the 
	small angle of the door as she changes.
	
				sera
		i am planning to go out and 
		do some work.
	
				ben
		when?
	
				sera
		tomorrow night as a matter of 
		fact.
