	125 ext. the strip - night
	
	three college boys with beer bottles walk the the strip. they 
	are all wearing the same numbered jersey. nice middle-class 
	boys looking for an adventure. they see sera and go into a 
	huddle before walking over to her.
	
				tallest college boy
		how much will it cost us to 
		fuck you?
	
	the other two college boys titter. sera starts to walk away 
	and then hesitates.
	
				sera
		sorry, guys, but i don't know 
		what you mean. anyway, i 
		never date more than one guy 
		at a time.
	
				smallest college boy
		come on... we got money... show 
		her the money.
	
	the other college boy gets out his wallet and opens it to 
	show her. sera hesitates, not somehow comfortable with the 
	situation, then goes ahead.
	
				sera
		how much of that money did 
		you guys want to spend?
	
				tallest college boy
		how much you want? how about 
		two hundred for an hour?
	
				sera
			(becoming annoyed with them)
		don't your friends talk?
			(no answer)
		try three-hundred for a half 
		hour.
	
				other college boy
			(nervous)
		three hundred for the hour.
	
				sera
		ok... three... and we'll see 
		how it goes. where are you 
		staying?
	
					tallest college boy
		the yukon, room twenty-four.
	
				sera
		i'll see you there in fifteen 
		minutes. you can pay me then. 
		why don't you all take a 
		shower while you're waiting.
		
				other college boy
		a shower? in fifteen minutes?
	
				sera
		look... i'll only need one of 
		you at a time. right? 
		understood? so... the other 
		two can shower while i'm 
		there. ok?
		
	they walk off in a huddle, giggling - three small boys.
