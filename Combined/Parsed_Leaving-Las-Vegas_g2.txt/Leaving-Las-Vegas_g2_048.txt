	47 ext. ben's yard - night
	
	ben pours lighter fluid on to a pile of photographs and then 
	throws a match on to it. it bursts into flames. he throws 
	more stuff on and the fire blazes. a curious neighbor watches 
	from a safe distance, not wanting too get involved.
	
	angle on the fire 
	
	a watercolor, a poem to his wife, photograph of him and his 
	wife, a polaroid of a naked woman, his medical records, his 
	birth and marriage certificates, divorce papers, strips of 
	photographs from booths, postcards from hawaii. two small 
	children (his?). 
	
	angle on ben
	
	now the flames are high and ben has to stand back as he 
	throws things on to the fire ... his camera, an engraved box, 
	his wife's 'left behind' clothing , a clock...
