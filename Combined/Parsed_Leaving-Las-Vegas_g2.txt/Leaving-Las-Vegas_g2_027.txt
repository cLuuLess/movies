	26 int. ben's bar. la - night
	
	ben is sitting at the bar. he drinks a large glass of 
	something very quickly and then immediately orders another.
	
	he drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes 
	it and then orders another. he looks around the bar and sees 
	a woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive. 
	she looks and sees ben, and he smiles at her. she smiles 
	right back. ben talks across the bar. 
	
				ben
			(charming)
		good evening.
	
				pretty woman
			(pleased)
		hi.
	
				ben
		i'm benjamin...ben.
	
				pretty woman
		i'm teri.
	
	ben walks over to where she is. she is pleased that this 
	good-looking man has come over to make a play. she makes a 
	noise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty.
	
				ben
		i'll get you another 
		one... and me too. mind if i 
		join you?
	
	she watches him walk to the bar. he gets the drink and walks 
	back to her. he sets the drinks down on the table and sits 
	down. as he does so, his face gets close to hers and she 
	smells the booze on him.
	
				pretty woman
		wow... been drinking all day?
	
				ben
		but of course.
	
	she looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. she 
	is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this 
	much is clear to ben.
	
				ben
		why don't we finish these and 
		go to my apartment on the 
		beach?
	
	she doesn't respond.
	
				ben
		we can watch a movie and i'll 
		mix you up a gooey blender 
		drink.
		
	ben winces at his own words. he shakes his head.
	
				pretty woman
		i have to get up pretty early 
		tomorrow. i'll just finish 
		this and go. thanks anyway.
		
	they drink in silence for a while. ben takes a deep breath.0
	
				ben
			(pathetic)
		i really wish that you'd come 
		home with me. you're so cute 
		and i'm really good in 
		bed... believe me... you smell 
		good too... 
	
	he stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass.
	
				ben
		no, ok.
	
	ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the 
	bar. it's a strange thing with drunks like ben... when they're 
	up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all 
	falls apart. she starts to speak but then doesn't. a look of 
	great sadness comes over her.
	 
				pretty woman
		i have to go now. thanks 
		anyway.
	
	she stands to go.
	
				pretty woman
		maybe you shouldn't drink so 
		much.
	
	she walks to the door and ben turns to the bar, watched by he 
	barman, who is a little concerned.
	
				ben
			(to himself)
		maybe i shouldn't breathe so 
		much, teri. ha... ha.
	
				barman
			(sever voice)
		time to go, buddy... we're 
		closing up.
	
	ben gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much 
	that he cannot extract any bills. he is very embarrassed and 
	tries again, but to no avail.
		
				ben
		would you... ?
	
	the barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the 
	wallet and takes some money.
