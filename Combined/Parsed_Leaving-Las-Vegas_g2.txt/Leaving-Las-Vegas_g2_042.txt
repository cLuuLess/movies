	41 int. ben's bar. la. - morning
	
	ben seated at the bar, a pile of bills in front of him. the 
	barman sets down a vodka, picks up the empty glass and takes 
	some bills, shaking his head in disapproval. the tv is on, 
	some game show as before, and ben watches carefully, looking 
	for a sign from the girl, but the show proceeds in its 
	'normal' fashion. the only difference is that the hostess is 
	played by the girl in the bank. ben grabs the barman's 
	attention.
	
				ben
		i think, when i'm done with 
		this, i'll have gin and 
		tonic... bombay gin and tonic.
		
	the barman loses it
	
				barman
			(angry)
		you should be having coffee. 
		do you know what time it is? 
		you're a young man.
			(calmer)
		it's none of my business, but 
		if you could see what i see, 
		you wouldn't do this to 
		yourself.
	
	ben is taken aback by the emotion in his voice. in his mind, 
	cynicism and the desire to cry fight it out. he holds the 
	emotion back, and looks down at the bar.
	
				ben
		i understand what you're 
		saying... i appreciate your 
		concern. its not my intention 
		to make you uncomfortable. 
		please... serve me today and i 
		will never come in here 
		again.
			(cheerful)
		if i do, you can eighty-six 
		me.
	
				barman
		sure, sure, i can eighty-six 
		you now if i want to. stop 
		fucking with me. i don't give 
		a fuck what you do.
	
	he picks up a bottle of gin, fills a glass, slams it on the 
	counter in front of ben and knocks twice with his knuckles on 
	the bar.
	
				barman
	on the house, son.

	ben looks at the tv for a sign. none is forthcoming.
