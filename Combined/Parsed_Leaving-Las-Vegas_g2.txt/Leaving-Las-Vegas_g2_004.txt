	4 int. penthouse suite of hotel - night
	
	a view of night-time las vegas through a window. traffic up 
	and down the strip; bright, gaudy neon flashing and winking.
	we hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls 
	focus and we see reflected in the glass...
	
	...a group of people.
	
	on the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and 
	sandwiches. the tv is on at a sports channel and two 
	boxers pound the shit out of each other.
