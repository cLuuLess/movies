	121 int. sera's house - later that night
	
	sera lets herself in, looks around and opens the bedroom 
	door. 
	
	angle:
	
	in one fluid movement the naked blonde gets off the semi-
	conscious ben, pulls her dress over her head and walks past 
	sera. moments later we hear the front door slam. ben comes to 
	and looks at sera. he is more or less unaware of what has 
	just happened. 
	
				ben
		hello... 
	
	angle on sera
		
	her eyes are wet.
	
				sera	
		there are limits.
	
				ben
			(remembering)
		yes... i guess i knew that.
	
	ben gets out of the bed. he picks up the bottle on the 
	bedside table and stands.
	
				ben
		perhaps i could crash on the 
		couch for a few hours... and 
		then i'll leave.
	
	he walks out of the room and closes his the door. camera 
	moves in on sera. she covers her face with her hands. she 
	drops her purse and slides down the wall to the floor, 
	weeping quietly.
	
				sera (v.o)
		i heard the door slam a 
		couple of hours later and he 
		was gone.
	
	fade out:
