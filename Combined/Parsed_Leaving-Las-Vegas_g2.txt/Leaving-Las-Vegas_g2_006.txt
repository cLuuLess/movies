	6 int. penthouse - night
	
	a bottle of scotch is almost empty. the man talking is yuri. 
	he is russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, 
	a big man wearing a blue silk suit. his thick black hair 
	is greased and combed back. he wears a lot of jewelry, 
	all gold. rings, a bracelet and a rolex. two men in 
	business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late 
	thirties listen to him.
	
				yuri
		...but please, my friends, 	
		call me yuri. it is my 	
		american name... i picked it 	
		myself.
	
	the three people laugh. there is a hint of contempt in 
	the way that they speak to yuri.
	
				first businessman
		where are you from, yuri? i 	
		mean, you sure don't talk 	
		like you're from this neck of 
		the woods. 
	
	yuri smiles at them.
	
				yuri
			(silky voice)
		no... you are right, my 	
		friend. how very observant 	
		you are. i am from latvia.
		
				weird woman
		tough place.
	
				yuri
		yes, i hear this too. but i 	
		am not a tough man. i am a 	
		simple man who is here to 	
		learn from my new american 	
		friends.
	
	the door opens and sera comes in. everybody stares at her.
	
				weird woman
			(turned on)
		is this your friend, yuri?
		
				yuri
		ah, yes... sera.
	
	the second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from 
	his inside pocket.
	
				yuri(cont'd)
		sera is my gift to you, my 	
		friends from new york city. 	
		you may do with her as you 	
		wish in this beautiful room, 	
		which is also my gift for the 
		night to my friends. you will 
		find her a very willing girl, 
		for all of you...just as we 	
		arranged.
	
	yuri smiles again as the second businessman hands him the 
	envelope. the rest of them just stare at sera, aroused by the 
	idea of her.
		
			second businessman
		of course, yuri. i think 	
		you'll find this just as we 	
		discussed.
		
	yuri gets up.
	
				yuri
		so, my friends... i have other 
		business to attend. enjoy.
		
		
	he heads for the door, passing sera. she holds out his arm as 
	he passes.
	
				sera
			(whispering)
		yuri... please! can i talk to 	
		you for a moment.
		
		
	still smiling, he takes sera's arm and leads her into the 
	bedroom.
	
	
				yuri
		my friends... excuse me for 	
		just one moment.
