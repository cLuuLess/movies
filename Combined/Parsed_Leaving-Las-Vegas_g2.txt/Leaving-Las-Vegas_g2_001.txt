	1 int. smart bar in beverly hills - night
	
		
	it is the kind of bar where the well-to-do folks of la go 
	to pick up - or be picked up. lesser-known actors, agents 
	and executives of all ages.
	
	into this bar comes ben.
	
	ben is in his thirties. he is wearing an armani suit 
	that could use a visit to the dry-cleaner's. he hasn't 
	shaved in the last twenty-four hours (but neither has 
	any of the actors in the bar). he is a good-looking man 
	but is clearly in trouble of some kind. although still 
	in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the 
	following scene that he is much the worse for wear with 
	drink. he looks around the room until he sees someone he
	recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples
	are seated. the men are young execs, the girls, both blonde 
	and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. 
	the camera follows ben over to the table. one of the execs
	looks up as ben gets close. he recognizes him but delays 
	his recognition until the last moment in the hope that ben 
	is not looking at him.

		peter
		
				peter
		ben... how are you, man?
	
	they shake hands. ben is not invited to take a seat and 
	peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him 
	to the table.
	
	ben sanderson, marc nussbaum, sheila, debbie.
	
	
				marc
		nice to meet you. i think i 	
		spoke to you on the phone a 	
		couple of years ago. weren't 	
		you both at mgm with laddie?
	
				ben
		that's right. are you still
		at icm?
	
				marc
		no, i'm at tri-star now.
	
				ben
		that's great. say hello to 	
		mike for me. that's a 	
		beautiful dress, debbie, and 	
		those are fabulous earrings, 	
		sheila.
	
	there is an awkward silence. ben does not make a move and 
	is not invited to join them. the girls smile.
	 
				marc
		i gotta tell you, i'm a big 	
		fan of your writing. i loved 	
		bay of pigs.
	
				ben
		thanks a lot. i didn't 	
		actually write it, i just got 
		the credit. i was fired.
			(to peter)
		can i talk to you for a 	
		moment?
	
	peter gets up and he and ben walk to the door together. 
	peter speaks very quietly.
	
				peter
		listen, ben, i can't help you 
		any more. do you understand?
	
				ben
			this is the last time. 	
		promise. i just need some 	
		cash tonight. i lost my 	
		credit cards. the money'll be 
		on your desk first thing 	
		tomorrow morning, scout's 	
		honor. how's the new one 	
		coming along? i here you got 	
		richard gere.
	
	the two men look at each other for a while. peter's 
	friends are looking at them, as are other people in 
	the room. peter takes out his wallet and extracts some 
	notes.
	
				peter
		this is all i have in cash. 	
		please don't drink it here.
	
				ben
		yes, that's fine. i'll	
		messenger it over to you 	
		tomorrow.
	
				peter
		i don't want it. ben... i
		think it would be best if you 
		didn't contact me again.
	
	and he turns and walks away, back to his table.
