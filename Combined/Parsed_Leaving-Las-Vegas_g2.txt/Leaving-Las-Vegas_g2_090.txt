	90 int. sera's house - night
	
	ben wakes up on the sofa, fully dressed. a night-light gives 
	a soft glow. he rolls off the sofa, landing on all fours on 
	the floor. he crawls to the kitchen , opens the fridge door 
	and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice. with 
	difficulty he gets to his feet, finds a glass and pour s a 
	drink. he swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just 
	in case he has to vomit.
