	58 ext. the strip - night
	
	ben driving. he sees sera and follows her, then drives up on 
	the sidewalk. she sees him.
	
				ben
		hello!
	
				sera 
		hello.
	
				ben
		are you working?
	
				sera
			(tough)
		working? what do you mean, 
		working? i'm walking.
	
	and she walks a few steps to prove it, stopping on the 
	passenger side of his car. they pause for a moment and ben is 
	confused. he is quite taken with her beauty, but this is not 
	going according to plan. he reaches into the car quickly and 
	picks an open can of bee, draining it before tossing the 
	empty back on to the rear seat.
	
				sera
		isn't it illegal to drink and 
		drive?
	
				ben
			(laughs)
		that's funny.
			(seriously)
		i wonder if you'll take two 
		hundred and fifty dollars to 
		fuck me?
		
	sera doesn't say anything.
	
				ben
		that is, if you'll come to my 
		room for an hour, i will give 
		you five hundred dollars.
	
				sera
		maybe you shouldn't stand in 
		the road like that. you're 
		pretty drunk.
	
	he bites his lips as he waits for her to respond.
	
				sera
			(softer)
		you're pretty drunk.
	
				ben
			(factual)
		not really. my room's not 
		far. the whole year inn. you 
		can drive with me if you 
		want... 
		
	she makes no response.
	
				ben
		... or we can walk... or i'll 
		give you cab fare.
		
	takes out his money.
	
				ben
		whatever you want.
	
	she touches the door handle.
	
				sera
		why don't you give me the 
		money when i'm in the car, 
		and i'll drive you.
		
	it takes a moment or two to register that she is saying yes. 
	he comes around the car to open the door for her.
	
				ben
		i'm ben.
	
	
	
	they shake hands.
	
				sera
			i'm sera.
	
	she gets in. ben gets in.
