	66 int. sera's house - dawn
	
	sera lets herself in. yuri is standing in the shadows. she 
	gets a fright when she sees him.
	
				yuri
		where have you been?
	
				sera
		it was a slow night. i went 
		to a hotel for a few drinks.
		
	yuri holds out his hand for her bag. she gives it to him. he 
	finds the money and counts it.
	
				yuri
		a full night on the street 
		and this is all?
	
				sera
		like i said... it was a slow 
		night... i'm sorry. it was 
		hard to score.
	
	yuri slaps her.
	
				sera
		don't hit me.
	
				yuri
		what do you think... you are 
		sixteen years old on 
		hollywood boulevard?
		
	yuri talks in russian, becoming angrier, and slaps her again. 
	he spits on the floor.
	
	sera falls against the kitchen table and picks up a lethal-
	looking knife. yuri stops. 
	
				sera
		maybe nobody wants to fuck a 
		chick with a cut on her 
		cheek.
		
	she throws the knife to yuri, who catches it. she bends over 
	the table and pulls up her skirt.
	
				sera
		there, go ahead!
	
	she mimics him.
	
	a shower of russian comes out of yuri, but he doesn't touch 
	her. he tries to regain his dignity by putting on a coat.
	
				yuri
		i could kill you. you know 
		that.
	
	he goes to the door.
	
				yuri
		work, tonight, bring me 
		money, no matter the hour.
	
	and he exits. sera is still on the table.
	
				sera
		i will yuri. i will.
	
		cut to:
