	70 int. main bar, hotel - night
	
	a lounge singer belts out a fair rendition of a tony orlando 
	number. sera sits at the bar, an empty seat on either side of 
	her. she watches a younger hooker in the final moments of 
	pulling a dangerous-looking man. the girl is aware of sera 
	without even looking at her. the guy she is with looks around 
	and sees sera. the girl shoots an icy look. a man sits next 
	to sera: a conventioneer.
	
				conventioneer
		about ready for another 
		drink?
	
				sera
		yes, that would be great. are 
		you her for the convention?
	
				conventioneer
		do i look that obvious? my 
		name's paul.
	
	they shake hands.
	
				sera
		no, of course not, just a 
		wild guess. i'm sera and 
		that's a margarita.
	
		the barman is already pouring. the young hooker leaves with 
	her dangerous guy. she pauses long enough to give sera a 
	nasty smile. the conventioneer pays for the drink and is a 
	little lost for words. sera tries to help.
	
				sera
		so... are you alone, or are 
		you just using me to make 
		someone else jealous?
	 
				conventioneer
			(laughs nervously)
		alone. alone. i'm here alone.
	
				sera
			(friendly)
		where are you staying?
	
				conventioneer
			(suspicious)
		right here at the hotel. why?
	
				sera
			(moving a little closer)
		well... i thought you might be 
		looking for a date.
	
				conventioneer
			(shocked)
		a date. what, are you a 
		hooker?
			(voice getting louder)
		what do you mean a date?
			(and louder)
		i've got a wife back home. i 
		just came over to talk for a 
		few minutes.
		
				sera
			(quietly)
		i'm sorry, i guess i 
		misunderstood.
	
	she looks around.
	
				sera
		please don't raise your 
		voice. i won't bother you 
		about it again.
		
				conventioneer
			(calmer)
		sorry. look... you seem like a 
		nice girl. i'm just sick of 
		everyone in this town trying 
			to get my money.
	
	he gets up.
	
				conventioneer
		here, have another drink. i 
		gotta go.
	
	he leaves. sera is uncomfortable. people are watching her, 
	aware that something has been going on. the barman comes over 
	to where sera is sitting.
	
				barman
		maybe you should give it a 
		miss for this evening.
	
	he walks away. sera finishes her drink and leaves.
