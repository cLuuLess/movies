	78 int. sera's house - night
	
	sera is finishing in the shower and ben is sitting at the 
	kitchen table. he gets up and walks around the house, trying 
	to get a sense of her. the furniture is very plain and there 
	is spartan quality about the hose. he looks with interest at 
	the bookshelf, which has a good selection of literature. 
	
				ben
			(to himself)
		this is the home of an angel.
	
				sera (off-screen)
		you ok out there?
	
				ben
		yes. take your time. i'm 
		fine.
	
	he pours himself another drink.
	
				sera (off-screen)
		pour yourself another drink.
	
	he sots down and she comes in, toweling her hair.
	
				sera
		you ok?
	
				ben
		of course. wow... you look 
		extremely beautiful.
	
				sera
		thank you. what time is it?
	
				ben
		don't know. my watch went the 
		way of the car.
	
	he holds up his empty wrist for her to see. then looks up and 
	sees her watching him.
	
				ben
		i'm rambling. i really like 
		you. you make me want to 
		talk... i don't know what time 
		it is.
	
				sera
		i like hearing you talk.
			(businesslike)
		if you feel up to a short 
		walk, there's a place to eat 
		around the corner. all the 
		food in vegas is terrible so 
		the place doesn't really 
		matter. how does that sound 
		to you?
	
				ben
		do they have drinks?
