	86 ext. sera's house - day
	
	sera's neighbors, a husband and wife, are standing outside 
	her house. they stop her. they are also her landlord.
	
				husband
		we didn't know whether to 
		call the police or not.
	
	and they indicate the sleeping figure of ben, in the doorway, 
	clutching a bottle of bourbon, using hi suitcase as a pillow.
	
					wife
		he's been there for about 
		half an hour. my husband 
		thought he'd seen you two 
		together, but i thought it 
		best to wait until you got 
		home.
		
				sera
		yes, he's my friend. i guess 
		he just had a little too much 
		to drink.
			(smiling uncomfortably)
		i'll help him inside.
			(puts down her packages)
		thanks for the concern. sorry 
		to trouble you.
	
				husband
			(gallantly)
		well, call me if there's 
		anything i can do.
		
	they go to their own house. sera opens the front door, kneels 
	down next to ben and shakes him gently.
	
				sera
		can you wake up?
	
	ben opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant, cheerful 
	expression.
	
				ben
		hi!
	
				sera
		why don't you go in and sit 
		down. i have some gifts for 
		you.
	
				ben
		right... ok... 
	
	ben stands and almost loses his balance. he picks up his 
	suitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well, but 
	she stop him.
	
				sera
		don't worry... i got'em.
	
	ben staggers in with his case. as sera enters, she looks 
	around and sees husband and wife at the window, still 
	watching.
	
				ben (off-screen)
			want a drink? great nap. 
		wanna go out tonight?
	
				sera
		seriously, ben... i need to 
		keep pretty low-key around 
		here. maybe next time you 
		could nap this side of the 
		door. that was the landlord.
		
				ben
		of course.
	
	she reaches into her purse.
	
				sera
		gift number one.
	
	and she gives him a newly cut key. he takes it and tries it 
	in the lock, then drops it into his pocket.
	
				ben
		i used to carry a lot of 
		keys, but one by one they all 
		fell victim to the great 
		condensation. now i have just 
		this one... which is... 
		
	and he tails off and stares at the floor. she waits for him 
	to continue and then comes to him and touches him on the arm.
