	int. middle car - night

	spidey's face appears in the window upside down.

				spider-man
		hello, everybody...

	he slides the window down and flips inside. he walks
	through the parting passengers to the building wall. he
	feels it.

				spider-man
		okay, everyone, stand back and stay cool.

	he hurls himself at the fused glass portion and bounces
	back onto the floor. he rolls over, flexing his shoulder.

				woman
			(whining)
		is that the real spider-man?

	spidey does a triple flip to his feet. he reaches up for
	the overhead railing and pulls it down easily. oohs and
	aahs. spider-man points it at the glass and hefts it.

				spider-man
		somebody wanna give me a hand with this?

	first the woman, and then all of them, take up positions
	on the battering ram.

				spider-man
		on three. one... two... three!

	they ram the glass and it shatters.
