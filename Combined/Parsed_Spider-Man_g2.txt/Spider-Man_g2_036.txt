	ext. brick building - night

	peter's cheek is pressed against the brick. he opens his
	eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the
	building like a spider. and he's three stories up!
	he looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him!
	and the ambulance which he jumped over is driving away.
	he tries a downward step, but a brick dislodges and
	crashes to the sidewalk. he takes an upward step. and
	then another.

	tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he
	"crawls" to the roof of the building. at the top he
	gropes for a railing and slips. he dangles eight stories
	above the street. then, with a grunt, he vaults to the
	roof one-handed.
