	int. control room - night

	red power throttle is at 95% power!
	spider-man and roz enter, shielding their eyes from the
	glare. the countdown clock reads, "00:08:18".

				ock
			(looking back, madly)
		aha! you never included the conjunction
		in your calculations, did you?! rosomorf!

				roz
		damn the calculations! my god, otto, you
		have to hear me! the world we know will
		collapse! everything we have devoted our
		lives to... all the patterns, all the
		harmonies... everything will be destroyed.

				ock
		a new world waits! rosomorf! it is my
		destiny!!!

				roz
		it is cosmic suicide! you have no right!

	roz flings himself through the melted window into the
	experimental chamber. he grabs for the "bullet" but the
	waldos grab him and throw him back. roz staggers
	backward... into the arms of spider-man.

				roz
		you have to stop him... spider-man you
		have to stop him.

				spider-man
		i'm afraid we're too late.

	spider-man attacks ock, trying to push him away from the
	throttle. ock pushes spider-man away from him so strongly
	that spider-man is knocked down. ock nudges the power
	throttle forward and the whine increases to an ear
	shattering pitch. the countdown clock reads, "00:06:48".
	we are at 96% power!
