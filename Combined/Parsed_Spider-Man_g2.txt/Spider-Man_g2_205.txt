	int. control room - night

	trying to leave it, liz and spidey are confronted with a
	nightmare. the room is tilted at a 45% angle. pipes are
	bursting. spidey helps liz through the obstacles. debris
	rains down. they come face to face with a diagonal maze
	of pipes.

				spider-man
		maybe there's another way...

	a huge crack opens above them.

				liz
		it's breaking apart!

				spider-man
		alright, keep moving, a step at a time!

	they scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side,
	half the floor falls away! central park awaits, 8,000
	feet below.

				liz
		we have to go back.

				spider-man
		we can't go back.

	he looks across at the door. it is midway up a diagonal
	wall. he shoots a web up at the ceiling between
	themselves and the door. then he extends a hand to liz.

				liz
		forget it...

				spider-man
		okay, have it your way.

	he swings across and lands on the ledge of the door. then
	he swings the web back to her like a trapeze.
	liz catches the web and looks across at spider-man,
	furious.

				liz
			(shouting across)
		what am i supposed to do with this!

				spider-man
			(shouting back)
		go ahead. it's easier than it looks!
		we've got to try the fire escape.

	liz swings across like tarzan and spidey gathers her in on
	the ledge. she does a comic "phew" and the ledge buckles
	beneath them but holds. spider-man tries to open the
	door, but it's stuck.

				liz
		the door is stuck.

	spider-man bends his back to the task. it take all his
	strength, but with a comic aaaaargghh! he bends the door
	open.
