	int. ring - night

	the match continues in an increasingly spectacular
	choreography. crusher bellows at the screaming crowd.
	but there's a gleam in his eye. this is it!
	he charges. spidey, playing the cameras for all he's
	worth, leaps way, way up. but this time crusher stops
	dead in his tracks. spider-man comes back down into a
	forearm smash that sends him reeling into a corner.
	crusher does a flying pin. 300 pounds. womp! the air
	leaves spidey in a rush as crusher covers him, smothering
	him. the crowd goes wild.

				ref
		one...!

				reiss
		get up...! get up...!

				ref
		two...!

	not realizing his own strength and panicky about being
	squashed, spider-man throws crusher cole off him and up
	into the air. way up! reiss cheers... spider-man comes
	down and knocks crusher for the first time.

	crusher flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back!
	the hipster sees crusher coming at him and bolts from his
	seat. crusher lands on it, in between the two blondes who
	break into utter hysterics.

	spidey, surprised at his own strength, watches crusher
	land.

				spider-man
			(whispers to himself)
		wow...

				ref
		ladies and gentlemen, history is made
		today, we have here the first man to win
		a thousand dollars against the mighty
		crusher.

	the ref raises his hand in victory. the crowd boos and
	debris rains down. but some in the crowd cheer wildly,
	recognizing the new sensation.

	spider-man steps down from the right as reiss leads the
	cheers.

				peter

				reiss

	peter turns with reiss and comes face to face with crusher
	cole. two ominous beats.

		about what happened in there. really...

				crusher
