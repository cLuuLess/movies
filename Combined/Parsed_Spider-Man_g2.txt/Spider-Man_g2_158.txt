	ext. west side car chase montage - night

	with spidey jammed in between liz and flash, the mg chases
	the vette. since neither ock nor flash is any good at
	this, both cars quickly careen into poles, fences, hot dog
	cars and begin falling apart.

	on riverside drive the mg begins to lurch and steam. the
	vette looks eaten away. the george washington bridge
	looms ahead.

	the vette roars through the toll booth. they spot ock
	stuck in traffic.

				flash
		why is he going to new jersey, and who is
		it in that shitty red car...

				liz
		don't you recognize him... it's ock!

				spider-man
		new jersey has the largest toxic waste
		dump in the world.

				flash
		what does he want with toxic waste?

				spider-man
		he's looking for plutonium, my dear...
		the car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.

				flash
		sorry... can't do anything about this
		traffic.

	spider-man jumps out of the car.

				spider-man
		try to stay with me. i don't want to
		lose him!

	speeding along the bridge, ock sees no one. but high
	above, spidey swings from tower to tower after him. at
	the last tower, spidey leaps down onto a big truck. the
	vette weaves and spidey crosses to another big truck. for
	a moment he is caught between the two trucks, but he makes
	it across.

	the vette takes an exit. spidey leaps to the next sign.
	he aims his wrist gizmo and waits for the next car to take
	the exit, but none does. deflated, he drops to the
	ground. he looks up to see a sign on a cyclone fence. it
	says, "dump number 7 -- keep out -- radioactive material!"

				spider-man
		bingo.
