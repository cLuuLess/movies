	ext. the empire university - night

	the long scream segues to a police siren. a cop car pulls
	to a halt in front of the college. many nypd cars are
	already there, along with a nuclear regulatory van, some
	ambulances, a van from the environmental protection agency
	and two tv vans. roz runs across the lawn.

	police struggle to hold back the crowd of press, students
	and general gawkers.

	j. jameson pushes to the front of the mob in time to see
	two cops hustle a bugle photographer back into it.
	the man shakes his head. jameson throws down his cigar,
	stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. thorkel arrives to
	address the crowd.

				thorkel
			(through bull horn)
		there is no danger. please go back to
		your dorms. i repeat, there is no danger.

				jameson
			(approaches him)
		spill it out, professor! the public
		wants to know!

	the crowd closes on thorkel.

				thorkel
		who are you?

				jameson
		jameson, daily bugle, chief editor, now
		what really happened here?

				thorkel
		there will be a press announcement in the
		morning mr. jameson... now if you'll
		excuse me.

	this elicits a flood of ad libs: "i heard a terrible
	explosion?" "nuclear accidents?" "meltdown?" "genetic
	engineering?" "are you guys making mutants in there?"

				thorkel
		i have nothing to say... there will be an
		announcement. now, please go home...
		everybody... we must clear the grounds...

	in the back of the crowd are peter, harry, liz, flash and
	kim.

				flash
		you think they'll cancel classes?

				harry
		they must... the whole building must be
		contaminated with some kind of poisonous
		gas.

				peter
		how about nuclear contaminations?

				kim
		my god... lets beat it.
		but nobody moves.

				liz
			(more interested in other
			things)
		could anyone be in there, peter?

				peter
			(concerned)
		i don't know... maybe professor octavius.
		he usually works late...

				flash
		that nut, i bet it was all his doing...

				jameson
			(seeing peter)
		hey parker! peter parker!

	peter pushes forward.

				peter
		mr. jameson! what are you doing here?
		what's going on?

				jameson
		that's for them to know, and for you to
		find out.

				peter
		but sir, they wouldn't tell us. you
		heard thorkel... he said...

				jameson
		a press announcement tomorrow...! but we
		must know tonight parker. this is your
		university, right...

				peter
		yes, but...

				jameson
		you got your camera?

				peter
		sure, but i can't--

				jameson
		a hundred dollars says you can?

				peter
		yes sir!

				jameson
		get inside and get pictures, fifty bucks.

				peter
		you just said a hundred.

				jameson
		seventy, but i want blood and gore.

				peter
			(calling back)
		seeya guys.

	he dashes off. flash shakes his head in dismay at this
	guy.

				liz
		where is he going?

				jameson
		to make fifty bucks.
