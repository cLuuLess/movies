	int. jameson's office - day

	a photo assistant look on as jameson goes over peter's
	latest photos. they are his spider-man shots.

				peter
		doesn't he look amazing in that one?
		look, he's flying in the air!

				jameson
		i don't care if he flies to the moon.
		he's just another wrestler in a silly
		costume. look at this, parker, right off
		the wire. this is the guy who hit that
		armored truck this morning. they say he
		has metal arms... get me a picture of
		this character!

				peter
		metal arms?

				jameson
		four of them.

				peter
		ock...?!

				jameson
		the web faced weirdo... he is a joke in a
		halloween costume... don't make me laugh.

	he tears up peter's spidey photos.

				jameson
		now get out of here and don't come back
		without something i can use!

				peter
		yes sir...
			(stops, and turns back)

				jameson
		a mega baloney... a bug in blue tights...
		what next?

				peter
		the journal said he was a mega-smash on
		mtv...
