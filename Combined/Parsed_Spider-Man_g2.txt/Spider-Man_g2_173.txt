	int. computer lab - night

	the lights are off, but the computers are on. harry looks
	over liz's shoulder as she cracks through a code. her
	screen reads out, "connecticut. tech. fully op, line
	backlog, security max level." the last line is flashing.

				kim
		hey, this is easy.

	they all run from computer to computer.

				flash
		hey, harry i need help.

				harry
		coming!

	harry types in karnaky ltd and gets the same response. he
	looks at his digital wristwatch. "01:00:02" becomes
	"00:59:59" as we watch. then a warning buzzer!

				kim
		i got one! i got one!

				liz
		harry! get over here!

	harry hurries to kim's side and elbows her out of the
	chair. the screen is flashing "warning, security breach!"
	harry's hands fly over the keys. the kids gather around.
	line drawings of the cyclotron (progressing from large to
	small detail) appear one after the other. finally, a
	pipe. there is a circle around a joint. and the legend
	"h20".

				harry
		a goddamn water leak...

				flash
		hey, look at this. empire state
		university. this is our cyclotron,
		right?

				harry
			(serious)
		what does it say?

				flash
			(hits two keys)
		it says "no information on net."

				harry
		damn... we can't do it...

				kim
		you mean... we can't stop loony ock...

				harry
		i mean the world is in danger...

				flash
		we must find peter, he knows these
		computers better than all of us.

				harry
		yes, but where the hell is he?

				liz
			(mysteriously)
		i bet he is with spider-man...

	suddenly the lights dim. a heavy noise. an earth quake.
