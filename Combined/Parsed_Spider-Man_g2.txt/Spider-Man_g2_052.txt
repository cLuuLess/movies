	int. the ring - night

	crusher cole is doing a big flexing number and the crowd
	is going wild. there are mtv cameras and signs and
	banners proclaiming the "slammies" everywhere.

				ring announcer
		and now, a new challenger, for the
		thousand dollar fight, weighing in at one
		hundred and fifty pounds... from parts
		unknown! here is the amazing...
		mysterious... incredible superman...

				reiss
			(snorts from ringside,
			hating the name)
		no, not superman... spider-man...
		spider-man!!!

				ring announcer
		...spider-man!!!!!

	the crowd boos the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly
	through the ropes. rock music blares. twin redheads in
	red bikinis ring a bell.

	crusher cole and spider-man circle. cole is twice
	spidey's size. spidey spots a tv camera for the first
	time. he momentarily freezes. crusher sneers the crusher
	sneer. then he charges!

	with the agility of a spider, spidey leaps out of the way.
	crusher comes back at him. spidey leaps again, bigger!
	the acrobatics get more and more dramatic as crusher cole
	works himself up into a theatrical rage. taunts erupt
	from the crowd.

				old lady
		kill the sucker, crusher!

	spidey, really getting into it now, begins playing for the
	cameras.

				hipster
			(between two blondes)
		whatsamatter, crusher, can't you crush
		that bug?

				crusher
			(to spidey)
		okay, web face, this is it!

	he misses spidey again!

				hipster
		hey, crusher, you need a insecticide!
			(his blondes titter)
