	ext. the shack - night

	ock comes flying out and spider-man grabs a waldo.
	spidey does a back flip and whips ock so hard the waldo
	snaps off! ock recoils it and reacts in horror.
	with a roar, ock attacks spider-man. they battle as
	super-adversaries. ock gains the upper hand and tosses
	spidey into a pile of rusting drums. a gas envelopes
	spider-man and he begins coughing.
