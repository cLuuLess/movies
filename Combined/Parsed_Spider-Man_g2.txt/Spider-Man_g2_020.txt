	int. the dining room - night

	peter passes aunt may and takes his seat.

				aunt may
		a boy your age should have a girlfriend.

				peter
		aunt may... she has a steady boyfriend.

				aunt may
		peter, any girl that's worth your
		attention is of course gonna have a
		boyfriend... but if she really gets to
		know what you have to offer she'll... you
		get my drift?

				ben
		look, just leave him alone, okay. when
		he's ready for girls he'll be a holy
		terror.
			(winks)
		it's in the blood.
			(now serious business)
		lookit, how are you fixed for money,
		pete? maybe i can help you out a little.

				peter
			(lying to them)
		no, i'm alright. my scholarship covers
		almost everything, and i sell some photos
		here and there. today my physics
		professor asked for some of my work... he
		wants to study my data. they might
		publish my work in the science magazine...
		that'll bring me some money...

				ben
			(practically cheering)
		publish your work?! you hear that may...?

				peter
			(embarrassed laughs)
		yeah, in fact i have to leave a little
		early tonight, to meet professor
		octavius... he offered me to be his
		assistant...

				ben
		whoa! did you hear that may...?

				aunt may
		oh, peter, you promised you'd spend the
		night...

				peter
		i... i can't, aunt may. professor
		octavius wants to discuss my new
		findings.

				aunt may
			(disappointed)
		peter, what you should be finding... is a
		nice girlfriend.
