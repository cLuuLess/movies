	int. basement hallway - night

	skewed, strange, surreal, peter stares at the weirdness
	and fumbles with his camera. he snaps off a few shots,
	then freezes when he hears a familiar voice.

				roz (v.o.)
			(filtered through face mask)
		take it easy. take it easy with him.

				thorkel (v.o.)
		take him away and never bring him back!

	now we see roz and thorkel following 2 guards carrying ock
	in a stretcher. they all wear radiation suits. a waldo
	sneaks out from under the sheet and hits thorkel, as fast
	as lightning. he falls back. he's covered with a sheet
	and attached to life support equipment. octavius moans.

				thorkel
		what was that?

				roz
		what was what?

				thorkel
		what hit me?

				roz
		what hit you?

				thorkel
		i don't know. it was so fast.

				roz
		you're going to be fine, otto.

	peter gets off a shot and ducks into the men's room
	leaving the door ajar for a peak.

	a waldo slips down from the sheet. peter's eyes go wide
	at the sight. what in the hell has happened here?
