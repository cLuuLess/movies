	ext. construction roof - night

	the car arrives and liz jumps out. she's on nothing but a
	narrow girder! she tightropes on the girder. ock gets to
	the top. he looks across at her. she's stuck between two
	unfastened girders, at a dead end. he slowly telescopes a
	waldo toward her. she's got no place to run, no place to
	hide. he grabs her by the blouse and lifts her off the
	girder.

				spider-man (v.o.)
		put her down, ock.

	ock looks across the street. there, on the top of a tall
	building, is spider-man.

				spider-man
		i know what's happening to you, ock.
		i've been through a lot of changes myself
		lately. you have to listen to me.

				ock
			(holding liz)
		who the hell are you?

				spider-man
		spider-man.

				liz
			(seeing spidey)
		spider-man...

				ock
		that's a lot of crap, clown... i am
		spider-man, not you.
			(points to liz)
		ask you girlfriend.
			(to liz)
		tell him!

				spider-man
		i'm a good friend of peter parker's ock.
		just like that girl you're holding. now
		let her go.

	ock thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the
	kicking and screaming liz out over the street, ten stories
	up.

				ock
		let her go? what an excellent idea. if
		you do not deliver your friend, mr.
		spider-man, yes. yes, of course, i'll
		let her go.

				liz
		put me down, you mechanical mutant!

	liz is having none of this. she kicks, she fights. she
	twists. she flails around, making things a little worse.
	the ground is yawning death beneath her. rriipp!
	part of her blouse tears away and liz plummets!
	spider-man swoops down on a web-strand in his
	characteristic compound curve. he reaches out for the
	falling liz and misses her cleanly. the web is too short.

				liz
			(falling away)
		you jerk!

	he thwips her with a second web and together they swing to
	a high girder where he deposits her safe and sound.

				liz
			(straightening herself)
		tell your friend peter next time i'll get
		the taxi myself...

				ock
			(screams)
		hey... you jerk... you phony spider-man...
		prepare to meet your death, bug.

	spidey thwips a beam and swings across toward ock.

				spider-man
			(whispers)
		actually, i'm rather fond of living...
		especially now...
			(he looks at liz)

	he lands on ock's girder and the two progeny of the
	cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above
	the street.

				spider-man
			(a last appeal to reason)
		octavius. just stop and think.

				ock
		i am thinking, insect. i'm thinking
		about exterminating you!

				spider-man
		okay, if that's the way you want it...
		let's see what those chrome knuckles can
		do, doc...

	a waldo lances out and catches spidey flush on the jaw.
	it knocks him to another girder. spidey hangs on and
	rolls over. he rubs his jaw.

				liz
		great...

	spidey gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by
	another barrage of blows from above.

				ock
		now i must kill you, you cretinous clown.

	ock throws a roundhouse waldo that nearly knocks spidey
	off the girder. he's just barely hanging on.
	but spider-man's not done yet. he thwips a high beam and
	swings into a better attack position. the two super-
	adversaries engage in battle.

	with ock swinging from his waldos like a metal monkey and
	spidey swinging from his webs like, well, like spidey,
	they clang and bang through the girders of the
	construction site.

				ock
		once i dispose of you, spider-man, no one
		will be able to stop me.

				spider-man
		stop you from what...?

				ock
		my destiny!

	ock throws his biggest punch yet.

	sirens can now be heard in the street.

	spidey avoids waldo strike after waldo strike. ock eludes
	web after web. but spidey's agility soon has him turning
	circles.

				spider-man
		over here, octopus!

				ock
		that's professor octopus to you spider
		jerk!

				spider-man
		give it up, professor. you'll never
		catch me!

	ock takes three steps and soars through the air.
