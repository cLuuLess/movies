	int. aunt may's family room - night

	liz is standing. aunt may is seated on the couch, she
	looks weak, pale and alone.

				aunt may
		you're as lovely as peter said you were.

				liz
			(embarrassed)
		thank you. he really wanted so badly to
		come see you. he called me up out of the
		blue.

				aunt may
			(great concern)
		tell me about peter. what's he been up
		to? he seems so preoccupied.

				liz
		oh, you know peter... he's all caught up
		in some kind of study he's doing. things
		are really crazy at the university now.
		things are crazy... everywhere. i guess
		peter's just... well, you know... pulled
		into his shell.

				aunt may
			(reminiscing)
		when peter was little, he loved to hide.
		in the closets. under the sink. he
		always needed a secret place. but when
		i'd look for him, he'd always laugh... he
		wanted to be found.

				liz
		yeah... well. i don't think he wants me
		to find him... well, i'd better be going.
		my friend flash is picking me up.

				aunt may
		this flash... he isn't your boyfriend, is
		he?

				liz
		no... not really... i think you can guess
		why...

	they smile knowingly at each other.
	liz goes toward the door.

				aunt may
		elizabeth...?
		she turns.

				aunt may
		finders keepers, losers weepers.

				liz
		what?

				aunt may
		that's what i used to say to peter when i
		found him.
