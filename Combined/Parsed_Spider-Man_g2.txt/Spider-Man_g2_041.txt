	ext. rooftop montage - night

	with the uptown skyline behind him, peter casts caution to
	the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop.

	watching from the street, the man in the loud sportcoat
	follows peter's progress.

	peter leaps to a brownstone and lands amid the wash.
	he leaps up to a tenement and lands on a billboard across
	which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again.

	he touches down on a pigeon coop and bounds up and out of
	frame again. the coop owner, a latino in an undershirt
	and a yankees cap, comes running out of the coop.

	he's so surprised that he leaves the door open and twenty
	white morning doves fly away in a furious flapping, free
	at last. the latino lets out a stream of hispanic
	expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene
	gestures.

	peter slides down a cable to a lamp post, and swirls down
	the pole to a phone booth.
