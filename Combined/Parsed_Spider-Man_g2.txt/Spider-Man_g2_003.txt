	int. cyclotron area hallway - day

	it is a basement hallway full of lockers which students
	are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take
	stuff out. in their midst, a man is banging on the door
	marked "cyclotron room - authorized personnel only!"
	professor rosomorf, sixtish, respectable, a good old
	fashioned professor, he's the head of the physics dept.
	with him is alexander thorkel, a 40-ish, waspish school
	administrator. for a scientist as crazily focused as ock,
	thorkel is a natural enemy.

			(knocking furiously)
		doctor octavius! you are late for your
		lecture. the students are waiting.
		doctor octavius!

				thorkel
		your friend is impossible professor
		rosomorf, i told the board we should let
		him go.

	the light above thorkel's head explodes. then all the
	lights behind him explode in succession. thorkel and roz
	look amazed...

				thorkel
		what's he doing in there, not his crazy
		experiment again.

				roz
		you mean his anti-force theory... one day
		they'll give him the nobel prize for it.

				thorkel
		meanwhile he is demolishing our
		university. octavius!!
			(knocks)
		open the door.
