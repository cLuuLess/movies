	int. hospital room - day

				nurse
		you have a visitor, doctor...

	she leaves ock and thorkel alone.

				thorkel
			(enjoying this)
		octavius, i'm afraid i have bad news for
		you.

				ock
		the cyclotron is damaged...

				thorkel
		what used to be the cyclotron was
		permanently shut down this afternoon.

				ock
		but my work!

				thorkel
		your work is a disaster! look at
		yourself!

				ock
		myself? i don't matter. nobody matters
		anymore. to enter a new dimension we
		must first destroy our own...

				thorkel
		what are you saying?

	ock gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with
	his 4 waldos and 2 arms.

				ock
		destroy life. life is... insignificant.
		bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. what
		would you say?

				thorkel
		oh, my god, what are those horrible
		things sticking from your body?

				ock
			(gets more and more excited)
		thorkel, if i told you that for one
		moment in time i broke all the laws! for
		one brief glorious moment, i broke
		through to the other side. i saw... i
		felt... i became creation.

				thorkel
		what on earth are you rambling about?

				ock
		destiny!!! my destiny! i see it all so
		clearly now. universal destruction, yes.
		all i need is the power... then i can
		destroy this illusion you call life. it
		is my destiny to lead us to the light!

				thorkel
		you're a madman.

				ock
		and you are a fool. i will end the
		universe as you know it. and in that
		final moment... i'll laugh my ass off
		while you're kissing yours goodbye!

				thorkel
			(excited)
		goodbye is right, octavius... you're
		fired... sacked... canned. you are
		history, doctor octavius. and i couldn't
		be more pleased to be the first to tell
		you this good news...

	a waldo shoots up and grabs thorkel by the throat. he
	gasps and screams silently as the telescoping waldo lifts
	him off his feet. he rises until his head is just inches
	from the ceiling.

				thorkel
			(his last words)
		let me down ock... you crazy... monster!
		let me down!

	then ock smiles and slams thorkel's head through the
	ceiling. plaster rains down. thorkel's legs scissor and
	kick and then go limp. ock throws his dead body on to the
	bed, and covers him with the white sheets.

				ock
		okey, dokey.
