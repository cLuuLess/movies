	int. peter parker's apartment - night

	there's a knock at the door.

				liz
			(crossing to it, wondering)
		peter...?

	she is about to open the door when four waldos smash
	through it, obliterating it. ock stands in the shattered
	doorway, waldos writhing.

				liz
		doctor octavius...! you're... you're...
			(finds the words)
		you're so weird!... with those... what do
		you call those...

				ock
		waldos... did you hear about spider-man?
			(moving waldos like spider's legs)
		that's me... the real spider-man... now
		tell me, where is that jerky friend of
		yours... parker?

				liz
			(protecting)
		peter?... oh... he's not here. he's gone.
		i don't think he'll be back for awhile.

				ock
			(running his waldo in her hair)
		you wouldn't lie to your professor now,
		would you?

				liz
		of course not. why would i lie about a
		thing like that? really. he's... out.

				ock
		we'll wait.
		ock grabs liz's hair with his waldos.

				liz
		what are you doing... let me go! please...
		take those things out of my hair!

				ock
		my waldos, you mean.

				liz
		whatever you call them... please...

	ock shoots out two waldos. simultaneously each grabs a
	chair from different parts of the room and brings them to
	the table.

				ock
		sit.

	she does. he does, too, and folds his waldos across his
	chest.

				ock
			(chatty)
		he's a nice boy. a little nerdy maybe,
		but nice, wouldn't you say?

				liz
		oh, i don't know. maybe. he's very
		inexperienced.

	one of ock's waldos rests on the table curled around the
	computer. liz lets her hand rest on it. ock warms
	immediately.

				ock
		you know, you're a fascinating young lady...

				liz
		thank you...

				ock
		you're so refreshing. you're so...

				liz
		shocking...?

				ock
			(gone to far)
		oh, i wouldn't say shocking...

				liz
		i would!

	she sticks his waldo in the electric wall socket behind
	the computer! the current sizzles through him and he
	leaps up, waldos akimbo, like the "cartoon cat." liz runs
	out the door.

	ock extricates himself from the current and gives chase.
