	ext. major intersection - night

	taxis go by. two lovers stroll. we hear a familiar
	whine. the "walk" and "don't walk" signs flash at the
	same time.

	boy
	make up your mind!

	the signs explode! the couple stops in their tracks. the
	boy looks at the girl.

				girl
		what's going on?

	an arc of electricity now shoots between the light pillars
	of the subway station on the corner.
