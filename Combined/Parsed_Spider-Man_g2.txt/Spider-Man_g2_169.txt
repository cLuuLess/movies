	ext. university grounds - night

	the blue mg arrives and comes to a stop. ock looks at his
	two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself...
	picks up one drum on each shoulder.

				ock
		okey, dokey... have fun, young ones...
		for the last time.

	ock leaves. liz and flash are tied together in the back
	seat of the car.

				liz
			(still ministering)
		what do we do now?

				flash
		we kiss the world goodbye. if he is
		right, all there is left to do is...

				liz
		wait... i think i can release my right
		hand...
