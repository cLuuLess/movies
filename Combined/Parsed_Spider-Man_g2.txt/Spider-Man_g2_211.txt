	ext. the foundation - night

	liz is already down the rope ladder and is holding it for
	peter. he comes down with a huge bundle of red, white &
	blue.

				peter
		okay, stand still.

	he ties some rope around her waist.

				liz
		is this going to work?

				peter
		how do i know?

				liz
		i just adore confidence in a man.

				peter
		come on...

	they move to the edge of the rock and look down. central
	park is still a couple thousand feet down.

				liz
		what is it you say when you jump?

				peter
		your prayers.

	they scream as the building lurches again, knocking them
	to the ground. they start to slide across the rock. they
	reach out for each other but their hands don't quite
	reach.

	slowly, they inch back together, but the foundation cracks
	between them.
