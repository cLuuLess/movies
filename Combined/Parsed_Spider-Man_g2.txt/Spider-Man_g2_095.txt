	int. cyclotron - night

	a weird, flickering blue light dances around the hole in
	the cyclotron. then it cuts out. a helmeted man pulls
	himself out of a hatch. he flips up the helmet.
	ock is finishing putting together his new equipment.

	ock goes about checking out the cyclotron. it looks good.
