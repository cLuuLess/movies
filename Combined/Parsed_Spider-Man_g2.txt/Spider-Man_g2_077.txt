	ext. 59th street bridge - night

	the cabbie slowly changes the tire. fearing the worst,
	spidey gets out, looking for a ride. a truck approaches.
	spidey looks down at the cabbie and then up at the truck.

				cabbie
		hey! you wanna hand me that lug wrench?

	he looks up to see spidey go by, stuck to the side of the
	truck like a spider.

				cabbie
		some crazy kinda town...
