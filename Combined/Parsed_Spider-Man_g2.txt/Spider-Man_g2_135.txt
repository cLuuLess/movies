	ext. subway entrance - night

	a building roar rises from the subway entrance. then the
	sound of a train whistle! the boy looks down the stairs
	and has to leap out of the way as the broadway express
	comes highballing up the steps and blasts through the
	subway entrance.

	the train sails through the air.
