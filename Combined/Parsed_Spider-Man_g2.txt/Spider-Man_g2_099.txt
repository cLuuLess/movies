	int. peter parker's apartment - night

	liz enters, looking around. peter covers for this and
	that.

				liz
		what were you doing in here?

				peter
			(looking around)
		cleaning up. come on. i'll get your
		computer. where's flash parked?

	he picks up the computer and turns to her, but she's
	already looking around the apartment.

				liz
		flash didn't come.

				peter
			(holding it)
		oh. well... how are you going to get it
		home?

	liz walks into the room.

				liz
		taxi... i guess.

	she discovers the prints of spidey that peter has taped up
	around the apartment.

				liz
		you must spend a lot of time with this
		spider-man guy... peter! don't you think
		you ought to unplug that!

	peter looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall.
	embarrassed, he puts the computer back down.

				peter
			(embarrassed)
		i, uh, i'll go down to the corner... see
		it i can hail that taxi.

	peter leaves. liz smiles. she likes peter. why is he
	so...?
