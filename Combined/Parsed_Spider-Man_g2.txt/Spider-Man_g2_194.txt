	int. control room - night

	ock works the computer as the console sends up showers of
	sparks. he glances at the "bullet" which now pulses.
	the countdown clock at "00:04:18".

				roz
		where is it going otto?

				ock
		other worlds, roz, other times, other
		dimensions, who knows? who cares?

				roz
		then... why?

				ock
		truth, rosomorf. look at it! the new
		truth! the new way!

				spider-man
		don't listen to him professor roz.

				ock
		no, you don't listen to that clown, he
		can't save you, or the world for that
		matter.

	a waldo reaches in and rips roz off spidey, flinging him
	back against a wall. roz lands in a heap beneath a fire
	station (hose, extinguisher, axe).

	we see the waldo reach out for spider-man. it wraps
	around his foot and begins to tug, slowly...

				ock
		once and for all, spider-man... once and
		for all we'll end the legend of your
		powers.

	ock knocks spider-man with a real big blow with his waldo.
	ock is slowly dragging spider-man to a huge hole that's
	been ripped in the floor by the beams of electricity.
	we see new york a half a mile down through the hole. we
	see spidey being drawn across the hole. then roz comes
	flying in with the fire axe.

	roz hacks away at the waldo and chops it off! the stump
	withdraws. ock examines it in pain and fury!

				ock
			(ultimate betrayal)
		you!! you were my teacher!!!

	roz doesn't even look back. he and spidey are at the edge
	of the hole and he's shaking spidey furiously.
	ock sends out his other waldo and begins banging it on the
	floor in a frenzy on either side of roz and spidey. like
	a child denied, he smashes his steel fists against the
	floor again and again.

				ock
		you were my teacher! and you want to
		destroy my experiment. you are a
		scientist for heaven sake... don't you
		want to know what's up there?

				roz
		yes, but not on account of our world. we
		have only one world... only one life.
		the floor begins to craze and then crack like ice around a
		hole on a pond. bang! bang! spidey comes to just as the
		section of floor beneath himself and roz gives way and
		falls through.

	spidey grabs hold of the edge and dangles. he looks down
	and sees roz falling away beneath him, disappearing into
	the dark.

				roz
			(calling back from the dark skies)
		spider-man! only you can save us now...

				spider-man
		roz!!!
			(turns to ock)
		murderer!!!

				ock
		forget that old fool, insect. my
		spider-man... come join me on my
		fantastic voyage to the 7th heaven.
