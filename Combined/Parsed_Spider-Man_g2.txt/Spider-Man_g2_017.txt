	int. large computer lab - night

	it is dark and empty except for computers. sitting at it,
	lit by the glow of its screen, is solomon rosomorf (roz).
	as he works, a door opens behind him. someone walks
	quietly through the lab. rosomorf keeps working. the
	intruder approaches...

				thorkel
			(at his ear)
		professor rosomorf, what happened here?

				roz
		someone tried to rob me of some paper...
		i suspect they were looking for that one.

				thorkel
		what is it?

				roz
			(unruffled)
		award winning stuff.
			(turning slightly)
		peter parker's data on the planetary
		conjunction. damn lucky i hid it in my
		computer under another title.

				thorkel
		my god, what's going on in our school?
		first professor octavius almost blows up
		the physics lab... now this. you report
		it in triplicate, of course.

				roz
		thorkel, be careful when you talk to
		octavius. remember... the man is a very
		fragile genius. one day he'll bring us
		all the noble prize.

				thorkel
		rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous
		crackpot!

	off screen the voice of the cyclotron whine begins to
	build.

				roz
		that's him again. he's working day and
		night.

				thorkel
		i tell you the man is very dangerous.
			(the whine grows louder)
		come on rosomorf, let's stop him before
		this building will explode.
