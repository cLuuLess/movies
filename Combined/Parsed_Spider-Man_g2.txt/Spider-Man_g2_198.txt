	ext. the bottom of the building - night

	spider-man falls through the air. he shoots up a web and
	thwips, it sticks to the rocky bottom of the foundation.
	ock appears in the hole. he sees spidey's dilemma,
	hanging on a thread of web. a half-broken waldo snakes
	down and clips the web.

	but the web sticks to the waldo! ock shakes it, but he
	can't get loose. spider-man shoots out another web at the
	rock bottom and, with the leverage, he pulls ock out.
	ock swings down in a wide arc and his waldos catch on the
	rock upside down. he holds on fiercely.

	ock scrambles out to the side of the center and begins
	looking for an entry. spider-man is right on his tail.
	the building pitches sideways! ock turns to face spider-
	man, his broken waldos out for battle.

	spidey grabs an exposed pipe and breaks it off,
	brandishing it like a broad sword.

				spider-man
		let's have it, old boy!
		a bizarre duel takes place. the center pitches this way
		and that. spidey and ock move from foothold to foothold,
		from window to ledge to parapet.

	now the center pitches to a 45 degree angle. they duel
	upside down! a window grate crashes open and liz comes
	flying out, holding onto the grate for dear life!

				spider-man
		liz!!
		ock seizes the opportunity to whack spidey across the
		head. spidey loses his footing but the building now
		lurches back and liz goes flying back inside. spidey
		ducks inside too and pulls the grate.

	spider-man uses his great strength to move a huge piece of
	scientific machinery in front of the grate.

				spider-man
		come on.

				liz
		where's peter? he must be here somewhere.

				spider-man
			(pulling her ahead)
		he's around, don't worry... we'll find
		him.
