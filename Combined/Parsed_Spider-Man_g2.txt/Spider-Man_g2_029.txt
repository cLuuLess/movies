	ext. science center - night

	peter approaches a cyclone fence keeping low and out of
	sight. he leaps it like a skirmisher but fails
	ignominiously in a heap. he's torn his pants and cut his
	leg. he moves to the side of the building.

	a dumpster sits next to a fire door. it's locked. as
	peter mulls over his next move, the lock clicks and the
	door slowly opens. peter leaps on the dumpster... and
	falls in.
