	int. control room - night

	ock, in a white hospital robe walks through the surreal
	debris. two waldos reach out and "sense" the ripples on
	opposite walls. he runs a hand through his hair.

				ock
		what a wreck. what a useless, wasted
		wreck. okey, dokey. we rebuild you, my
		damaged darling. bigger, better, hotter!
		a world class, super cyclotron!

	he hears a noise behind him and reacts. and here comes
	weiner. bedraggled, shuffling through the control room
	door. he eyeballs the incredible wreckage.

				weiner
		there you are, doc... where have you
		been... whoa this place is messed up.

	ock turns, waldos writhing. weiner sees them and kind of
	ducks, remembering how he was hit by them once.

				weiner
			(smirks)
		whoa, doc! you look a little messed up
		yourself.

				ock
		where have you been, you imbecile?

				weiner
		i went to the wrestling...

				ock
		wrestling...

				weiner
		i went after the kid. you still want
		that parker guy's data, don't you?

				ock
		well, did you get it?

				weiner
		no, i followed him... but i lost him in
		the crowd.

				ock
		lost him? you--

				weiner
		i'll find him, maestro... i promise...
		soon... maybe by tomorrow.

				ock
		so how was the wrestling?

				weiner
		fantastic! there was this new wrestler...
		beat the mighty crusher. you won't
		believe it... a nothing of a guy... calls
		himself this stupid name... the amazing
		spider-man... would you believe it?

				ock
		spider-man, huh? well, maybe i'll just
		go and wrestle myself one of these days...
		with all my new arms... i'm sure i can
		beat crusher or any other monster.

	suddenly ock throws out his waldos from under his long
	white coat, grabs weiner and, lifts him up in the air,
	smiles cynically and with cruelty!

				ock
		will i beat him, this crusher, will i
		beat him or not?

				weiner
		no... no, please... i mean yes, yes...
		you'll beat him easily... let me down...
		please... i'll do anything for you...

				ock
		the parker data... get me the parker
		data, you hear?!!!
