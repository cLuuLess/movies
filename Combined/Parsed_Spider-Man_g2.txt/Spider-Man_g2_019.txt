	int. apartment of aunt may and uncle ben - night

	the n.y. mets are playing baseball on t.v. peter watches
	with his uncle ben, a paunchy 65 years old in polyester
	slacks and a comfy old sweater. a n.y. mets cap is
	perched on ben's head. a beer can is in his hand. a
	cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably
	around them.

	ben nods, rises sluggishly and slowly, and turns the sound
	off only. peter moves toward his aunt in the doorway.

				aunt may
		how's that girl you told us about, peter?

				peter
