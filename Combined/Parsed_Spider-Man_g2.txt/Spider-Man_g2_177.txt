	int. roz's car - night

	roz looks out over the skyline of new york. lighted
	buildings flare up and then go dark. the lighted spire of
	the empire state building flares up and explodes.

				spider-man
		it's started. step on it professor, or
		we'll never make it.

	they look across the campus and a strange light is coming
	out of the science center.

				roz
		our campus... right there... see those
		beams from ock's lab. we're late... it's
		coming... the conjunction will happen in
		a few seconds.

	spider-man massages his arm.

				spider-man
		stop the car...! come with me.

				roz
		where...? what...?

	spider-man shoots out a web and flies toward the school
	building taking roz with him.
