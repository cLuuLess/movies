	int. taxi - night

	through the window of the taxi we see madison square
	garden.

	as it pulls up, a sign reads, "midnight madness! mtv's
	rock and wrestling 'slammy awards!" the taxi come to a
	stop.

				peter
			(looking up at the sign)
		mtv wrestling?!

				reiss
			(getting out)
		that's the place. pay the man.

	max reiss gets out, he is carrying a box.

				peter
		look, mr. reiss... i'm not real
		interested in watching a wrestling match.

				reiss
		who said anything about watching a
		wrestling match? you're here to win a
		wrestling match!

				peter
		me? you must be kidding.

	reiss hustles peter inside.

				reiss
		you hop around. you know, the way you
		did last night. your opponent gets tired.
		he falls down. the ref counts to three,
		you win, and we pick up a thousand bucks.
