	int. cyclotron room - day

	everything is shaking like in an earthquake... roz and
	thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with
	anger and surprise. the whine is deafening! the light is
	blinding! weiner has his eyes closed and his hands over
	his ears.

				ock

				thorkel
		no!! don't do that...

				roz
		ock! its dangerous...

				thorkel
		ock i warn you...

	weiner crosses himself. the console erupts in sparks.
