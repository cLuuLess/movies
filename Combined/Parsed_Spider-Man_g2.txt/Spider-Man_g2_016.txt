	int. peter's apartment - day

	a one-room, shabby roof apartment, a chaos of books and
	papers. a photo enlarger and darkroom baths in kitchen
	pots; 8x10s tacked to the walls; a spare camera and
	lenses. self-consciously wacky kitsch; plastic dinosaurs,
	wind-up toys, a stuffed carp. an unmade bed and a 50's
	dinette set are the only furniture. a grimy skylight
	leads to the roof. it's not a pretty place, but it has
	personality. a voice from the kitchen, a shadow of an
	intruder, is sneaking around.

		there's nothing in there worth stealing!

				may (v.o.)
			(from within the kitchen)
		that's the understatement of the year.

				peter
		aunt may, you're trespassing.

				may
			(comes in)
		i was just so desperately bored... i
		thought i'd come over and make you dinner...

				peter
		i am old enough to... to make my own--

				may
		but i didn't feel like getting to know
		your roaches.

				peter
		i'll introduce you.

				may
		oh. and those foul chemicals in the pots...

				peter
		i take pictures, remember?

				may
		anyway, i've decided to kidnap you for
		dinner in forest hills...

	she grabs her coat, crosses back to peter and tugs on his
	shoulder.

				peter
		it's friday night...

				may
		yes. do you have a date?

				peter
		no.

				may
		then come on.
