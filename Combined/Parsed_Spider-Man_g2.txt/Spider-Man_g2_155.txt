	ext. street - night

	ock runs through honking traffic. spider-man leaps from
	car to car.

	ock turns to see spider-man leap to a limo at the curb.
	ock turns tail and runs down an alley. a female cop pops
	out of a doorway. her partner, a big, young cop, pulls
	his gun.

				female cop
			(gun poised)
		alright! freeze! up against the wall
		and spread 'em

	ock complies. he raises his hands... and spreads the
	waldos to full extension! the big cop screams and faints.
	the little female cop's eyes pop. ock swats the gun from
	her hand. he starts to choke her.

	spidey comes swinging to the rescue. he lands on the roof
	nearby.

				spider-man
		hey, you big ock, why don't you pick on
		someone your own size?!

				ock
		alright spider-bug... here i've come for
		you...

	ock leaves the cop and attacks spider-man, shooting his
	iron fist at him. ock runs to the end of the alley.
	spidey staggers to his feet and resumes the chase.
	ock breaks into a red corvette convertible, starting it
	with a waldo.

	spider-man comes out in time to see the vette drive away.
	a chinese laundry truck is passing. spidey thwips it and
	is whipped away.

	he crawls over to the window.

				spider-man
		hey, driver. could you follow that red
		vette for me?

	the surprised chinaman lets loose a stream of chinese
	expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures.
	spider-man crawls to the top of the truck and surveys the
	situation. he sees a sea of moving traffic. he thwips up
	a web and swings away.

	spidey swings along from building to building. the red
	vette is making headway. suddenly, spider-man spots a
	blue mg with its top up.

				spider-man
			(swinging)
		flash thompson... i never thought i'd be
		happy to see you.
