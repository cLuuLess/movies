	int. basement cyclotron room - night

	weiner is eating a large sandwich and a drinking a coke.

				ock
		i'll show them... closing the cyclotron
		on me... weiner!

				weiner
		yes, professor...

				ock
		where is he? it's ten past eight o'clock...

	a knock

				weiner
			(with mouth full)
		that must be him.
		he opens the door.

				peter
		good evening.

				ock
		you are late.
			(to weiner)
		weiner, go outside and get us something
		to eat. and don't steal it! just buy it.
		i'll reimburse you.

				weiner
			(to peter)
		do you want anything parker?

				peter
		no thank you, i just had dinner at my
		aunt's...

				ock
		piss off, weiner!

	weiner leaves. peter wanders around.

	he goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the
	spider which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open
	window... and into the chamber.

				ock
		okey, dokey, parker... how would you like
		to take weiner's place... i mean, be my
		assistant?

				peter
		well, professor, that would be a great
		honor, but i'm already working with...

				ock
		rosomorf... that imbecile. don't you
		understand, kid, that i am about to
		uncover the greatest discovery since
		einstein came up with his theory of
		relativity... the "anti-force."

				peter
		wow! the theory of the anti-force! you
		should go for the noble prize professor...

				ock
		noble shmoble, i am going for a much
		bigger prize kid. okey, dokey. let me
		show you, kid, what i got here.

	ock begins the experiment. we move in past the shattered
	window. we see the spider crawling on the chamber's gear.

				ock
		present maximum anti-force power to date
		is 38 percent of theoretical limit. i
		have patched in the variable
		particle-wave accelerator...
			(shrugs)
		i will now try to reach 50% power...
			(big breath)
		and if your paper has any value... i can
		use it to get the power i'm missing to
		create the anti-force, to break through
		and beat any other form of power in our
		or any other universe, capish!

				peter
		sorry, professor, i can't do it. i gave
		my word to professor rosomorf.

	ock is angry... ock now sees the spider. he shoots out a
	waldo to try and crush it but the spider is too fast. the
	waldo slams against the wall of the chamber. he starts to
	push every button or switch in sight. a deafening whining
	starts.

	an urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the "relative
	gravity" dial. it is at "4.999999kg" but suddenly the
	numbers start to tumble rapidly.

	insert: the glowing 5kg weight.
	insert: the power dial inches toward 50% power!

				ock
			(screaming)
		50 percent... anti-force... 50 percent...
		that's all i'm missing! parker, we can
		be rich together!

				peter
		sorry... i'd better go now.

				ock
			(really angry now)
		you'll be sorry, parker.

	peter leaves.

	another urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the
	monitor screen. on it, flashing red, is the word,
	"overload!" ock pushes the red power throttle forward!
	the whine increases to a pulse and throb.
