	int. last car - night

	it's nearly vertical! people are tumbled over each other.
	the scared teenager is tearing at the door. the skinny
	girl screams in a mechanical way. the door opens. he
	nearly falls!

	the skinny girl screams again. he manages to get back
	inside. she looks at him, safe now. but she screams
	again anyway.

	roz struggles to right himself against a pole. a bag of
	groceries goes sliding past him. it continues downward
	and out the open door.

	insert: the bag tumbles down through the air. down, down,
	and down...
