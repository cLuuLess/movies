	int. control room - night

	the countdown clock is at, "00:01:00" as spidey comes
	flying in with liz in tow.

				liz
		this building is flying. i'm in a
		goddamn flying building...

				spider-man
		i think we have to pull some of these
		cables. try those over there. i'll work
		on these. we gotta slow this thing down
		somehow. we got helicopters coming.

	liz looks at some wiring, apprehensive about even touching
	it.

				spider-man
		pull!

	she yanks out a cable. the building pitches. but when
	spidey pulls one out, it rights itself.
