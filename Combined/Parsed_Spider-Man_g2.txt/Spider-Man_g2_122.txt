	int. peter parker's apartment - night

	he drops into the room and pulls off his mask. the place
	has been ransacked. computer discs are all over the
	floor. peter pulls a file marked "planetary conjunction."
	he opens it.

	a piece of paper falls out. it says, "kiss it goodbye,
	wall crawler!"
