	int. men's room - night

	the urinals are twisted in bizarre shapes. pipes are
	exposed and spout water. the mirrors look like something
	out of a funhouse. peter hears the stretcher go by.
	peter goes to the door of ock's lab and cracks it. pan up
	to the spider, glowing softly, dangling from a shimmering
	strand above peter.

	as peter looks out at the stretcher, the spider drops on
	his neck. he reacts by swatting it away. bad move.
	the glowing spider now squats malevolently on the back of
	peter's hand. he stares at it transfixed. it bites.

				peter
		ow!!!

	peter throws the spider to the ripply tile floor where it
	scuttles unsteadily out the door.

	sweat starts to bead on peter's face. he shakes his head
	to clear it. his vision becomes uncertain. he lurches
	against a weird sink.

	peter's pov is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not
	just moving in and out anamorphically. it's all of that!

		hey! what are you doing here, kid?

	peter turns to see a uniformed guard distorted by his
	crazy vision.

				peter
		i feel a little funny...

				guard
			(heavily distorted)
		yeah? well, i ain't laughing. get out...
		just get out of here...
