	ext. dormitory - night

	they swoop down... and down... stopping on one of the
	building's sills, actually right in front of a window in
	the dormitory building.

				liz
			(tavern on the green)
		wow... look, this is our dormitory. i
		can get to my room. hey, wait a minute...
		there's flash, if i'm not mistaken.

				spider-man
		liz?

				liz
		you know my name?

				spider-man
		liz, listen to me. there's something i
		have to tell you.

				liz
		okay, put me down and we can talk,
		alright?

				spider-man
		do you know who i am?

				liz
		all i know is you're the amazing
		spider-man... or better you're spidey the
		good guy on the block... you're a weirdo
		in a clown spider suit.

				spider-man
		and that's all you know about me?
			(a beat, a sigh)
		okay, lets get your boyfriend.

				liz
		which one?

				spider-man
		how many do you have? i meant flash.

				liz
		well, flash is not exactly my boyfriend...

				spider-man
		he's not? then who is?

				liz
		there's someone i like, but he's too shy
		to notice.
			(flash appears)

				spider-man
		flash!

				flash
		liz!
			(a beat)
		spider-man!!!

				liz
			(to spider-man)
		you know everybody... flash we have to
		call peter!

	flash rushes right past liz to the window. there's a
	newspaper in his hand.

				flash
		hey, they won't let up, man!
			(shows daily bugle)
		they keep calling you an accomplice in
		that burglary murder. but that's a crock,
		ain't it? i'm with you, spidey, 100%

				spider-man
		thanks.

				flash
			(realizing)
		by the way, what are you doing with...
		liz?

				spider-man
		she needed a lift.

				flash
		oh... okay! this calls for a beer! a
		lot of beer!

				spider-man
		thanks, but i have some business to take
		care of.

				flash
		well... take care of that later. wait
		here. i'll get the beer.

	he disappears. liz comes, tentatively, to the window
	where spidey squats, desire and passion in his white eyes.

				liz
			(accusatory)
		how'd you know this was flash's place?

				spider-man
		peter parker told me all about it.

				liz
		peter told you all about flash?

				spider-man
		no... he told me all about you. see you
		later.
			(he jumps away)
