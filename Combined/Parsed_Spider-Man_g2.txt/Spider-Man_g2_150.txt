	ext. street - night

	cops, firemen, press, the works. the crowd gasps. camera
	strobes pop as the last car crashes to the sidewalk. we
	hold several beats on the incredible rubble.

	then, a webbed hand. spider-man groggily pulls himself
	from the wreckage.

				cop (v.o.)
		put your hands up, spider-man.

				spider-man
		you're making a big mistake.

				cop
		and you're looking at twenty years.

	spider-man shoots a wad of web goo onto the cop's gun and
	leaps up onto the luxury condo... and swings up out of the
	frame. the cop aims and shoots. the bullet makes a
	thwump noise. the web goo stretches out about three feet
	and falls limp.

				cop
		what the hell!
