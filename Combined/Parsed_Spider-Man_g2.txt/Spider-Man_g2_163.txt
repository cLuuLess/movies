	int. the well - night

	spidey falls. he cannot grab onto the slimy walls. at
	the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling blue luminescent
	pool. spidey claws frantically at the walls.

				spider-man
		noooooooooooooo!

	he gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the
	pool. its weird light shines up at him. he looks up at
	the starry sky.

				spider-man
			(to himself)
		okay now, spidey. easy does it.

	he shoots a web about halfway up the pit. it hits the
	wall, sizzles, and drops back down.

				spider-man
			(to himself)
		don't give up, spidey. don't give up.

	the web gizmo squirts out a pathetic patooey of web goo.
	then it hisses, empty!

				spider-man
		empty... now what do i do?

				ock
		so you've avoided the nuclear pool, have
		you, spider-man?

				spider-man
		well, so far so good. but i can't hold
		on much longer.

				ock
		pity...!

				spider-man
		oh, come on, ock, be a good sport. let's
		talk this over face to face... throw me a
		line...

	spidey reaches out.

				ock
		okay... face to face... catch this!

	ock, way up at the opening above, raises a huge drum above
	his head. the drum leaks toxic waste in orange tendrils.
	he is about to drop it down on spider-man...

				flash
		don't do it, professor!

	we now see flash and liz in the blue mg.

				ock
			(puts down the drum)
		i know you... and you, young lady. both
		of you are in my physic class, aren't
		you...? come... you can help me. i need
		to get some of these drums to my
		laboratory... help me... and i'll give
		you special grades. what'd you say?

	suddenly he catches flash with a waldo and starts to choke
	him. liz screams and tries to help flash.

				liz
		leave him alone!!!

	another waldo grabs her.
	roz now appears on the scene.

				roz
		leave them alone otto!

				ock
		but, they won't help me. everybody is
		trying to destroy my experiment. and so
		are you, rosomorf.

	another waldo grabs roz by his arm.

				roz
		otto... i was wrong. i've gone over your
		research. it's brilliant, otto. it's
		mad, but it's brilliant. you have much
		work left to do. i want to help you,
		otto. for the sake of science, go and do
		your experiment. leave... these kids
		alone and i'll help you.

				ock
		you will? you too?

	both flash and liz shake their heads okey dokey. ock
	gestures to flash and liz.

				ock
		help me with these drums, i need to get
		them to my laboratory immediately.

				roz
		do as he says.

	ock pushes flash and liz with his iron arm. gripping liz
	be her hair, he shoves her into the car.

				ock
		drive, flash, before i flush your girl
		right down the toilet!

				spider-man
		professor rosomorf, it's no good, double
		dealing... why did you help him...?

	rosomorf finds a rope and looks into the well.

				roz
		don't lose your energy screaming. catch
		this rope and climb up, come on!
