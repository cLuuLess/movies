	peter, liz, flash and harry all take books from their
	lockers.

				liz
			(whispers to peter)
		look, it's just... i don't know... when
		you and flash go after each other like
		that...

				peter

				liz
		he doesn't have to be.

				peter
		check.

				liz
		and besides, he's not all bad.

	peter looks at flash who's a few lockers down. flash has
	taken a football from his locker and is spinning it on his
	finger with great joy and concentration.

				peter
		you don't get nicknamed flash because
		you're a rocket scientist, liz.

				liz
		give it up, parker. you'd die for a
		nickname like flash.

				peter
		yeah, of embarrassment.

	kim comes by and leans seductively by her locker. kim is
	a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!

				kim
			(teasing)
		hey, flash... i'm scalping a pair of the
		midnight madness wrestling match tomorrow
		night.

				flash
		the slammies??? i'd kill for that!!!

				kim

		you tomorrow?

				kim
			(moving on)
		you snooze, you lose. hiya liz...

				liz
		kim, you know peter and harry? this is
		my new roommate... kim nickson.

	kim is pulling her pet, a foot long salamander, out of her
	locker. she wraps it around her neck and turns to the
	boys.

	they go bug-eyed!

				kim
			(interested)
		hellooo, peter.

				peter
			(embarrassed)
		hi...

				liz

		meeting. you coming?

	peter looks at kim. wow. then he looks at liz who's
	adjusting herself in a small mirror. harry jabs him in
	the ribs. yeah, yeah!

				peter
			(frustrated)

		bugle. i'm trying to sell some photos.

		it, shooshoo!

	everybody leaves and harry is left alone, he throws his
	bag down.

				harry

	peter turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking
	weiner.
