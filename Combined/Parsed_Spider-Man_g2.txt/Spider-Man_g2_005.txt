	int. college physics lab - day

	this is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. the yellowing
	smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. a huge
	american flag dominates the back wall.

	peter, harry and liz set up their tables. flash reads the
	daily bugle sports section. peter can't take his eyes off
	liz. when she looks back he looks down at his gear.

				liz
			(softly)
		what is it, peter?

				peter
			(embarrassed)
		it's nothing.
