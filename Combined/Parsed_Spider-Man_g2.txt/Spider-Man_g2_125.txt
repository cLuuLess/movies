	int. peter parker's apartment - night

	peter is working on liz's computer. there is a knock at
	his brand new, unpainted door. he hurries to it and pulls
	the knob so quickly (forgetting his own strength) that the
	whole assembly comes off in his hand.

				peter
			(pulling harry aside)
		i gotta remember to have that fixed.
			(opens the door)
		there you are, i've been looking for you
		all over town.

				harry
		what happened?

				peter
		where were you?

				harry
		i went to the wrestling, wanted to see
		that amazing spider-man, but he didn't
		show up.

				peter
		listen, harry something terrible happened.

				harry
		what? what?

				peter
		my planetary conjunction papers... they
		were stolen...

				harry
		oh my god... are you sure...? who would
		do such a thing?

				peter
		ock...

				harry
		of course... but why...?

				peter
		we have to find out, sit down.
			(indicates computer)
		i want to access dr. octavius' main
		program. i want to know about his
		experiments with the cyclotron. can you
		do it?

				harry
			(starts hacking)
		i can try. i could access the system in
		the dorm. okay. and through that i
		could crack the main line.

				peter
		alright. now if we can just disrupt the
		octavius file...

				harry
		okay, let's try.

	harry cracks his knuckles like a safe cracker and bends to
	the task. the phone rings. peter hits his jerry-rigged
	speaker phone. harry keeps hacking.

				peter
		yeah?

				jameson (v.o.)
		parker? peter parker? this is j. jonah
		jameson!

				peter
			(looking over harry's shoulder)
		mr. jameson, you got me at a bad time.

				jameson (v.o.)
		i need pictures of your friend, the
		amazing spider-man. but i need bad guy
		shots, you got it? lots of bad guy shots.
		we're gonna pin that insect to the wall.
		whaddaya say?

	peter hangs up. the dial tone cuts off jameson.
