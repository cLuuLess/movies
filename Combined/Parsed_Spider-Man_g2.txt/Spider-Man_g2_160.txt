	int. the shack - night

	ock is tossing away the canisters until he comes to one
	marked, "hazard!! plutonium sl 270 hazard!!"

				ock
		okey, dokey...

				spider-man
		open that now, and you'll spoil christmas.

	spidey's peering in from a hole in the roof.

				ock
		insect! i am going to squash you to
		death... once i lay my waldos on your
		skinny bones...

	ock hurls a drum at spidey. it erupts in a sizzle of
	liquid and gas. then the six-armed fiend runs for the
	door with his sl 270.
