		too late... ock's got your paper, it's in
		his computer already.

		but don't worry... he can never use it
		without plutonium.

				spider-man (v.o.)
		he's got the plutonium, and he's on his
		way back to the lab! and he's got two
		prisoners with him... liz and flash!

				harry
		don't worry... he needs a huge amount of
		power... thousands of volts of
		electricity... to get to the anti-force.

				spider-man
		he can get to the power. electrical
		power... to the max. nuclear power... sl
		270. and now, at the moment of full
		planetary conjunction. when all the
		planets line up with the sun... maximum
		gravitational power. the conjunction is
		ock's final power source.

				harry
		damn... the conjunction is due at
		midnight! what are we going to do?
