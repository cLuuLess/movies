	int. lab - day

	all the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating
	equipment.

	the charge crackles up a wire and erupts at liz's table.
	a breaker explodes in flames. there is an outburst of ad
	libs: "fire!" "everybody out!"

	thorkel (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing
	liz trapped behind the fire which is growing from second
	to second.

				thorkel
		keep calm, everybody keep calm. use the
		front door. everybody out the front.

				peter
		liz! come on...!

				liz
		i can't. help me!

				peter
		i'm coming!

	he wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the flames.
	his sleeve is on fire. he pats it out.

				liz
		peter!

	flash appears and tries to help but thorkel stops him.

				thorkel
		get back, you idiots. you can't go in
		there!

	liz smashes at the window, but this is an inner city
	school and the windows are covered by steel gates. liz
	wraps her fingers in the gate.

				liz
			(out at the street)
		help! help me!

	outside the window the air is clear and people come and
	go. some are stopping to look up at the girl on the
	second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)
	down at them as the flames close in behind her.

	peter comes flying in with a fire extinguisher. he
	fumbles with it. flash pushes thorkel, grabs the
	extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.
	liz turns to face the flames. suddenly there is an
	eruption of co2 clouds and the roar of a fire
	extinguisher.

	the flames are beaten down enough for her to leap out.
	flash is there, holding the extinguisher. people cheer.

				peter
		thanks for your help flash.

				flash
		no problem wimp.

				peter
		our hero has a real way with words.

				liz
		oh, why don't you grow up.

	peter is stung, insulted, turns away.
	rosomorf peeps in, worried -- faces thorkel.

				thorkel
		this man will bring a disaster upon this
		university.

	ock comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has
	happened.

				ock
		the universe is made up of forces... and
		counter-forces. science is the study of
		the forces!

	flash hands the extinguisher to peter. liz embraces
	flash, throwing a glimpse at peter who tried so bravely.
	he looks away and turns the last of the extinguisher on
	the last of the fire.

				ock
			(continues without a
			hitch)
		but i... professor otto octavius... have
		devoted my life to the study of the
		counter-forces! good job, peter.

				peter
			(taking place at lab
			table)
		thanks, professor.

	thorkel has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the
	front of the huge lab. he simply cannot believe ock's
	behavior.

				thorkel
		i don't believe it, i simply don't...

				ock
		can we carry on mr. thorkel.

				thorkel
		i don't believe... oh, all right carry on
		professor.

				ock
		well! this week my dear students i have
		made a stunning breakthrough...

				thorkel
		wait a minute, wait a minute... you've
		got fire forms to fill out, dr. octavius.

				ock
		i have no time for forms, or
		administrators who persist in
		interrupting me, mr. thorkel.

	thorkel steams out and bangs shut the door.

				ock
		i now believe its possible that these
		counter forces can be... collected... the
		way the magnifying glass collects the
		sunlight... and focused into a hard beam
		i call... weiner!

	weiner backs away from the blackboard to reveal a word
	that ock has scrawled in large letters. it says "anti-
	force."

				ock
		i call it, the anti-force!

	ock is plugging a huge cable into a small lucite box with
	a silver ball inside it.

				ock
			(continues as he works)
		this anti-force, once harnessed, is
		capable of undoing any natural force at
		which it is aimed... for instance...
			(looks up maniacally)
		gravity!

	liz scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity."
	then she turns to peter.

				liz
			(whispers)
		i'm sorry...

				peter
		it's alright.

	ock is "playing" his computer like the phantom of the
	opera at the organ.

				ock
		we patch in the cyclotron...
		the lights flicker and go dim.

				ock
		pay no attention to the lights... i of
		course steal its energy, and it looses
		power. we patch in the cyclotron... and
		we gradually apply power. the power that
		i am stealing...

	as the whine builds in the lab...
	ock peers through the lucite box at us, distorted by it.

	the box is a miniature version of the cyclotron's
	experimental chamber, and now the blue-white glow begins.
	it crackles round the silver ball.

				ock
		and so we stand, four square against the
		fundamental force that orders and
		maintains our universe... gravity...
		which is holding down this goddamn ball.
		rise!

	the lights go totally dark. the kids react with whoops
	and catcalls.

				harry
		what a crock...

				peter
		shut up harry... this is very interesting.

				ock
		mr. parker! have you some... interesting
		observation you'd like to share with the
		class?

				peter
		no sir...

				ock
		then shut up! and pay some attention to
		the experiment.

	ock peers at us through the lucite box as the silver ball
	begins to rise. ock's face is ecstatic.

				ock
		rise! rise!!!

	the silver ball suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of
	the box. it flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
	light fixture.

	the shards rain down on ock who reaches out and catches
	the falling ball and scales it in a raised fist.

				ock
		now that's what i call an experiment!

	the cyclotron whine cuts out and ock wheels to the
	computer. he hits a key and several colored projection
	beams lance out of the back of the room. they pierce the
	smoke and light a projection display in the front.

	two colored spheres one, yellow, one blue touch where
	their circumferences meet. behind them is a black
	depiction of "space".

				ock
		you are looking at a representation of
		two universes. our blue one. our real
		universe... something we can touch and
		feel and see and draw calculations about.
		this is us. the yellow universe... this
		is something else. some other dimension...
		something... on the other side!

	ock hits another computer key and a hole appears where the
	two spheres touch. the blue and the yellow marbleize with
	each other. the colors swirl until both spheres are
				bright green.

				ock
		if it were possible to generate enough
		power behind it, the anti-force could
		wipe out not just gravity... but all our
		universal forces at the same time. in
		effect... it would blast a hole between
		this universe and the next. each...
			(indicates green spheres)
		would flow into each other. no blue
		universe. no yellow. end, finished,
		over.

				liz
			(with a student's ear)
		that sounds like a scenario for the end
		of the world.

				ock
		my girl, it is! it is. it would mean
		wiping out everything that's known... and
		letting in everything that's unknown.

				flash
		isn't that a little dangerous?

				ock
		don't worry yourself, true inter-
		dimensional penetration is still purely
		theoretical, but one day... maybe very
		near... maybe in the 21st century...
