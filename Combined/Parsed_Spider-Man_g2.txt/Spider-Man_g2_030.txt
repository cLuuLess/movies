	int. dumpster - night

	peter lays in the garbage, a pained look on his face. he
	rolls over and comes face to face with a wet daily bugle.
	the headline reads, "wave of violence rips city!" he pulls
	himself up and peers out.

	he sees a uniformed guard hold the door open for three men
	in radiation suits who remove some weirdly fused objects.
	when they let the door swing closed, peter stops it by
	inserting the newspaper in the top.
