	ext. science center - night

	harry and flash and liz and kim, (the earth is shaking)
	come out running from the building beneath an enormous
	hanging moon. they are frightened.

	suddenly it all stops. it's quiet, the kids look at the
	sky.

				liz
		look at the moon... i have never seen it
		so big.

				flash
		what is that...

				harry
		must be the sun.

	we now see the sky. with the sun on one side, and the
	moon on the other. they watch it, shocked, frightened out
	of their wits.
