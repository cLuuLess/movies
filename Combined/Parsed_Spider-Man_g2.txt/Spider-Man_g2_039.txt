	ext. the taller building - night

	backlit by a full moon, peter somersaults to the roof of
	the taller building, and misses the top!

	he sticks to the brick facade, upside down! he laughs
	with the moment. a window opens below him and a pretty
	blonde in a towel sticks her head out. she looks this way
	and that, and all she sees is a man in a loud sportcoat
	down the street. never thinking to look up, she withdraws
	into the room.
