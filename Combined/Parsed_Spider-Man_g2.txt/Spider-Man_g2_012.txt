	int. control room - day

	peter enters wide-eyed behind weiner. this place is a far
	cry from the experiment in the lab room. it's a fantastic
	netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. no one
	but peter.

	ock is sitting in a swivel chair with his back to peter.
	he has the look of captain nemo in his nautilus. this is
	ock's domain.

				peter
		hello, professor octavius.
			(no response)
		i really admired your experiment.

				ock
			(back to peter)
		we have a lot of interests in common,
		peter. perhaps we should put our heads
		together, if you know what i mean...

				peter
			(flattered)
		that would be... great.

				ock
			(turns with a smile)
		now you take the planetary conjunction.
		this saturday night we will witness
		saturn, jupiter, the moon, the earth, the
		sun... all in a row. never seen within
		the memory of man, or measured for its
		effect. the total gravitational force
		must be quite exceptional. isn't that
		the subject of your paper...?

				peter
		yes sir, i've worked out a new way to
		calculate the combined gravitational
		effect.

				ock
		i'm a busy man, mr. parker. but i think
		i could find the time to go over it with
		you. make sure it all... checks out.

				peter
		well... i'm sort of working with
		professor rosomorf and he suggested we
		kind of keep it between us. he thinks
		that my theory is... well, i don't know...

				ock
			(to himself)
		the scoundrel...
			(turns angry)
		i want to see that data, peter!

				peter
		but professor octavius... if i knew you
		were interested... sorry, i've already
		given it to... professor rosomorf, and he
		is after all the head of our physics
		department... and i couldn't...

	ock turns sweet again. he smiles too broadly.

				ock
		well, i'm certain something can be worked
		out. run along, young man.

	peter begins to leave.

				ock
		just a minute... how about if i show you
		my discoveries... something i never
		showed to any other student... as a
		matter of fact to anybody at all.

				peter
		well i am really flattered, i mean i'd
		love to... but i...

				ock
		very well shall we say if you come here
		tonight...

				peter
		but professor i don't now if i should...

				ock
		make it eight sharp... i'll be waiting
		for you... right here...

	peter looks worried then leaves.

	ock turns to weiner who slouches against the wall smiling.

				ock
		the same academic world that's so keen to
		embrace that boy's undergraduate work,
		ridicules my anti-force theory as
		quackery. i ask you, weiner... what is
		our society coming to? ha!

				weiner
		they are all a bunch of brainless
		assholes, that's what i say...

				ock
		weiner! go get me that boy's data!

				weiner
		cost you fifty bucks.

				ock
			(weiner hissing)
		just get it. we'll negotiate your fee
		when you have the data, alright weiner?
