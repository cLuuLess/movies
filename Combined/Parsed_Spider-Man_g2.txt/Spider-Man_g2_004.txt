		the anti-force experiment has now reached
		the limit of electronic overload safety.
		therefore, weiner, you will disconnect
		the overload safety device...

	four waldos (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)
	suddenly thrust themselves into the chamber and begin
	working, each at a different task. ock is an acknowledged
	master at manipulating these waldos.

	he flicks a switch and a searing blue-white beam lances
	down from a focusing cone and strikes a gram weight
	marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our
	ears with a splitting buzz tone.

	the knock on the door grows louder.
	weiner comes up behind ock.

		whoa, doc... someone's at the door...

				ock
			(ignoring)
		world class scientific mind and they
		stick me in the basement with this third
		rate cyclotron...

	insert: the dial marked "relative gravity" reads
	"1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"

				ock
		okey! dokey!

	the weight begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it
	appears to lift ever so slightly.
