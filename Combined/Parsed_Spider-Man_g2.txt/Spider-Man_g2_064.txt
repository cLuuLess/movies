	int. cafeteria - night

	it is all dressed up for a party: lights, streamers,
	glitter ball, the works! harry is dressed as a spaceman;
	peter wears his regular clothes.

				harry
		you should have worn a costume. i told
		you to wear a costume.

				peter
		it's... embarrassing.

				harry
		there's liz...

	liz is crossing the dance floor dressed as an indian
	princess in an mini-dress.

				peter
		yeah...

	roz, dressed as a cowboy, ambles over.

				roz
		... howdy partners.

				peter/harry
		hiya, professor rosomorf.

				harry
		any word on doctor octavius?

				roz
			(falling in step)
		nothing beyond what i read in the papers.
		i'm afraid he's not the same man we knew.
		you know, i've been digging through the
		notes on his experiments...

	peter follows liz with his eyes. she takes a seat at a
	table next to kim who wears a harem girl outfit with the
	salamander around her neck. next to kim is... spider-man!
	peter's eyes go wide.

				roz
		you boys must have had an extraordinary
		classroom experience.

				peter
			(eyeing spidey)
		yes sir... oh... i'm going to be a little
		late with my paper on the planetary
		conjunction, sir...

				roz
		whenever you're ready... i'll look at it.
		i know it's going to be an important
		work... and peter, take my hat.

	he hands peter an oversized ten gallon hat.

				roz
		it is a costume party.

	peter and harry make their way through the dance floor to
	the table. peter can't take his eyes off spidey.

				harry
		look, there's spider-man!

				peter
		not the real one, i'm sure...

				harry
		you can never be sure... all kinds of
		crazy stuff can happen at a masquerade
		ball...

				peter
		i bet i know who it is.

	as they take seats, peter sees that spider-man is trying
	to read the bugle's sports section by party light. kim
	waves. peter nods and the big hat falls over his face.

				peter
		hiya, liz...

	liz moves to flash, who's dressed in the spider-man
	costume.

				liz
		hiya, peter. who is in the spider-man
		costume?

				peter
		it's a very clever outfit you've got
		there, flash.

				flash
		take a hike, asshole.

				liz
			(to peter)
		how did you recognize him?

				peter
		his pretty blue eyes give him away...

				harry
		anyway, who'll be sitting with you at the
		halloween ball?

				liz
			(whispers to flash)
		i wanna dance... hey, spider-man... shall
		we flash dance?

				flash/spider-man
		hey, i'm reading the paper, okay?

	liz turns with a mild pout. nervously, peter ponders his
	chance. harry nudges him.

				harry
		take her now, it's easy...

	harry turns to kim and does a clanking shimmy in the space
	suit.

				harry
		wanna dance, schechrezaa?

				kim
		i'm pooped.

				liz
		i'm not...

	she reaches for harry's hand.

				flash
		holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at
		these pictures of spider-man? wow! is
		this guy great or what?

	liz looks. she shrugs. then she shrieks.

				liz
		hey, peter! these are your pictures!

				flash
		can't be...

				liz
		it says here "photos by peter parker."

	peter reacts, then looks over flash's other shoulder.

	insert: there are three photos of spider-man in the paper.
	peter blushes, smiling.

				flash
			(takes off his head mask)
		you know this guy, parker?

				peter
		well, yeah... sort of...

				flash
		wow... i'll give you anything if you
		introduce us.

				harry
			(to liz)
		will you grant me this dance...?

	liz joins him provocatively.

				kim
		hey, flash-man... wanna dance...?

				flash
		well, why not.

	peter is left alone, peter leaves toward the entrance.
	at the rear door a big lizard passes a note to a dallas
	cowgirl who passes it to a kangaroo. the kangaroo hops
	across the dance floor to the stage where he hands the
	note to a young woman in a baseball uniform.

	she climbs the stage where she is bathed in a spotlight.
	she gets a drum roll from the band. there are some boos
	as the bad stops.

				young woman
		thank you, thank you. we have a special
		surprise guest tonight.
			(booo)
		the empire state university masquerade
		ball presents... the "slammy" winning
		star of mtv's wrestling tournament... the
		amazing spider-man!

	flash, amazed turns to liz. he points to himself and
	mouths, "me?" (the real) spidey drops from the ceiling and
	lands in a pose. the crowd cheers. he does a flip to liz
	and extends a hand. the band starts up. liz demurs.

				flash
			(whispers firmly)
		go ahead... go ahead!

	liz takes spidey's hand and they move slowly and sexily
	onto the dance floor. they do a short simple number.
	spidey returns liz to flash.

				liz
			(to flash)
		come on... flash...

	flash takes liz from peter (spider-man).

	liz and flash dance wildly. they finish to big cheers.
	the real spider-man slides to center floor. the crowd
	backs away as spidey spins out the greatest dance number
	in film history. he's all over the floor and on the walls
	and on the ceiling and on the glitter ball. he takes liz
	and flies with her. he breaks the place up. then drops
	in a pose. big cheers.

	liz stops breathless, very near to spider-man's face.

				liz
			(whispers breathless)
		who are you...?

				peter
		one day you'll know...

				liz
			(a long beat)
		you sound very familiar.

				peter/spider-man
		sure i do... i'm your friendly
		neighborhood spider-man!

	he jumps away and disappears, leaving the crowd aghast and
	liz in love.
