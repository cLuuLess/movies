	ext. science center - night

	the full moon hangs over the building. flash and harry
	and kim stand at the entrance to the center.
	flash starts to run to the building.

				flash
			(screaming)
		liz! liz come on out!

	they run forward but as they reach the front steps the
	building lurches upward. the bottom step becomes a wall
	of stone and dirt, six feet high.

				harry
		get back! flash... get back!

				flash
		wow...!

	then the building lurches upward again! this time it
	pulls free from the ground. the kids take cover as water
	lines burst and electrical wires spark.
