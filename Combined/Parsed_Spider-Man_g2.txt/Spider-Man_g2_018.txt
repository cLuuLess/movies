	int. cyclotron room - night

	ock and weiner are at work as before. ock takes no notice
	of the two men who come in, nor the worker who comes in
	behind them and sets to work attaching a big lock to the
	door.

				thorkel
		shut it down, octavius.

	ock ignores him. weiner touches ock's shoulder. ock
	ignores him too.

				thorkel
		you've blown half the circuits in the
		science center.

				ock
		call an electrician.

				thorkel
		i have called the locksmith.

				ock
		what... what is he doing.

	he points toward the worker who's working on the lock on
	the main door.

				thorkel
		we have to shut your lab down and take a
		look at the lines.

				roz
		please, otto, we must lock it up.

				ock
			(to thorkel)
		you're denying me access to my cyclotron?!

				thorkel
		you bet.

	ock glares back and forth between the two men, the worker,
	and weiner. then he pulls back the red power throttle.

	the whine descends.

	the waldos pull back and dangle from their panel. the
	whine dies.

				ock
			(contemplating)
		okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow.
		i want to clean up my papers. tomorrow...
		ha... tomorrow you can have this room...

				roz
		oh... well thorkel... few more hours
		won't make a difference.

				thorkel
		i hope.

	he signals to the worker to stop.
