	ext. the roof - night

	peter is flat on his back, staring at the stars. he sits
	up and looks wonderingly at his hands.

	on the back of his right hand are two puncture wounds
	surrounded by a faint blue-white pulsing glow. the glow
	disappears.

				peter
			(mutters to himself)
		this is weird. my god, i feel so weird...

	he leaps to his feet. he flexes. feels weird. good
	weird. in fact, great weird! he tries a couple of
	"jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the
	air!

				peter
			(exhilarated)
		very weird.

	the great, bespangled, new york city is his backdrop as
	peter jumps and turns and does loops in the air.
	with the agility and tactility of a spider, peter leaps
	from the railing to a wall to a flag pole to another wall
	where he lands sideways and sticks.

				peter
			(sideways)
		very, very weird.

	he leaps off the wall and lands at the edge of the roof.
	he looks down. no one's looking back. so, he takes a
	step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.
