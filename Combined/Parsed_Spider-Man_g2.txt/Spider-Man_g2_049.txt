	int. washroom - night

	peter takes the suit out of the box. it is the spider-man
	suit! he looks at it and shrugs. then he begins to
	struggle into it.

	peter is looking at himself in the mirror. he is dressed
	in all but the mask. and he looks terrific! he flexes.
	he smoothes his hair. he's starting to get into it.
