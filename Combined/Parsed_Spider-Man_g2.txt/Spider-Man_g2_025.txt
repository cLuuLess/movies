	int. basement hallway - night

	ultimate weirdness! the pulsing blue-white light
	penetrates first the door of the cyclotron room and then
	the very walls! lockers bang, lamps pop, the ceiling sags
	in a surreal, rubbery way.

	the walls sag too! the cyclotron sign pivots and embeds
	itself in a wall. a ladder sinks in the wall. the blue-
	white light dances wildly about in pulses. then,
	suddenly, it stops... dead silence. weiner comes running
	in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of
	pepsi. weiner enters ock's lab, singing, not at first
	noticing what's going on. suddenly he stops dead.
