	int. jameson's office - day

	very forties, very messy. j. jameson scans some photos as
	peter stands helplessly by.

				jameson
		bag ladies. i hate bag ladies.

				peter
		yes, sir.

	jameson is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top.
	he too is forties. his chewed up cigar is forties. this
	guy is a hard case.

				jameson
			(looks at the other photos)
		little kids... i hate little kids. this
		is a daily newspaper. we need news value
		photographs, not artsy-fartsy shit!

				peter
		yes, sir.

	jameson comes to a picture of a business suited man with a
	mohawk. peter smiles in anticipation.

				jameson
		kid? you want a pro's assessment?

				peter
		yes, sir!

				jameson
			(handing photos back)
		your photos suck.
			(cigar for emphasis)
		parker, my readers are morons. i gotta
		grab them by the eyes. every time you
		press the button of that nikon of yours
		it costs you fifty-five cents. so the
		next time you're about to take the plunge,
		ask yourself, am i taking dog bites man?
		because if you are...

				peter
		i know, i know. you want man bites dog...

				jameson
		parker, this is the post modern 20th
		century. i want man eats dog! get out!
