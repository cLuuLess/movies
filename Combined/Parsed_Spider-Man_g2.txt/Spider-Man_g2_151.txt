	ext. back of building - night

	spider-man swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the
	end of a web strand. after falling ten stories, he is
	groggy and weak. he can't think. he can't focus. he can
	barely hold onto his wrist gizmos. this bug is spent.

				spider-man
		must go on... must find ock... sl 270
		plutonium... must get that crazy old
		loony... before he gets to the
		plutonium... toxic dump... where are the
		toxic dumps...?

	he hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and
	thinks. he shoots a web up diagonally and swings across
	on it. this time he catches on and holds, but barely.
