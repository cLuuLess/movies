	ext. city street - near a hospital - day

	we are tight on a new york journal truck. on its side
	banner is a picture of spider-man's face. headline: "who
	is he? mega-smash hits mtv!"

	the truck pulls away and we see peter, liz, harry and kim
	standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. peter is
	rocking on his heels and smirking.

				peter
			(indicating truck)

				liz
			(walking ahead)

		night... boy does flash think he's hot.

				peter

				kim

				harry
		wrestling is all bluff. do you really
		believe this little guy in a stupid
		spider-man suit beat the crusher?

				liz

		will be over soon.
