	roz is hanging in mid-air on the web.
	roz shouts.

				roz
			(shouting)
		there's only one place he can get the
		plutonium sl 270...

				spider-man
		where...?

				roz
		toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump
		would have sl 270.

	spidey swings roz in an arc to the fireman. he misses roz
	on the first pass. roz looks up at spidey who stands in
	the doorway, manipulating the web.

	the fireman grabs roz. then, with an awful screech of
	steel, the car pulls loose from the coupling. with
	spider-man inside it, the car plunges ten stories to the
	street below.
