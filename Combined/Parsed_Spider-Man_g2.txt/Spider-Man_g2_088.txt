	ext. cop car - night

	elite cops in baseball caps are plotting strategy.

				cop #1
		that place is loaded with solvents and
		chemicals. if we blast our way in, it's
		gonna go up like a roman candle.

				cop #2
		we could go in through the fifth floor
		wash room.

				cop #1
		what's that up there? throw a light on
		that!

	cop #1 directs the beam of the searchlight.
