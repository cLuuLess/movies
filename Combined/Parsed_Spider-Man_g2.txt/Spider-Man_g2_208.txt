	ext. fire door - night

	spidey and liz are falling away from the door, sliding
	along the rock. liz is stopped by a retaining wall.
	spidey keeps sliding. he thwips the wall and then
	disappears over the edge. liz screams!

	liz fights to her feet and grabs onto the web stand. she
	pulls on it with all her strength. she pulls and pulls
	and pulls. we see the web running up between the rocks.
	she gives one last pull and comes up with an empty web
	end.

	a long, long beat.

				peter (v.o.)
		liz, up here!

	liz looks up and sees peter hanging out the window two
	stories above her. he throws out a rope ladder. liz
	grabs it. she begins to climb.
