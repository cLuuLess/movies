	ext. the dump - night

	ock's waldos are coiled around spider-man's neck as the
	web slinger is dragged through the dump. his white eyes
	narrow and blink. there is a capped well behind a warning
	sign. ock tears off the cap and then hurls the groggy
	spidey down the well.

				ock
		goodbye, spider-man!
