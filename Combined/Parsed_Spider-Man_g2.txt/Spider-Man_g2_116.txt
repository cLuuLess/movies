	ext. the roof - night

	spidey lands next to liz in a pose. lit by the flashing
	billboard, he's weirder looking than ever. spidey puts an
	arm around liz and extends a web shooter.

				liz
		what do you think you're doing?

				spider-man
		i'm rescuing you.

	with that spidey leaps way out and he and liz swoop away
	on a web-strand.
