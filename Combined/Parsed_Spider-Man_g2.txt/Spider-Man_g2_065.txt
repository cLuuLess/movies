	int. ben and may's family room - night

	ben is flicking through the channels of his tv, aggravated
	as usual. it's all rock videos!

				ben
			(to may)
		what a bunch of crap. goddamn rock and
		roll's screwed up the whole tv.

	he flicks off the set and turns to may who's asleep on the
	couch. he gently nudges her.

				ben
		come on, may. wake up and go to sleep.
