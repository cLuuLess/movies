	int. peter parker's apartment - night

	peter and harry are at a computer. the lights flicker and
	dim. then they go back on. peter and harry look at each
	other and shrug.

				harry
		got something!

	insert: digital clock display: "06:00:03"

				peter
		what is it?

				harry
		let me see. it's some kind of countdown
		clock.

				peter
		countdown to what?

				harry
		i don't know, but whatever it is, it's
		only six hours away.

				peter
		the planetary conjunction?

				harry
		could be...

				peter
		or doc ock's end of the world experiment...
		or both!

				harry
		wait a minute. you're not telling me you
		think the world is gonna end tonight...?

				peter
		you want to wait around till midnight to
		find out?

				harry
		no, but...

				peter
		let's see what else we've got.

	another set of numbers roll up on the screen. they are
	accompanied by electrical symbols.

				harry
		what's that?

				peter
		it might be a calculation of the amount
		of power he needs to create the hole
		between the force and the anti-force.

				harry
		that's a lot of energy. what could
		generate power like that?

				peter
		the closest you could come is the new
		york city subway system.

	again, the lights flicker and then dim and they return.

	harry/peter
			(together)
		we gotta talk to professor rosomorf!!
