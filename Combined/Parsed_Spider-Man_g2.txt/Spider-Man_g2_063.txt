	int. cyclotron room - night

	weiner is putting on a clown suit. he fastidiously puts
	his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a pipe. the
	pipe turns into a snake. it is, in fact, a waldo!

				ock
			(turning from work)
		what do you think you're doing?

				weiner
		i'm going to the masquerade. it's
		halloween tonight doc, aren't you coming
		to the school ball? whoa, you could go
		without an outfit.

	a waldo whips around weiner's throat... aarrrgh!

				ock
		you're not going to any ball, clown.
		you're going to get me peter parker's
		data...

				weiner
		i was almost killed on my last try...
		look at all these bruises...

				ock
		i don't care if you come back dead. just
		get it!

				weiner
			(croaking)
		cost you a thousand bucks, if i get it.

	the waldo coils tighten around weiner's throat.

				weiner
		all right... boss please let go...
		p l e a s e ...

				ock
		just get it, weiner. i'm running out of
		time. if you fail me again, you won't
		have to concern yourself with money
		anymore... do you get me clown?!

	weiner croaks his assent.
