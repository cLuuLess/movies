	int. experimental chamber - night

	through the blue-white we can barely make out ock on the
	other side if the shattered window. he sends two waldos
	after the spider. the spider evades him and jumps onto
	the professor's back. it then climbs onto the professor's
	neck and bites him.

				ock
			(anguish)
		noooooooooooo!

	the gravity dial goes to .000001, then pops back up as
	ock's tiny world goes berserk. dials spin, crack, explode
	or droop liquidly. wires dance on the console which
	erupts like the 4th of july.

	ock begins to float. his shirt begins to tear away. a
	dial floats by with its pulled wires undulating like a
	medusa. waldos smash through the walls and flail like
	snakes. ock's yellow thermos distorts and explodes!
	ock, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-g grimace, is
	pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with
	sparks.

				ock
			(ecstasy above the din)
		it's an energy storm! okey! dokey!

	we see clearly the spider still stuck to his neck.
	the big beast buffets and shakes. tubes, junctions,
	valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where
	they twitch and writhe with a life of their own.

	then, an enormous explosion rips a large hole in the
	cyclotron's side, sending debris and a hundred micro-
	streams of electronic particles lancing in our direction.
