	ext. university - night

	peter melds into the crowd. as in a dream, jameson
	appears at his side.

				jameson
			(distorted)

				peter

	he hurries off. peter peers after him and all of a sudden
	his vision corrects to a perfect focus. the sweat is
	gone. he's okay. he makes his way through the crowd to
	the street.

	we track with peter as the madding throng recedes behind
	him. he turns a corner. he hears a siren.

	an ambulance screeches around the corner. it nearly hits
	peter who leaps to avoid it.
