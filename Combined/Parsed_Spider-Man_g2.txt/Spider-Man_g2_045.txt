	int. hospital operating room - night

	ock is prepped for surgery. gowned personnel hurry about
	with a feverish urgency. the chief surgeon checks the
	sensors attached to ock's head. these seasoned
	professionals are astonished and frightened.

				chief surgeon
			(whispers)
		look at these brainwave readings. the
		mental activity is ten times of any
		normal man...!

				brainman
			(whispers)
		equipment malfunction...?

				chief surgeon
			(whispers)
		hell, yeah... his.
			(checks ock's chest)
		my god... i thought i'd seen everything...

				surgeon #2
			(whispers)
		but this is beyond medicine. this is
		madness...!

	ock lays bare chested, face up, all four waldos splayed.
	he is a true cyborg. part man, part machine. part
	organic, part molybdenum steel.

				nurse
			(leaning in, blitzed)
		it is so freaky...

				chief surgeon
			(stern for the staff's
			sake)
		okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking.
		i want to go in at the upper thoracic.
		then we'll work our way around.
			(slaps ock's shoulder)
		hang in there, man.

	insert: the waldo nearest the slap moves ever so slightly.
	the triangular claw rotates a quarter turn and then turns
	back.

	the nurse sees it and screams.

				chief surgeon
			(glares)
		nurse! number seven scalpel.
		arthroscope stand by. read out
		parameters in progress. let's go in.
		you alright?

				nurse
		yes... yes, of course. everything's
		online.

				chief surgeon
		scalpel! no... no... a larger one...
		the largest we have!

	she slaps a huge one into his palm. he takes a deep
	breath and goes to work. masked heads gather round him.
	the scalpel is poised at the line where skin meets steel.
	we make an incision. the instruments go crazy. warning
	bells and buzzers sound.

				head nurse
		kill the alarms!

				brainman
		he's going off the chart!

	a waldo flashes around the steel leg of the operating
	table and clanks tight!

				chief surgeon
		mop. mop! sutures and clamps! hurry up!

				surgeon #2
		we're losing him. defibrillate!

	a heart machine is rushed in. they work frantically.

				chief surgeon
		zap him!

				brainman
		stabilizing alpha waves...

	surgeon #2 applies the cardiac shock pads.
