	int. cyclotron room - night

	a scene out of dali's surrealistic canvas. there are
	things inside of other things. dials look like dali
	watches. this place has been rippled to the max!
	ock lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a waldo across
	his chest. the spider is weaving its web. camera slowly
	down to see ock. pipes and wires are stuck to his body.
	the waldo seems to be wrapping him. he wakes up to see
	those mechanical arms buried in his body. they weave
	around him as if they are looking for prey. he tries to
	tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body,
	like his other limbs. he screams. suddenly weiner sees
	ock.

				weiner
		professor... what happened to you? what
		did you do...

	suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he
	flies back and out through the door to the corridor.
