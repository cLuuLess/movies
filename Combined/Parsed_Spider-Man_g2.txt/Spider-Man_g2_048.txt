	int. catacombs madison square garden - night

	we can hear the crowd screaming at something in the
	background as reiss leads peter to an employee washroom
	and shows him the box.

				reiss
		you're really gonna love this.

				peter
		look, really, i don't know...

				reiss
		you don't have to know. i know enough
		for both of us.
			(pause)
		change in there.

				peter
		what is this?

				reiss
		a costume... something that fits your
		talent. go put it on. i'm sure you'll
		like it.

	he slaps the box against peter's chest and all but pushes
	him inside.
