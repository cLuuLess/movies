	int. roz's car - night

	they drive along the highway. spidey is recovering,
	working his neck.

				roz
		i've been through the octavius data. he
		has enough power with his plutonium.
		especially if he gets his hands on
		parker's data, there he has enough power
		to do what he wants to do. and we are
		not going to stop him in time before the
		planetary conjunction occurs tonight...

				spider-man
		stop the car. i have an idea.

	they're in the middle of riverside drive but a phone booth
	is coming up on the right.

	insert: roz's foot stabs the brake.
