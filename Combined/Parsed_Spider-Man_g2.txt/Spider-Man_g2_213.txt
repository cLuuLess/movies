	ext. the sky - night

	there is a beautiful full moon. peter and liz float down
	into the frame lit by its wonderful light.

	the american flag which has turned into a huge parachute.
	they hold each other tight. they can hear sirens below.
	they begin to laugh with relief. then they stop. the
	wind billows liz's skirt and plays with peter's hair, and
	snaps in the american flag.

				liz
		we have a lot to thank your friend
		spider-man for.

				peter
		somehow, i don't think we've seen the
		last of him.

				liz
		peter...! finders, keepers...

				peter
		what...? what is it? why do you look
		like that?

				liz
		i think i'm in love.

				peter
			(even his eyes blush)
		you are...

				liz
		with your friend...

				peter
		spider-man? you're in love with
		spider-man?

				liz
		i am... you think we'll see him again?

				peter
		we might... you never know.
		he kisses her.

				liz
		oh.
			(bittersweet)
		this may be the end of a beautiful
		friendship you know?

				peter
		nah.

	they land in the center of the park under the parachute.
	they stay there and kiss... completely covered by the
	flag. camera pulls up to show the building floating away.
