	ext. end of the world montage - night

	suddenly from ock's basement lab a blue beam of light
	breaks through. a whine starts, it moves magically out of
	the window and pans around a sleepy new york which doesn't
	know that the end is upon it. the dreaded whine builds
	throughout! people stop in their tracks, look up to the
	strange looking skyline. camera comes down to a street
	where roz is driving spider-man fast toward the
	university.
