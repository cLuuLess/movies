	ext. empire state university - day

	as students go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills
	out of the science center onto the grounds of empire state
	university.

	we see peter parker, a pleasant faced senior who's among
	the top in his class. sincere and serious, he has yet to
	develop a way with women.

				liz
			(falling in step)
		hiya peter...

	liz allen is also a senior. she's beautiful and
	intelligent.

				peter
			(ardent but
			uncomfortable)
		hiya liz... how're you doing...?

				liz
			(teasing softly)
		how'm i doing what?

				harry
		peter! peter! wait up!

	harry is the school nerd. a quirky kid who, like peter,
	can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty
	ones like liz.

				harry
			(to liz)
		would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?

	despite peter's protesting body language, harry pulls him
	away like a conspirator.

				peter
		what is it? what...

				harry
		did the astro-physics journal really
		accept your paper?

				peter
			(laughs, embarrassed)
		yeah... well... all i got's the data but
		they've agreed to publish it when it's
		finished. you know... it's my
		calculation on the planetary conjunction.

				harry
		and its influence on the anti-force.
		isn't it?

				peter
		yes. look, harry, i am busy with...
			(indicates liz standing
			there)

				harry
		yeah, you and the rest of the class.
		every one is busy with liz.

				liz
			(growing impatient)
		peter?

	a hand reaches in and smacks her bottom.

				flash
		hiya, cupcakes...

				liz
			(elbowing him
			affectionately)
		flash...!

	they kiss and walk away.

				harry
			(sneering)
		and flash is the busiest of them all...

				peter
			(disappointed)
		come on, harry... we'll be late for
		octavius.

	harry makes a gesture dismissing ock as crazy.

				harry
		ock is nuts, don't you agree?

				peter
		ock is a genius, harry. crazy, yes! but,
		a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.
