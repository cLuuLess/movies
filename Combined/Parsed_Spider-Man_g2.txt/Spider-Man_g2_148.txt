	int. last car - night

	now only roz is left. spidey approaches him. he clings
	to a pole.

	insert: the coupling bends open! the car is hanging there
	from memory!

				roz
		this is doctor otto octavius' work. i
		must get back to my university. i must
		stop ock... he's gone crazy. can you
		help me?

				spider-man
		sure thing, just don't take the train.
		come on... give me your hand.

				roz
		spider-man! listen to me! if he can do
		this with the train, if he's come this
		far, then i can pretty well predict his
		next step. he'll go to plutonium sl 270
		for the power. he must be stopped... or
		else he'll destroy our world.

	the coupling shrieks and the car lurches.

				spider-man
		let's get you out of here first,
		professor.

				roz
		wait spider-man. i don't think i can
		make it... you mustn't waste time saving
		me... you must save the world! you must
		go and stop ock!

				spider-man
		where can i find him...?

				roz
		he is looking for plutonium sl 270 i'm
		sure...

	the car lurches on its side and roz flies out of the door.
	spidey thwips out a web that girdles roz's waist.

				spider-man
		think rosomorf, think where one can find
		plutonium? where could he find sl 270...?
