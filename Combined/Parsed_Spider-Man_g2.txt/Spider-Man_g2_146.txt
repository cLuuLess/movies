	int. the last car - night

	spidey arrives at the door at the top of the car. he sees
	roz at the bottom. three people are between them. the
	skinny girl sees spidey. she screams.

				spider-man
		okay, folks, just hang on...

	he scampers down the grab-handles to the people below.
	four passengers cling to seats and bars.

				spider-man
		okay, one at a time. you first, ma'am...

	a fat woman makes a "who me?" gesture. spidey throws her
	over his shoulder.

	insert: the coupling which holds the two cars at right
	angles begins to bend open.

	spider-man, the fat woman over his shoulder, goes hand
	over hand to the top and the woman is dumped into the
	middle car.

	insert: the coupling bends open a little more.

	spidey helps the teenager and the skinny girl out of the
	car. she takes the dreadful step between cars. she looks
	down. she screams. she steps across.
