	ext. the science center - night

	we pan down from the moon to a street full of sirens and
	shadowy figures running in the night. liz and kim and
	harry come nearer. a very weird light is emanating from
	the center.

				liz
		he's in there. i know peter is in there.
		she breaks into a run.

				flash
		liz, don't... liz come back... come back!
		liz runs inside. they run after her. a bolt of
		electricity flashes across the doorway, stopping them.
