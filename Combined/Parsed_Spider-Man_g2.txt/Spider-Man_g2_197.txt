	int. control room - night

	the countdown clock is at, "00:02:59". ock throws the
	power throttle to 98% power. he laughs and a web splats
	against his glasses. spidey scrambles to his feet. ock,
	still trying to get the web goo off his glasses, is
	slammed into the console by spider-man. sparks fly and
	waldos flail blindly, smashing things. ock tears off his
	glasses and squints through the fire and smoke and glare.
	spider-man thwips the ceiling and swings into a drop kick!
	ock recovers. he grabs spidey and slam dunks him through
	the hole in the floor.
