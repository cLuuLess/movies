	ext. peter parker's rooftop - day

	a camera is mounted on a tripod facing us. a timer winds
	down and it clicks.

	reverse angle - camera's pov.
	spider-man is clinging to the side of a wall.

				spider-man
		and one like this...
			(changing pose)
		and one looking real sincere.

	the white eyes narrow to a slit. click.
	suddenly he spots weiner climbing onto his roof. he
	hides.

	weiner tiptoes into the roof apartment. spider-man jumps
	in and grabs him.

				spider-man
		what are you doing here?

				weiner
		i'm looking for peter parker.

				spider-man
		oh, yes... so why not use the front door?

	spider-man throws him back onto the roof so that he almost
	slides over the edge. weiner turns, facing spider-man.

				weiner
		hey, i know you...

				spider-man
		you do?

				weiner
		i saw you crushing the crusher.

				spider-man
		you like wrestling?

	spider-man jumps and reaches weiner.

				weiner
		i love it! you are the best wrestler i
		have ever seen... please don't hurt me!

	spider-man picks up weiner, throws him up to an antenna
	above the building, to which weiner clings desperately.
	spider-man circles the antenna.

				weiner
		oh, please... don't kill me. please help
		me down.

				spider-man
		of course i'll help you down. i am
		spider-man... the good guy, am i not?

				weiner
		yes... yes, you are.

	spider-man jumps to the chimney, picks weiner up in his
	arms and whispers to him.

				spider-man
		and by the way, peter parker does not
		live here anymore...

	spider-man jumps with weiner in his arms to the edge of
	the roof.

				spider-man
		and tell the professor he can't have
		peter's data. goodbye.

	spider-man drops weiner off the roof, three floors
	straight down into heavy bushes below.
