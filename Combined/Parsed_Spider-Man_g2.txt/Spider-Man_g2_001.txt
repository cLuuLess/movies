	int. professor ock"s private physics laboratory, the
	cyclotron room (credit sequence) - day

	a mighty warning klaxon assaults our ears. a flashing red
	warning light stabs our eyes.

	several dials go into the red. a hand pushes aside a
	yellow thermos and pushes forward a red power throttle.
	we hear the whining up of a cyclotron. a digital dial
	climbs to "5% power." a spider crawls across a dial.

	begin opening credits.

	the cyclotron room is in an old basement full of peeling
	paint and plumbing wrapped with tape. leaks are here and
	there. cobwebs are all around.

	doctor otto octavius (ock) is a strong but strange
	featured man in his mid-fifties.

	his assistant, weiner, hovers nearby looking on. he's
	open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. weiner is
	a local, small-time hood hired by ock to circumvent the
	school administration and to "procure" whatever ock needs
	for his experiments. he shades his eyes against a searing
	blue-white beam that erupts from the window. the room is
	divided into a control room and the experiment chambers.

				weiner
		whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?

	with a whoosh, the window explodes, showering the two with
	shards of glass, and throwing them to the floor.

				ock
			(rising)
		we begin again... let's kick in that new
		transducer. see if we can double the
		power output.

				weiner
			(rising more slowly)
		whoa, doc... wait a minute...

	but ock is already at the throttle. the cyclotron whirls
	up. the lights go on. louder, brighter than before. ock
	looks through the broken window into the experimental
	chamber. the power dial inches upward, "eight, nine..."
	the blue-white light is blinding now. the whine pitch is
	shattering.

	end opening credits.

				ock
		okey... dokey!

	the power dial hits ten.
