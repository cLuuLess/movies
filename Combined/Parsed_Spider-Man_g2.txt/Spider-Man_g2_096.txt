	int. control room - night

	ock starts flicking switches and reading dials, doing a
	"mission countdown" for his next experiment. this place
	has been "hot rodded" to the max.

				ock
			(reading dials and numbers)
		amperage, okay. flux, 14. negative
		variable differential... good enough.

	he shuts it down. the whine whirs down.

				ock
		okey, dokey... now all i need is parker's
		data. where the hell is weiner? damn it...
		i can't trust anybody.
			(throws his waldo in the air)
		only you, my babies... only you can i
		trust... okay... if i have to do
		everything myself... i'm going to do it.
			(to his equipment)
		i'll be back... my babies... my new
		babies!

	ock hides the waldos under his coat and leaves the room.
