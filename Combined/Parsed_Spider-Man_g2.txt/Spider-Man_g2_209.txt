	int. classroom - night

	peter pulls liz through the window. there is no time for
	an embrace.

				peter
		come on. i've found a way down.

				liz
			(at long last, love)
		i knew you were going to say that.

	they run out of the room. we pan down and see, crumpled
	beneath the window, the spider-man suit.
