               charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. she's a small 
               figure in the landscape.

               she approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding 
               procession. a young bride and groom in traditional kimono 
               walk under a parasol with their family.

               charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her 
               mother's hand. the young groom walks along with them.

               charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the 
               temple and the wedding party. her eyes well up.

                                                                    cut to:

               she walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves.

               at the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine.

               at its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces 
               of paper tied to its branches. she sees japanese people 
               writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. charlotte 
               writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.
