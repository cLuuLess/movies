                         plato's text calls this image the 
                         "paradeigma".  so the lot is the 
                         image that is your inheritance, your 
                         place on earth, all compacted into a 
                         pattern that has been selected by 
                         your soul before you even got here-
                         or better said, that is always and 
                         continually being selected by your 
                         soul,because time does not enter the 
                         equation of myth.-
