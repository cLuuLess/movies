               int. charlotte's hotel room - night

               the elaborate chiming doorbell rings.

               charlotte opens the door to see bob. he's wearing an orange 
               camouflage t-shirt. she looks at his shirt, suppressing a 
               smile.

                                     charlotte
                         you really are having a mid-life 
                         crisis.

                                     bob
                              (embarrassed)
                         i know, it's stupid.

               he goes into the bathroom to change it. he comes out with it 
               on inside out so it's just an orange t-shirt.

               he asks her to cut the label out for him. she goes to find 
               some scissors. he picks up a soul's search: finding your 
               true calling audio-book box.

                                     bob
                         a soul's search: finding your true 
                         calling - are you reading this?

                                     charlotte
                         no.

               she returns with the hotel room sewing kit.

                                     bob
                         i read it, too.

               she smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his 
               shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors.

               she slips on her shoes on to leave.

                                                                    cut to:
