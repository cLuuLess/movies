               int. bob's room - night

               bob opens the door, charlotte's standing there trying to 
               look casual, she's happy to see him (she's put some pants on 
               and flip flops instead of her dumb looking ugg boots).

               she knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes 
               in.

               bob pours some cold sake, smoothly.

               bob and charlotte watch la dolce vita with japanese subtitles 
               on the tv.

                                     bob
                         hans was very attentive to you.

                                     charlotte
                         i think he kind of liked me...is 
                         that so hard to imagine?

                                     bob
                         no, its easy.

                                     charlotte
                         how'd a japanese guy get a name like 
                         hans?

                                     bob
                         i don't know.

                                                                    cut to:

               charlotte gets up to pour more sake.

               she picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night 
               stand and reads the label : lipitor.

                                     charlotte
                         do you remember when we met at the 
                         bar? ...you were wearing a tuxedo.

                                     bob
                         but the first time i saw you was in 
                         the elevator.

                                     charlotte
                         really?

                                     bob
                         yeah, you don't remember?

               she shrugs.

                                     charlotte
                         did i scowl at you?

                                     bob
                         no, you smiled.

                                     charlotte
                         i don't remember.

                                     bob
                         i know, i kind of blend in here.

                                                                    cut to:

                         why do they switch the r's and l's 
                         here?

                                     bob (o.c.)
                         i don't know. my fax said "have a 
                         good fright".

                                     charlotte (o.c.)
                         let's never come here again, because 
                         it would never be as much fun.

                                     bob (o.c.)
                         ok, whatever you want.

                         did you see hiromix last night dancing 
                         with bambi?

                                     bob (o.c.)
                         no, i was looking at you.

                                     charlotte (o.c.)
                         oh.  well... they were dancing on 
                         the couch with that weird english 
                         guy who kept talking about hanging 
                         out with the sex pistols on kings 
                         road...

                         i got a fax today from your friend 
                         hiromix.

                                     charlotte (o.c.)
                         oh, for her show?

                                     bob (o.c.)
                         no, for a candlelight dinner, yes, 
                         for her show.

                                     charlotte (o.c.)
                         oh.

                                     bob (o.c.)
                         you're possessive.

                                     charlotte (o.s.)
                         i know.

                                                                    cut to:

                         i'm stuck. does it get easier.

                                     bob
                         no, yes, it does...

                                     charlotte
                         yeah? but look at you.

                                     bob
                         thanks. it does, the more you know 
                         who you are... you don't care about 
                         things the same way...

                                     charlotte
                         i just don't know what i'm supposed 
                         to be. i thought maybe i wanted to 
                         be a writer... but i hate what i 
                         write, and i tried taking pictures, 
                         but john's so good at that, and mine 
                         are so mediocre... and every girl 
                         goes through a photography phase, 
                         like horses, you know dumb pictures 
                         of your feet...

                                     bob
                         you'll figure it out. i'm not worried 
                         about you. keep writing.

                                     charlotte
                         but, i'm mean.

                                     bob
                         that's ok.

                                     charlotte
                         and marriage, does that get easier?

                                     bob
                         it's hard. we started going to a 
                         marriage counselor.

                                     charlotte
                         did that help? did you learn anything?

                                     bob
                         we established that we have no 
                         communication.

                                     charlotte
                         oh.

                                     bob
                         we used to have fun, she used to 
                         like to go to places with me for my 
                         movies and we would laugh at all the 
                         weirdos, but now she's tired of it 
                         all. she never wants to leave the 
                         kids, she doesn't need me, and they 
                         don't need me, i feel like i'm in 
                         the way. it gets complicated when 
                         you have kids... that changes 
                         everything.

                                     charlotte
                         that's too scary.

                                     bob
                         when they're born its like vietnam. 
                         it's terrifying.

                                     charlotte
                              (getting tired)
                         no one ever tells you that...

                                     bob
                         but, it's great being with them, 
                         after they can talk, and can do things 
                         with you.

                                     charlotte
                         that's nice. my parents were always 
                         traveling, they weren't around so 
                         much.

                                     bob
                         where'd you grow up?

                                     charlotte
                         in d.c., my dad was the ambassador 
                         to france in the eighties, so we 
                         went to school in paris for a few 
                         years... but we mostly lived in d.c., 
                         and they were never around... and 
                         then i moved to los angeles when 
                         john and i got married... it's so 
                         different there.

               they are starting to get tired.

                                     bob
                         i know.

                                     charlotte
                         john thinks i'm so snotty.

                                     bob
                         you are.

                                     charlotte
                         i know, but that's what you like 
                         about me.

               she looks over at him. he does like her.

                                     charlotte
                         why do you have to be with your 
                         opposite, why cant similar people be 
                         together?

                                     bob
                         because that would be too easy.

               they fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite 
               sides of the bed.

                                                                  fade out:
