               int. charlotte's hotel room - night

               john is sound asleep. charlotte is awake next to him. she 
               looks at the clock - it's three a.m.

               she slides close to him, kisses his mouth. he grumbles 
               something in his deep sleep, and rolls over.

               she goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment.

               she looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple. she 
               has a piece but isn't really hungry.

               she reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, 
               but she's already looked at it a few times before. she decides 
               to go downstairs.

                                                                    cut to:
