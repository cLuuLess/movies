               int. bob's hotel room - night

               bob comes back to his room. the maids have left everything 
               perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the tv has been 
               left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups 
               in nature while sad violin music plays. it's supposed to be 
               relaxing, but it's just sad.

                                                                    cut to:

               bob lies in bed. he flips through tv channels from the remote 
               control.  he passes a japanese game show, to an 80s cannon 
               ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into japanese. he 
               turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.

               he goes to the door, and opens it part way.

                                     woman (o.c.)
                              (raspy japanese voice)
                         mr. harris?

                                     bob
                         yes?

                                     woman
                         mr. kazuzo sent me.

                                     bob
                         oh?

                                     woman
                         can i enter?

               he pauses, then opens the door.

               a woman in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt 
               and stockings comes in. she is wearing '60s style make-up.

               bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her.

               bob's pov - we see her back to us as she puts a cd on the 
               stereo - it begins to play: serge gainsberg and brigitte 
               bardot sing "bonnie & clyde".  the woman turns slyly around 
               and shimmies over to bob.

                                     woman
                              (as she tries to 
                              undress him)
                         mr. harris?

                                     bob
                         yes?

                                     woman
                         do you like massage?

                                     bob
                         i don't think so.

                                     woman
                         mr. kazuzo send premium fantasy.

               she pushes him back onto the bed. he hesitates, but then 
               goes along with it passively.

                                     woman
                         my stockings.

                                     bob
                         yes?

                                     woman
                         take them.

               he fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.

                                     woman
                         no - lip  them... don't touch me!

               he takes his hands back confused.

                                     woman
                         lip my stockings! 

               he backs away, as he tries to understand her.

                                     woman
                         lip them! 

               she throws her leg up to him on the bed.

                                     bob
                         huh?

               she pantomimes ripping them. he finally understands.

                                     bob
                         oh, you want me to rip them?

               he pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just 
               snap.

               she pretends to struggle.

                                     woman
                         please let me go!

               he pulls his hands away. she grabs them and puts them back 
               on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. they wrestle around 
               awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting 
               him go. she rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake-
               defense.

                                     woman
                         let me go! 

               she pulls a confused bob down on top of her. he doesn't know 
               what she wants.

               she rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. he 
               tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. he 
               grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to 
               the floor, the room goes black.

                                     bob
                         i think you should leave.

                                                                    cut to:
