               int. hotel hallway - day

               charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door 
               and peeks in.

               a quiet group of japanese women are gathered around a table. 
               charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being 
               instructed in ikebana floral design. each woman has a little 
               vase and elegant flower cuttings. she watches as they 
               delicately arrange the tiny flowers.

               the instructor hands charlotte a vase and cuttings. alongside 
               the women, charlotte tries to follow along.
