               ext. park hyatt - night

               bob's black presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) 
               pulls up at the entrance of the park hyatt, a modern sky 
               rise.

               the automatic doors open on the car, as bob gets out.   eager 
               bellhops with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, 
               welcoming bob and helping him with his bags.

                                                                    cut to:
