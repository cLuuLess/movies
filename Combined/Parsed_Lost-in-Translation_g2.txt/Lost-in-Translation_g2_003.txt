               int. car - night

               pov from a car window - the colors and lights of tokyo neon 
               at night blur by.

                                                                    cut to:

               in the backseat of a presidential limousine, bob (late-
               forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, 
               staring out the window.

               p.o.v. from car window- we see buildings covered in bright 
               signs, a billboard of brad pitt selling jeans, another of 
               bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of 
               whiskey in a suntory ad... more signs, a huge tv with perky 
               japanese pop stars singing.

                                                                    cut to:
