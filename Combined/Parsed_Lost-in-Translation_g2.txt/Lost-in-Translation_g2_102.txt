               int. bob's room - morning

               in the harsh-morning light, bob wakes up in his bed.

               he hears the jazz singer singing in the shower "midnight at 
               the oasis".

               her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room 
               service. she seems to have taken over the whole room. he 
               wants it all to go away. she walks off to the bathroom and 
               there's a knock at the door. bob rushes to get it before she 
               can.

               he opens the door a crack, charlotte looking sweet, is 
               standing there. her hair is back in a pony-tail. bob's just 
               wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking 
               up.

                                     charlotte
                         rough night?

               he's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates 
               himself, doesn't need more help.

                                     charlotte
                         i'm going to daikanyama, do you want 
                         to come walk around?

                                     bob
                         yes, but no, i can't right now.

               the singer starts singing again in the background.

               charlotte gives bob a look.

                                     charlotte
                         oh, i guess you're busy, huh.

                                     bob
                         i don't want to be.

               he watches charlotte walk away down the beige hall.

                                                                    cut to:
