               int. photo studio - day

               bob's back is to us as a make-up artist is putting some final 
               touches on him. the photographer is giving her enthusiastic 
               direction in japanese. bob talks on his cell phone, not paying 
               attention to the make-up artist.

                                     bob
                         can you get me on a flight thursday 
                         night?

                                     elaine (o.s.)
                         we're looking into it bob, but they 
                         really want you to stay to do that 
                         talk show friday, apparently it's a 
                         really big deal, he's the johnny 
                         carson of japan.

                                     bob
                         yeah, they told me.

                                     elaine (o.s.)
                         these people are paying you a lot, 
                         do you think you could consider it?

                                     bob
                         just get me out of here as soon as 
                         you can.

                                     elaine (o.s.)
                         ok, you're scheduled to leave 
                         saturday, but we'll hold a seat 
                         thursday in case, but first class is 
                         full, you're waitlisted for an 
                         upgrade... there might be a seat on 
                         lufthansa...

                                     bob
                         oh, great. i'll talk to you later, 
                         bye.

               he hangs up. the make-up artist dusts him with powder.

               the commercial people are crowding around. bob's chair is 
               swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too 
               much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner.

               in front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted 
               and bob is handed a bottle of suntory.

               small documentary crew moves in on bob with a video camera- 
               the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty 
               dutch camera moves.

               the agency people crowd around. the photographer is excited 
               and urges bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.

                                     photographer
                         can you put hands close to face.

               the photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands 
               at his face.

                                     bob
                         urn, i don't think so. how bout i 
                         just hold the bottle.

               the photographer starts shooting. bob obviously hates the 
               whole thing, what you do for money.

                                                                    cut to:
