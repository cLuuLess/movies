               bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. 
               he tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a 
               first aid cross, but the driver doesn't understand. charlotte 
               is enjoying bob's effort.

               finally he finds a park hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel 
               number.

                                     bob

               faster, with a japanese accent. the driver nods excitedly 
               and drives off.
