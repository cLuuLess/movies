               int. nobu's compound - night

               nobu, a cool skinny stoner guy in a hawaiian shirt, plays 
               phsycadellic records in his seventies hippie surfer-pad.

               his japanese  girlfriend, who looks like a 60's pin-up,   
               pours cold sake.

               bob is  handed a ridiculously big bong.

               charlie is drunk and taking polaroids.

               nobu, really stoned, talks to bob about surfing.

               a short guy with thick glasses introduces himself to 
               charlotte, extending his hand.

                                     hans
                         i'm hans.

                                     charlotte
                         hans?  nice to meet you.

                                                                    cut to:

               charlie takes pictures of charlotte and hiromix, a sexy 
               japanese girl, posing on a sheepskin run. they are being 
               hammy for charlie who loves it.

               bob walks up and is amused watching her, she sees him and 
               gets embarrassed.

                                                                    cut to:

               decadent tokyo party - night

               hiromix dances Â— charlotte dances with hans - she looks sweaty 
               but beautiful... bob dances with his eyes closed, really 
               into it, in the midst of all of them... the song "i feel too 
               young" plays.

                                                                    cut to:
