               the fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out 
               of the hotel.

               finds bob- he's wearing a kimono and slippers. she's in boxer 
               shorts and an undershirt and slippers.

               he laughs.

               she looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel 
               slippers.

                                     charlotte
