               int. studio - day

               whiskey commercial shoot.

               the set is full of activity as the japanese crew work. bob, 
               in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a european style bar set 
               with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. a japanese girl quickly 
               powders his face as they adjust lights and the director and 
               crew speak in hurried japanese.

               the director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long 
               sentences in japanese.

               translator, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, 
               translates but it is only a short sentence now.

                                     translator
                         he wants you to turn, look in camera 
                         and say the lines.

               bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it 
               works from japanese to english.

                                     bob
                         that's all he said?

                                     translator
                         yes, turn to camera.

               bob thinks let's just get it over with.

                                     bob
                         turn left or right?

               the translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the 
               director in a japanese sentence 5 times as long. the director 
               answers her in a long excited phrase.

                                     translator
                         right side. and with intensity.

                                     bob
                         is that everything? it seemed like 
                         he was saying a lot more.

               the excited director says more in japanese. translator nods 
               in understanding. bob doesn't really know what's going on.

                                     translator
                         like an old friend, and into the 
                         camera.

                                     director
                              (to bob))
                         suntory time!

               they get ready, and roll camera:

               bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:

                                     bob
                         for relaxing times, make it suntory 
                         time.

               the director yells something about ten sentences long. the 
               translator nods.

                                     translator
                         could you do it slower, and with 
                         more intensity?

                                     bob
                         okay.

               the translator answers for him in four sentences.

               on the monitor - we see the next take: the moody lighting 
               shines on bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera 
               and gives them the line.

                                     bob
                         for relaxing times, make it suntory 
                         time.

                                                                    cut to:
