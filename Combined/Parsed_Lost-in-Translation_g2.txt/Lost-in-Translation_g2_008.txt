               bob sits at the bar. a few minutes pass as he sits in silence 
               looking around, drinking a scotch.  chet baker sings "the

               we see bob's pov of tables of people talking. japanese women 
               smoking, american businessmen tying one on, talking about 
               software sales. a waiter carefully setting down a coaster,
