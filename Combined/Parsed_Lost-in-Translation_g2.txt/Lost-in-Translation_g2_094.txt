               ext. tokyo streets - night

               bob and charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses 
               them. they don't know why, but just make their way down an 
               empty side street. little plastic cherry blossom decorations 
               hang above them.

                                     bob
                         where's your husband?

                                     charlotte
                              (like she's said it a 
                              million times)
                         working.

                                     bob
                         do you ever see him?

                                     charlotte
                              (sorta)
                         yeah.

                                     bob
                         do you know where we are?

                                     charlotte
                         no.

               she puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake 
               "one-cup". a tiny brad pitt head smiles at her next to an 
               iced coffee.

                                     charlotte
                         isn't it weird there are no street 
                         names in tokyo... you'd think a city 
                         like this would have street names... 
                         you need a map to get anywhere... 
                         look, there are no signs...

               they keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.

                                                                  fade out:
