               drunk now, as they all sing along at the chorus. women keep 
               refilling the glasses.

               that everyone knows and sings along to. charlotte and bob 
               look at each other, it is very foreign, but bob likes being 
               there with charlotte and her friends.

               she flips through a big binder of songs.

                                     charlotte
