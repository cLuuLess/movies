               int. charlotte's hotel room - afternoon

               charlotte sits on the bed talking to john who's coming out 
               of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work. he checks 
               himself in the mirror, charlotte am i shallow?

                                     john
                         no, what are you talking about.

                                     charlotte
                         i went to a temple today and i didn't 
                         feel anything.

                                     john
                         that's ok.

               he looks for his mobile phone.

                                     charlotte
                         i don't know what to do.

                                     john
                         that's ok, you'll figure it out.

               he comes close and kisses her.

                                     charlotte
                         you smell weird.

                                     john
                         what?

               she leans back to look at him.

                                     charlotte
                         like popcorn?

                                     john
                         i got some hair stuff.

               she looks at him funny.

                                     charlotte
                         hair stuff?

                                     john
                         i gotta go to work.

               he grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when 
               his cell phone rings.

                                     john
                         i'll be right down...i'm just 
                         leaving...ok.

               he kisses her, and leaves.

                                     john
                         see you later.

                                     charlotte
                         bye.

                                                                    cut to:

               she makes a call. we see her back and hair, as she looks out 
               the bright window.

                                     charlotte
                         lauren?

                                     charlotte

                         went to a shrine today and all these

                         i didn't feel anything... i even

               lauren's call-waiting beeps, cutting off her sentence.

                                     lauren
                         oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?

                                     charlotte

               charlotte waits.

                                     lauren
                         sorry about that, what were you 
                         saying?

               in the background a baby starts crying.

                                     charlotte
                         oh, it's nothing... i better go,

                         you don't have any kids yet and you 
                         can go off to japan... call me when

                         ok, bye.

               she hangs up. she sits there for a moment, starting to cry, 
               she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away.

                                                                    cut to:
