               int. charlotte's hotel room - night

               charlotte lies in bed awake. the clock says its 4 a.m.

               finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light 
               on. in john's old t-shirt and ugg boots, she goes to the 
               couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate 
               presentation left by the hotel.

               she picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a 
               few times before. she hears something and goes over to the 
               door. on her way, she passes her red t. anthony suitcase 
               overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in 
               it.

               a hotel message envelope is slipped under the door. she opens 
               it to see a typed note from the operator:

               "from: mr. harris. message: are you awake?"

               she smiles like she's gotten a valentine.

                                                                    cut to:
