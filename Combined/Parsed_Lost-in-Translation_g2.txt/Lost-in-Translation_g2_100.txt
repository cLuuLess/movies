               int. car - night

               bob rides in the back of the presidential, looking out the 
               window at the city.

               he pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it. it's 
               charlotte, peering over her shoulder with a little smile, 
               from their sake-drenched night at nobu's compound.
