               int. park hyatt bar - night

               at a corner table charlotte sits with john, kelly, and dj 
               clean, a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in japan.

               charlotte is bored while kelly talks on.

               sausalito performs in the background.

                                     kelly
                         ...my dad was anorexic.

                                     charlotte
                         (she's never heard of that)
                         really?

               john shoots charlotte a look.

                                     kelly
                              (very serious)
                         he was on the american side at the 
                         bay of pigs, in cuba, and he was 
                         taken prisoner, and they tortured 
                         them about their food the whole time.

                                     benzo
                         where?

                                     kelly
                         my dad fought on the american side 
                         at the bay of pigs. so, when he was 
                         a prisoner, they would tell them 
                         they had put poison in their food 
                         and they would make themselves throw 
                         up... and when he got back, he did 
                         better, but he still has food issues. 
                         he has to have really clean food.  
                         and really simple. he can't just go 
                         have, say, chinese food.

                                     john
                              (trying)
                         oh, that's too bad.

               charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she 
               watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a waiter.

                                     benzo
                              (nodding at the view)
                         how crazy is this shit?

                                     charlotte
                         yeah, it is.

               dj clean starts doing a human beat box at her.

               charlotte looks over at kelly.

                                     kelly
                         ...oh my god you have to try it, 
                         this power cleanse is amazing- it's 
                         lemon juice and grade b maple syrup 
                         and cayenne pepper for seven days. 
                         just like a half a teaspoon of 
                         cayenne. the first few days you're a 
                         little scattered, but by day four - 
                         it's amazing... my eyes were so 
                         white...

               charlotte excuses herself.

               she passes bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she 
               is leaving.

                                     charlotte
                         hi again, how's it going?

                                     bob
                         who do i have to fuck to get off 
                         this planet?

               charlotte laughs with sympathy, but doesn't know what to 
               tell him.

                                                                    cut to:
