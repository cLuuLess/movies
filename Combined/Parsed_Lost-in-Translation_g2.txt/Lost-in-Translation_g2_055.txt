               int. tokyo bar - night

               all white nightclub, lit with black lights so it seems to 
               glow in the dark, with the booming sound of helicopters. 
               japanese gallager brothers walk by.

               bob watches charlotte as charlie, in a crazy outfit, hugs 
               her.  charlotte tries to talk to bob over the loud music.

                                     charlotte
                         charlie, this is bob. bob Â— charlie 
                         brown.

                                     bob
                         hi, charlie.

               they shake hands.

                                     charlotte
                         his real name's hayashi, but someone 
                         started calling him charlie because 
                         they thought he looked like charlie 
                         brown. they've all got american 
                         nicknames because its easier for me 
                         to remember... they were just out in 
                         l.a. last month doing a shoot with 
                         john... that guy's mr.valentine, 
                         he's the art director of their 
                         magazine, i don't even know his real 
                         name, or why i call him that.

               bob looks over at some skinny guy in huge glasses smiling at 
               them. charlie hands them some drinks.

                                     charlie
                         this is bambi.

                                     charlotte
                         hi.

               a young shy guy with a shaved head smiles at her, and takes 
               her picture.

               a japanese kraftwerk cover-band plays trans europa express.

               some people at the bar buy drinks for bob and insist on 
               drinking with him.

               bob and charlotte look over as charlie gets into some problem 
               with the bartender.  the bartender gets mad and starts 
               shooting a real-looking bb gun at him. orange bullets fly 
               through the air. they all rush out of there.

                                                                    cut to:
