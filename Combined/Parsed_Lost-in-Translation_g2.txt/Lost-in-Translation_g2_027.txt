               int. hotel lobby - day

               the hotel is filled with business people. a dressed up family 
               is going to lunch. we follow a jet-lagged charlotte and john, 
               as they walk down the lobby hall.

               an energetic blonde actress, kelly, pops up to them. (she's 
               carrying a copy of memoirs of a geisha.)

               john, who was holding charlotte's hand, drops it.

                                     kelly
                         john! what are you doing here?

                                     john
                         i'm just here shooting this band, 
                         what about you?

                                     kelly
                         promoting that action movie i did...

               she does a karate chop and laughs.

                                     kelly
                         ...doing like twenty million 
                         interviews a day... it's soo good to 
                         see you. how long are you here for?

                                     john
                         we're here for the week. i'm shooting 
                         in osaka for a few days.

                                     kelly
                         it's amazing  there!

                                     john
                         have you met charlotte? my wife.

                                     kelly
                         no!  hi! so great to meet you!

                                     charlotte
                         hi, nice to meet you.

                                     kelly
                         you know, john, you're my favorite 
                         photographer, i only want to be shot 
                         by you.

               charlotte looks at john.

                                     john
                         uh..thanks.

                                     kelly
                              (as she fans out her 
                              top)
                         sorry if i have the worst b.o., i've 
                         been sweating in this little room 
                         with t.v. lights for hours...

               kelly, giggling and acting all too comfortable with herself, 
               is eating up all the oxygen around them.

                                     john
                         oh no...

                                     kelly
                              (with a big smile)
                         ...well, i have the worst  headache, 
                         i have to go find some aspirin. but, 
                         call me, let's have a drink, i'm 
                         under evelyn waugh.

               kelly giggles. charlotte smirks.

                                     john
                         ok, see you later.

               and kelly and her make-up artist and publicist are off. john 
               and charlotte continue.

                                     charlotte
                         evelyn waugh?

                                     john
                         what?

                                     charlotte
                         evelyn waugh was a man.

               john shrugs.

                                     john
                         oh, c'mon, she's nice.  not everyone 
                         went to yale.

               charlotte shoots him a look.

                                     john
                         its just a pseudonym, it doesn't 
                         matter.

                                     charlotte
                         why do you have to defend her?

                                     john
                         i'm not, but do you have to point 
                         out how stupid everyone is.

                                     charlotte
                         no, i thought it was funny. forget 
                         it.

               his producer comes up to them. john puts his arm around 
               charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine.

                                     producer
                              (looks at his watch)
                         we should get going.

                                     john
                         ok, i'll see you later.

               he kisses her on the cheek, and is gone.

                                                                    cut to:
