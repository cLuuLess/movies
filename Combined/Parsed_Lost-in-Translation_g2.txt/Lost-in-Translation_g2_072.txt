               they sit in the bright light. she squints and drinks a bloody 
               mary. bob is distant.

               she looks across at two middle-aged mid-western women talking 
               about plastic surgery, you can't hear them, but can tell as 
               they gesture and one pulls her eye lids up.

               charlotte looks at another table by the elaborate buffet and 
               sees the redhead singer having breakfast with the rest of 
               sausalito.

                         i see them every morning.

               they don't know what to say. somehow it's too intimate having 
               breakfast. she eats her breakfast aware of her every movement.

               c.u. - her pov of soft scrambled eggs.

                                                                    cut to:
