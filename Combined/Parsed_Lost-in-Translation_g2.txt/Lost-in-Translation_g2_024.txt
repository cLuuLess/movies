               charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood 
               filled with neon, ads, and people.

               she looks up at the huge intersection as tons of japanese 
               people wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until 
               the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross.

               a tv screen covering a building plays commercials.

               she roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish 
               japanese kids, tan schoolgirls pass her.

                                                                    cut to:

               charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around.

               on a small side street she stops at a little park. she watches 
               a japanese man and woman together:

               charlotte's pov -

               c.u. the man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's 
               neck, and leans in close. the woman smiles at him, in love.
