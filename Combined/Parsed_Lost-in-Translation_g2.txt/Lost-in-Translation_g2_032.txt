               int. hotel - day

               charlotte follows a japanese family in formal dress out of 
               the elevator onto the mezzanine level. she wanders down a 
               big hall.

               she sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which 
               is in the midst of a press conference. cameras flash as kelly, 
               with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions 
               enthusiastically.

               kelly you know, barbecuing, and yoga, and i love taking my 
               dogs, buster and lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was 
               great learning karate for "midnight racer" - i did all my 
               own stunts!

               the japanese journalists seem excited by her answer.

               kelly throws a karate punch for a photographer.

                                     sweaty journalist
                         what was it like working with keanu 
                         reeves?

                                     kelly
                         it was great. i've known him for a 
                         while now- you know we both live in 
                         l.a. we both have dogs...
