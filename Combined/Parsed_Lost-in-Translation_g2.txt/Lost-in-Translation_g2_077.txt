               int. bob's hotel room - day

               bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his 
               stubble and sees that it's turning grey.

               he opens the hotel shaving kit. he squirts shaving cream 
               from the child-size can. even the razor is small. he covers 
               his face with shaving cream when the phone rings.

                                     bob
                         hello?
