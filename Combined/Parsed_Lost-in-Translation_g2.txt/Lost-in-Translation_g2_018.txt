               int. park hyatt bar - night

               bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits 
               alone having a drink. a jazz band from sausalito performs. 
               the singer is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed 
               in red, and takes her singing very seriously. she sings a 
               slow version of "parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme".

               c.u. - a golden beer is poured very slowly.

               bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away.

               across the bar, charlotte sits with john, her husband (he is 
               in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and 
               some friends - super stylish, weird japanese fashion people 
               (all smoking). one of them, charlie, in a shiny suit, keeps 
               taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts.

                                     jazz singer
                         thank you. we're glad to be here, 
                         we're sausalito.

               charlotte laughs and looks down, the japanese audience clap 
               very seriously... she and bob catch eyes - about sausalito 
               and how weird it is there.

                                                                    cut to:
