               int. elevator - night

               bob and charlotte, drunk in the elevator.

                                     charlotte
                         54?

               he nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself.

               they look at each other across the empty elevator, both 
               leaning against the walls.

               the elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. 
               they kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to 
               their mouths. the door shuts- he missed his floor.

               the elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. they kiss 
               good-night again and she gets out before the door closes.

               he watches the door close on her as she makes her way down 
               the long beige hall.

                                                                  fade out:
