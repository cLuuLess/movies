               int. park hyatt lobby - night

               as they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. 
               it's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and 
               just a sleeping man sits in the back of the lounge, and a 
               snuggled up romantic japanese couple sit close to: kelly, 
               the blonde actress, singing to them.

               she stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "nobody 
               does it better" with all her heart.

               bob and charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying 
               to be invisible).


               fade in:
