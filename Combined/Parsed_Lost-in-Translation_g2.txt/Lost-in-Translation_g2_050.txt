               int. charlotte's hotel room - late afternoon

               51c.u. charlotte's lips. she puts watermelon color lipstick 
               on.she looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear.

                                                                    cut to:

               we hear the shower running in the bathroom.

               charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry 
               blossom decorations.

               she goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she 
               flops down.

                                     charlotte
                         ouch.

               she holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness.

               john talks to her from the shower.

                                     john (o.c.)
                         at the fitting, they had all these 
                         rock n roll clothes, the label guys 
                         kept saying lock n loll, though, but 
                         the band doesn't look tough at 
                         all...they look better just skinny 
                         and nerdy, like how when they came 
                         in...they looked so uncomfortable in 
                         these keith richards clothes, they 
                         should just be like they are, don't 
                         you think?

               she's drifted off.

                                     charlotte
                         yeah.

                                     john
                         yeah, i think you're probably right... 
                         because when you try to...

               he gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. 
               charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear.

               she tries her scarf on that she's been knitting.

                                     charlotte
                         do you think it's done?

                                     john
                         i don't know.

               he goes to get all his stuff together.

               he passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it.

                                     john
                         will you please stop smoking?

                                     charlotte
                         but i like to... and i don't smoke 
                         that much.

                                     john
                         its bad for you.

                                     charlotte
                         ok, i will... later.

               he picks up a camera from a table in the corner. he looks at 
               the self-help audio book box.

                                     john
                         a soul's search: finding your true 
                         character and calling? is this yours?

                                     charlotte
                         oh... that's nothing, someone gave 
                         it to me.

                                     john
                         you don't have to be embarrassed.

                                     charlotte
                         i'm not. it's just corny, but i'm 
                         not into it.

                                     john
                         it's ok if you are.

               he kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute 
               pet, and then continues getting his stuff together.

               john sets two bottles of cristal on the bed next to her, not 
               really seeing her.

                                     john
                         oh, the record company sent these...

                                     charlotte
                         mmm, i love cristal, let's have some.

                                     john
                         i gotta go... and i don't really 
                         like champagne.

               as he unplugs his cell phone from the wall.

                                     john
                         are you sure you want to stay?

                                     charlotte
                         are you sure you have to go?

               he looks at her - like don't make it harder.

                                     charlotte
                         yeah, i know you have to work the 
                         whole time, i'll probably have more 
                         fun here. i'll call charlie and those 
                         guys.

                                     john
                         ok, definitely call them, i'll be 
                         back friday. i love you.

               they kiss.

                                     charlotte
                         i love you.

               he tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, 
               tickling her in a burst of affection. she laughs, her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     charlotte
                         i miss you.

                                     john
                         it'll just be a few days.

               he kisses her and is off.

               charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of 
               champagne.

                                                                    cut to:
