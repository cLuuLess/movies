               int. shabu shabu restaurant - day

               bob and charlotte are seated at a big booth in a corny shabu 
               shabu restaurant.

                                     charlotte
                         the jazz singer? the red-head?

               bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.

                                     charlotte
                         well, i guess she's more around your 
                         age...  you guys could talk about 
                         things in common, like growing up in 
                         the fifties.

                                     bob
                         you're a brat, wasn't there anyone 
                         else around to lavish you with 
                         attention?

               she scowls at him.

               the waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and 
               turns on a pot on the table to cook their food.

               charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of 
               different trays of meat. the waitress doesn't speak english.

                                     charlotte
                         i can't tell the difference?

               they have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the 
               menu.

                                     bob
                         we'll have two of these.

               he makes some small talk, she is bugged.

                                     bob
                         what do you want to drink?

                                     charlotte
                         a coke.

               he orders the drinks.

                                     bob
                         so, where'd you go today.

                                     charlotte
                         around.

               "this is the end" by the doors starts playing on the stereo. 
               the waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef. steam 
               rises from the pot on the table.

               the song ends, and another doors song comes on.

                                     charlotte
                         they're not going to play the whole 
                         album, are they?

               they look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each 
               other- the whole thing is awful.

                                                                  fade out:
