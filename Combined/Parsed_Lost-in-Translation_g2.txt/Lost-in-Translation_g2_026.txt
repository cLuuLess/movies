               int. park hyatt bar - night

               bob sits alone at the bar. charlotte sits down a seat away 
               from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he 
               turns and finds her next to him. they look at each other. a 
               young bartender with a sweet face tends to them.

                                     bartender
                         what can i get you?

                                     charlotte
                         i'm not sure.

                                     bob
                              (line from commercial)

                                     bob & bartender
                         'suntory time'!

               charlotte smiles at him sympathetically

                                     charlotte
                         what are you doing here?

                                     bob
                         my wife needs space, i don't know my 
                         kids ' birthdays.  everyone wants 
                         tiger woods, but they could get me, 
                         so i'm here doing a whiskey 
                         commercial.

               she looks at him.

                                     charlotte
                         oh.

               she lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her.

                                     charlotte
                         i'll just have a beer.

               he makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and 
               jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days.

                                     bob
                         what about you? why are you here?

                                     charlotte
                         my husband's here for work-he's a 
                         photographer- and i just came 
                         along...i'm not really doing anything 
                         right now, and we have some friends 
                         who live here.

                                     bob
                         how long have you been married?

                                     charlotte

                                     charlotte
                         you're probably just having a mid-
                         life crisis. did you buy a porche?

                                     bob
                         i'm thinking about it.

                                     charlotte
                         25 years... that's a long time... 
                         are you still in love with your wife?

                                     bob
                         yes... i don't know, i don't know 
                         her anymore. i don't know if you can 
                         be in love with one person the whole 
                         time. i was... actually i was in 
                         love with her sister first, when i 
                         was twenty-one. and one day her sister 
                         said to me she wanted to move to 
                         paris, so i said okay, and she said 
                         no, she wanted to move to paris with 
                         francois,   and she's still married 
                         to him. and i moved in with lydia... 
                         but i always really liked lydia.

                                     charlotte
                         i don't know, but i can think about 
                         it, a lot.

                                     bob
                         it takes a while to figure it out. 
                         i'm sure you will, though.

                                     charlotte
                         thanks. i'm sure your mid-life crisis 
                         will work out,too.
