               int. hotel elevator - day

               bob gets into the ded elevator. he is stopped momentarily by 
               the concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his 
               stay.

               in the elevator bob's surrounded by japanese businesspeople 
               and a family dressed for a wedding.

               across, at the other side of the elevator he sees charlotte, 
               a pretty ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only 
               other westerner in the elevator. her honey-colored hair stands 
               out in the crowd.

               she's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in 
               the elevator, but the japanese look straight ahead at the 
               elevator doors.

               charlotte and bob look at each other across the japanese 
               heads. she smiles, from one foreigner to another. the door 
               opens and she gets out with the crowd. bob watches her leave.
