               int. orange nightclub - night

               lights strobe and peaches' seedy "fuck the pain away" booms 
               through the speakers.

               tan japanese strippers with platinum hair dance and hang 
               from a pole on a little platform.

               bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of 
               place and empty.

               he looks over at a table of young american investment brokers. 
               he wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable.

               charlotte shows up with charlie and the other guys. she sits 
               down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill 
               me?' look.

                                     charlotte
                         how long have you been here?

               he looks at her like it's been forever. she smiles for 
               forgiveness.

               they look over and see a weird guy in the corner getting a 
               lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the 
               place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it.

               through a beaded curtain, charlie and bambi get lap dances 
               in a dark corner of pillows.

               charlotte looks at bob.

                                     charlotte
                         c'mon, let's go.

                                                                    cut to:
