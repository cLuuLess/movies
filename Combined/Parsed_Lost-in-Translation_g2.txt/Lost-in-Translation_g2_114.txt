               int. car - day

               in the backseat, bob leans back on the little doily.

               the car pulls away.

               around the corner, he looks down a crowded alley and sees 
               charlotte's blonde hair.

                                     bob
                         can you pull over a second?

               the driver, wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over 
               slowly. bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has 
               to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly).
