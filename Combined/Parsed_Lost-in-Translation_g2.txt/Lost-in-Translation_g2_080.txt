               he walks down a little street in a more old-fashioned 
               neighborhood. he's wearing new techno sneakers. he makes a 
               call on his cell phone.

                                     bob
                         miss kawasaki? it's bob harris...

                         yes, i'd love to stay to be on his 
                         talk show... sure.. ok... bye.

               a light rain starts as he looks at a fax from charlotte with 
               a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there 
               are no street signs.

               ext/int. ichican sushi - day

               bob finally finds the small restaurant. the automatic door 
               opens for him, and charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby 
               sushi chef, turns to bob happy to see him. he is disheveled 
               from the rain and adorable.

               he sits down next to charlotte, she pours him a beer and 
               orders for him.

                                     charlotte
                         you made it.

                                     bob
                         they really have to work on that 
                         street name thing.

               a perky recording voice says "kornichiwa!" from his pocket.

                                     charlotte
                         what's that?

               he pulls a pink hello kitty watch from his pocket.

                                     bob
                         it's for my daughter.

                                     charlotte
                         how old is she?

                                     bob
                         four.

                                     charlotte
                         oh, she'll love it.

               the sushi chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a 
               banana leaf.

               charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so 
               she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. 
               bob makes fun of her gracelessness.

                                     bob
                         nice one.

                                     charlotte
                              (mouth full)
                         fuck off.

               they have lunch, he makes her laugh.

               he looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.

                                     bob
                         what happened to your toe?

                                     charlotte
                         i don't know, i think maybe i broke 
                         it? i knocked into something the 
                         other day...

               she slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe 
               is black and blue.

                                     bob
                         that doesn't look good.

               she enjoys the sympathy.

                                     charlotte
                         it's bad isn't it?

                                     bob
                         we should get you to the doctor.

                                     charlotte
                         you think so?

                                     bob
                         yeah, look at that thing.

               she smiles at him.

                                                                    cut to:
