               int. hotel reception -day

               bob with his bags tries to call again. the commercial people 
               and hotel staff crowd around to help him, asking about his 
               stay.

                                     bob
                         charlotte?

                                     charlotte
                         hi, bob.

                                     bob
                         i'm just leaving.... do you have my 
                         jacket?

                                     charlotte
                         uh, yeah... i'll bring it down.

                                     bob

                                     charlott
                         e ok, see you in a second.

               a member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little 
               silver tray.

               miss kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in 
               traditional japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do 
               with them and has to carry them.

               the executive woman from the bar walks up to him. he hangs 
               up the phone.

                                     bob
                         0hr hi.

                                     exec woman
                         you're leaving?

               she looks at him like, we could have had some fun.

                                     bob
                         yeah, yeah, i'm going.

               he sees charlotte come out of the elevator.

                                     bob
                         i have to go, thanks, bye.

               he rushes over to charlotte. she looks at his bag.

                                     charlotte
                         just saying good-bye to everyone 
                         before you leave?

                                     bob
                         yes, no.

               she hands him his jacket.

                                     bob
                         thanks.

               she waits for him to say something more. he wants to tell 
               her he loves her, that she should come with him.

                                     charlotte
                         that's it?

               the concierge tells him his car is here.

                                     charlotte
                         you're leaving right now?

                                     bob
                         yes.

                                     charlotte
                         well... have a good flight.

                                     bob
                         thanks.

                                     charlotte
                              (hurt)
                         ok, bye.

               she walks away.

               a hotel manager asks bob about his luggage, another asks if 
               he had a pleasant stay. charlotte gets in the elevator to go 
               out, the doors close on her back.

                                                                    cut to:
