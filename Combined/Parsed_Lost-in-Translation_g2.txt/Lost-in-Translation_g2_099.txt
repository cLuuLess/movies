               int. t.v. studio - day

               exciting music plays as the talk/game show starts.

               bob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the host.

                                     tv host
                              (in japanese)
                         we hear you're quite a golfer.

               a translator translates.

                                     bob
                              (nodding)
                         i enjoy the sport.

               the translator translates - four sentences longer and with 
               added enthusiasm.

               after a few questions the host excitedly announces something 
               to the audience in japanese. they scream, the lights flash, 
               bob has no idea what's going on.

               a cloud of smoke reveals the iron chef, with feathered hair, 
               wearing an 18th century waistcoat.  a large red chef hat is 
               placed on bob's head.

                                     translator
                         they now have the competition for 
                         you with the iron chef.

               bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now 
               bob and the iron chef are at dueling counters. the host barks 
               instructions in japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal 
               lobster on it is tied around bob, the crowd cheers - there's 
               no way out.

                                                                    cut to:
