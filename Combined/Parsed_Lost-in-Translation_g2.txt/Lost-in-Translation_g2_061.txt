               int. karaoke bar hallway - night

               taking a break from the crowded and hot karaoke room, 
               charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright 
               hallway. it is quiet with just the muffled sound of music 
               from the karaoke room. she's wearing a pink geisha wig. bob 
               sits down next to her.

               charlotte lights his cigarette with some crazy japanese light-
               up lighter.

               she leans her head back - it's getting too heavy.

               she looks at his hands.

                                     charlotte
                         you bite your nails?

               he nods.

                                     charlotte
                         i could cut the ones that are left 
                         for you.

                                     bob
                         ok.

                                                                    cut to:
