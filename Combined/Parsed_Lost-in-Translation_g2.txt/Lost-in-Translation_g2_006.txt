               he doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his 
               pocket.

               the commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him 
               up, and ask if he needs anything else.

               some japanese rock stars with shag haircuts and skinny leather 
               pants pass by. each commercial person has to shake bob's 
               hand before leaving.
