               an olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls with the tokyo 
               view. bob is handed a swim cap and goggles.

               bob watches a japanese businessman swimming, he looks like 
               an over-grown baby.

               bob swims laps in the pristine pool.

               he continues his laps. under water he sees the jumping legs 
               of middle-aged women.

               a disco mixed tape starts, and above water we see a western 
               instructor in tight shorts leading an aqua-aerobics class to 
               the group of women, they jump up and down to sister sledge.
