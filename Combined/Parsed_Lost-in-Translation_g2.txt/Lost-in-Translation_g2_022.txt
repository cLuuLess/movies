               int. hotel gym - night

               the gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. bob passes 
               piles of little towels and bottles of water. he takes a water 
               for his workout.

               he approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the 
               drink holder of the machine. he looks at the lit-up 
               instruction panel'99 it is all in japanese.

               he pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a 
               soothing woman's voice recites instructions in japanese.

               he gets on it, and sinks. he tries to make the arms and foot 
               peddles coordinate. he pushes a button and it starts moving 
               too fast. in an upward rotation he tries to reach the control 
               panel, but is not fast enough. the soothing woman's voice 
               continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an english 
               word- gently,   gently...vigorous)   he tries to keep up 
               with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it 
               down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards 
               instead.

                                                                    cut to:
