               int. hotel spa bath - evening

               bob reclines in the big japanese wooden tub, steam rises as 
               he is turning red. his phone rings. he dries his hands quickly 
               to reach it before it stops ringing.

                                     bob
                         hello?

                         bob?

                                     bob
                         hi, lydia.

                         you... did you get the carpet samples?

                         ok, whatever you think... i'm lost.

                                     lydia (o.s.)
                         it's just carpet.

                                     bob
                         that's not what i'm talking about.
