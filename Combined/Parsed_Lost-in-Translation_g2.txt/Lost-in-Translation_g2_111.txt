               a sexy executive woman asks bob for a light. he looks at her 
               great legs as he lights her cigarette. he looks around, 
               keeping an eye out for charlotte. the group of commercial 
               people arrive to see him off.

               he excuses himself for a moment and goes to a phone on a 
               little table in the corner.

               bob picks up the house phone.
