               bob looks around at all the japanese gift stuff, and buys a 
               little stuffed bunny. his phone rings as he's paying for it.

                                     bob
                         hello?

                         bob, it's me.

                                     bob
                         oh, hi, elaine.

                         so, we got you on an earlier flight, 
                         but i really think you should think 
                         about staying for that talk show.

                         ok.

                                     elaine (o.s.)
                         you'll do it?

                                     bob
                         yeah, i'll stay.

                                                                    cut to:
