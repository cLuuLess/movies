               int. bob's room - evening

               as bob opens his door to his room, a fedex package falls in 
               his path.

               he opens it - large carpet swatches fall out with a note

               "bob - which one do you want for your study? i like the 
               burgundy, but whatever you want. love, l"

               he looks at them for a second, they all look the same, and 
               why is she sending these? he puts them down.

                                                                    cut to:
