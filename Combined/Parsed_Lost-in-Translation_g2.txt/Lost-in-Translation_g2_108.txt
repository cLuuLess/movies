               int. park hyatt bar - night

               and charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual 
               spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake. she 
               lights two cigarettes and passes one to him.

               a new jazz band is now playing. the singer is full of 
               enthusiasm as they start their stint at the park hyatt.

                                     new singer
                         good evening. i'm carl west, and 
                         we're thrilled to be joining you 
                         this week, here at the ny bar in 
                         shinjuku.

               he sings "where or when" with all his heart.

               now, old-timers there, bob and charlotte look at each other 
               and chuckle.

                                     singer
                         jt seems we stood and talked like  
                         this before,   we looked at  each 
                         other in  the same way thenr   but  
                         i cant remember where or when...

               bob and charlotte sit there together.

                                     bob
                         i don't want to go back tomorrow.

                                     charlotte
                         i know. but, it doesn't last, you 
                         have to go back sometime.

                                     bob
                         why can't it last?

                                     charlotte
                         i don't know, it just doesn't, reality 
                         changes things....we can't stay here 
                         forever, unless maybe we started a 
                         jazz band.

               (alt charlotte dialog: i don't know it just doesn't, reality 
               changes things...and we can't stay here forever)

               he looks over at her.

               the singer continues where or when, as they sit there 
               together, the view sparkling.

                                     singer (o.c.)
                         somethings  that happen for the first 
                         time,   seem to be happening again 
                         and so it  seems we have met before,   
                         and laughed before,   and loved 
                         before,   but who knows where or 
                         when...

                                                                    cut to:
