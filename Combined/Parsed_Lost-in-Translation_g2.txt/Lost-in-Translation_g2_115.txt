               ext. tokyo streets - day

               bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw 
               charlotte. the street is crowded with japanese people, and 
               different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light 
               rain).

               music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some 
               promo going on with girls handing out little cologne samples. 
               bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, 
               and super tan japanese kids.

               in the distance an umbrella moves to reveal charlotte.

                                     bob
                         charlotte!

               but she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. he rushes to 
               her.

               c.u. she turns and we see she is crying.

               the music swells. he embraces her, holding her close to him 
               in the crowd.

                                     bob
                         why are you crying?

                                     charlotte
                              (sincere)
                         i'll miss you.

               he kisses her, hugs her good-bye.

                                     bob
                         i know, i'm going to miss you, too.

               he holds her close.

                                                                    cut to:

               charlotte watches bob as he reaches his car, he turns and 
               looks at her.

               she smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.

               bob gets into his car.

                                                                    cut to:

               charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way.

                                                                    cut to:
