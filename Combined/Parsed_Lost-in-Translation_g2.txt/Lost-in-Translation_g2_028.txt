                         dinner and she was telling me about 
                         her daughter who had this awful 
                         boyfriend and a messy break-up and 
                         how hard it is,and now she's single 
                         and wants to start a family, i'm so 
                         glad that you're settled, and not in 
                         that situation.  anyway, call me

                         whether we want to go skiing or. 
                         daddy wants to stay home and have it 
                         here, which might be easier with 
                         lauren and the children, but let me
