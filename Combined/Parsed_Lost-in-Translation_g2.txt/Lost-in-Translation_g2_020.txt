               int. charlotte's hotel room - night

               charlotte lays close to her young husband, john. she looks 
               to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly. she leans 
               her chin on his shoulder.

                                     charlotte
                         are you awake?

               he doesn't answer.

                                     charlotte
                         john?

               he grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, 
               and grabs her under the covers. he kisses her.

                                     john
                         go to sleep.

               he holds her close, but she can't sleep.

                                                                    cut to:

               charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings. 
               the sun is starting to come up. below she watches cars going 
               places.

                                                                    cut to:
