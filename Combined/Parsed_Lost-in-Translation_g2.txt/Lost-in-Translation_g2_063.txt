               int. nobu's entry - night

               bob and charlotte are leaving nobu's. she's wearing bob's 
               jacket.

                                     charlie
                         make sure she gets home okay?

                                     bob
                         i will.

               bob takes charlotte's arm carefully just as she bangs her 
               head walking into the glass door - it makes a loud thud.

                                     bob
                         are you ok?

               she nods. bob looks back at charlie who is watching- she's 
               fine.

               he leads her into a waiting cab.

                                                                    cut to:
