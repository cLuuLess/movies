57	ext -- license plate factory -- day (1949) 57

	a tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. two cons dip up a bucket of
	tar and tie a rope to the handle. the rope goes taught. camera
	follows the bucket of tar up the side of the building to -- 

58 	the roof 58

	-- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping
	big padd brushes and spreading the tar. anglz over to byron 
	hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: 

				hadley 
		...so this shithead lawyer calls 
		long distance from texas, and he 
		says, byron hadley? i say, yeah. he 
		says, sorry to inform you, but your 
		brother just died. 

				youngblood 
		damn, byron. sorry to hear that. 

				hadley 
		i ain't. he was an asshole. run off 
		years ago, family ain't heard of him 
		since. figured him for dead anyway. 
		so this lawyer prick says, your 
		brother died a rich man. oil wells 
		and shit, close to a million bucks. 
		jesus, it's frigging incredible how 
		lucky some assholes can get. 

				trout 
		a million bucks? jeez-louise! you 
		get any of that? 

				hadley 
		thirty five thousand. that's what 
		he left me. 

				trout 
		dollars? holy shit, that's great! 
		like winnin' a lottery... 
			(off hadley's shitty look) 
		...ain't it? 

				hadley 
		dumbshit. what do you figger the 
		government's gonna do to me? take a 
		big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 

				trout 
		oh. hadn't thought of that. 

				hadley 
		maybe leave me enough to buy a new 
		car with. then what happens? you 
		pay tax on the car. repairs and 
		maintenance. goddamn kids pesterin' 
		you to take 'em for a ride... 

				mert 
		and drive it, if they're old enough. 

				hadley 
		that's right, wanting to drive it, 
		wanting to learn on it, f'chrissake! 
		then at the end of the year, if you 
		figured the tax wrong, they make 
		you pay out of your own pocket. 
		uncle sam puts his hand in your 
		shirt and squeezes your tit till 
		it's purple. always get the short 
		end. that's a fact. 
			(spits over the side) 
		some brother. shit. 

	the prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. 

				heywood 
		poor byron. what terrible fuckin' 
		luck. imagine inheriting thirty 
		five thousand dollars. 

				red 
		crying shame. some folks got it 
		awful bad. 

	red glances over -- and is shocked to see andy standing up,
	listening to the guards talk. 

				red 
		hey, you nuts? keep your eyes on 
		your pail! 

	andy tosses his padd in the bucket and strolls toward hadley.

				red 
		andy! come back! shit! 

				snooze 
		what's he doing? 

				floyd 
		gettin' himself killed. 

				red 
		god damn it... 

				heywood 
		just keep spreadin' tar... 

	the guards stiffen at andy's approach. youngblood's hand goes
	to his holster. the tower guards click-clack their rifle 
	bolts. hadley turns, stupefied to find andy there. 

				andy 
		mr. hadley. do you trust your wife? 

				hadley 
		that's funny. you're gonna look 
		funnier suckin' my dick with no 
		fuckin' teeth. 

				andy 
		what i mean is, do you think she'd 
		go behind your back? try to 
		hamstring you? 

				hadley 
		that's it! step aside, mert. this 
		fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 

	hadley grabs andy's collar and propels him violently toward
	the edge of the roof. the cons furiously keep spreading tar.

				heywood 
		oh god, he's gonna do it, he's 
		gonna throw him off the roof... 

				snooze 
		oh shit, oh fuck, oh jesus... 

				andy 
		because if you do trust her, there's 
		no reason in the world you can't 
		keep every cent of that money. 

	hadley abruptly jerks andy to a stop right at the edge. in 
	fact, andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 
	scraping the roof. the only thing between him and an ugly drop
	to the concrete is hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.

				hadley 
		you better start making sense. 

				andy 
		if you want to keep that money, all 
		of it, just give it to your wife. 
		see, the irs allows you a one-time- 
		only gift to your spouse. it's good 
		up to sixty thousand dollars. 

				hadley 
		naw, that ain't right! tax free? 

				andy 
		tax free. irs can't touch one cent. 

	the cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.

				hadley 
		you're the smart banker what shot 
		his wife. why should i believe a 
		smart banker like you? so's i can 
		wind up in here with you? 

				andy 
		it's perfectly legal. go ask the 
		irs, they'll say the same thing. 
		actually, i feel silly telling you 
		all this. i'm sure you would have 
		investigated the matter yourself. 

				hadley 
		fuckin'-a. i don't need no smart 
		wife-killin' banker to show me where 
		the bear shit in the buckwheat. 

				andy 
		of course not. but you will need 
		somebody to set up the tax-free 
		gift, and that'll cost you. a 
		lawyer, for example... 

				hadley 
		ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing 
		cocksuckers! 

				andy 
		...or come to think of it, i 
		suppose i could set it up for you. 
		that would save you some money. 
		i'll write down the forms you need, 
		you can pick them up, and i'll 
		prepare them for your signature... 
		nearly free of charge. 
			(off hadley's look) 
		i'd only ask three beers apiece for 
		my co-workers, if that seems fair. 

				trout 
			(guffawing) 
		co-workers! get him! that's rich, 
		ain't it? co-workers... 

	hadley freezes him with a look. andy presses on: 

				andy 
		i think a nan working outdoors 
		feels more like a man if he can 
		have a bottle of suds. that's only 
		my opinion. 

	the convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. they
	look like they've been pole-axed. hadley shoots them a look.

				hadley 
		what are you jimmies starin' at? 
		back to work, goddamn it!
