1	int -- cabin -- night (1946) 

	a dark, empty room. 

	the door bursts open. a man and woman enter, drunk and 
	giggling, horny as hell. no sooner is the door shut than 
	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
	flesh, mouths locked together. 

	he gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
	instead. hell with it. he's got more urgent things to do, like 
	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. she 
	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. he slams her against 
	the wall, ripping her skirt. we hear fabric tear. 

	he enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
	wall. she cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
	caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
	the sensations running through her. he carries her across the 
	room with her legs wrapped around him. they fall onto the bed. 

	camera pulls back, exiting through the window, traveling 
	smoothly outside...
