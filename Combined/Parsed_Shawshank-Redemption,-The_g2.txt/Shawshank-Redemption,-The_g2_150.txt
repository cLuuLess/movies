	tommy's taking the big test. andy's monitoring the time. deep 
	silence, save for tommy's pencil-scribbling. a few old-timers 
	are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. tommy 
	tries to ignore them. concentrate. 

	andy clears his throat. time's up. tommy puts his pencil down, 

				andy 
		well? 

				tommy 
		well. it's for shit. 
			(gets up in disgust) 
		wasted a whole fuckin' year of my 
		time with this bullshit! 

				andy 
		may not be as bad as you think. 

				tommy 
		it's worse! i didn't get a fuckin' 
		thing right! might as well be in 
		chinese! 

				andy 
		we'll see how the score comes out. 

				tommy 
		i'll tell you how the goddamn 
		score comes out... 

	tommy grabs the test, wads it, slam-dunks it into the trash.

				tommy 
		two points! right there! there's 
		your goddamn score! 
			(storms out) 
		goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 
		times 5 is 25, fuck this place, 
		fuck it! 

	tommy is gone. red and others stare. andy gets up, pulls the 
	test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk.
