213	int -- andy's cell -- night (1966) 213

	andy is polishing a chess piece. 

				voice (o.s.) 
		lights out! 

	the lights bump off. he finishes polishing, holds up the piece 
	to admire. a pawn. he sets it down with the others -- and we 
	realize it's the final glance for the board. a full set. 

	he gazes up at racquel and smiles. pulls a six foot length of 
	rope from under his pillow. lets it uncoil to the floor.
