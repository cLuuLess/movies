		he didn't say that! 

				brooks 
		god is my witness. and dekins, he 
		just blinks for a second, then 
		laughs his ass off. afterward, he 
		actually shook andy's hand. 

				heywood 
		my ass! 

				brooks 
		shook his fuckin' hand. just about 
		shit myself. all andy needed was a 
		suit and tie, a jiggly little hula 
		girl on his desk, he would'a been 
		mister dufresne, if you please. 

				red 
		makin' yourself some friends, andy. 

				andy 
		i wouldn't say "friends." i'm a 
		convicted murderer who provides 
		sound financial planning. that's a 
		wonderful pet to have. 

				red 
		got you out of the laundry, didn't 
		it? 

				andy 
		maybe it can do more than that. 
			(off their looks) 
		how about expanding the library? 
		get some new books in there. 

				heywood 
		how you 'spect to do that, "mr. 
		dufresne-if-you-please?" 

				andy 
		ask the warden for funds. 

	laughter all around. andy blinks at them. 

				brooks 
		son, i've had six wardens through 
		here during my tenure, and i have 
		learned one great immutable truth 
		of the universe: ain't one of 'em 
		been born whose asshole don't 
		pucker up tight as a snare drum 
		when you ask for funds.
