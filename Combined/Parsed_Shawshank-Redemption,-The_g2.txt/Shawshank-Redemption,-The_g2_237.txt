	red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. a squirrel 
	scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. red studies
	the base of the wall. nothing unusual here. just a bunch of
	rocks set in stone. he sighs. fool's errand. turns to go. 

	something catches his eye. he walks back, squats, peering 
	closer. wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. a layer of dust comes 
	off. volcanic glass. gleaming black. he tries to get the rock 
	out, anticipation growing. it won't come; it's too smooth. he 
	pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. it tumbles at his 
	feet, leaving a ragged hole. 

	red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the 
	object buried under the rock. stunned. it's an envelope wrapped 
	in plastic. written on it is a single word: "red." 

	red pulls the envelope out and rises. he just stares at it for 
	a while, almost afraid to open it. but open it he does. inside 
	is a smaller envelope and a letter. red begins to read: 

				andy (v.o.) 
		dear red. if you're reading this, 
		you've gotten out. and if you've 
		come this far, maybe you're willing 
		to come a little further. you 
		remember the name of the town, 
		don't you? i could use a good man 
		to help me get my project on 
		wheels. i'll keep an eye out for 
		you and the chessboard ready. 
			(beat) 
		remember, red. hope is a good 
		thing, maybe the best of things, 
		and no good thing ever dies. i will 
		be hoping that this letter finds 
		you, and finds you well. your 
		friend. andy. 

	by now, tears are spilling silently down red's cheeks. he 
	opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- 
	dollar bills. twenty of them. a thousand dollars.
