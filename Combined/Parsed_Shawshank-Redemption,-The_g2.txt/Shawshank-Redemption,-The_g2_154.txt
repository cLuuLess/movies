				norton 
		well. i have to say, that's the 
		most amazing story i ever heard. 
		what amazes me most is you were 
		taken in by it. 

				andy 
		sir? 

				norton 
		it's obvious this fellow williams 
		is impressed with you. he hears 
		your tale of woe and quite 
		naturally wants to cheer you up. 
		he's young, not terribly bright. 
		not surprising he didn't know what 
		a state he'd put you in. 

				andy 
		i think he's telling the truth. 

				norton 
		let's say for a moment blatch does 
		exist. you think he'd just fall to 
		his knees and cry, "yes, i did it! 
		i confess! by all means, please add
		a life term to my sentence!" 

				andy 
		it wouldn't matter. with tommy's 
		testimony, i can get a new trial. 

				norton 
		that's assuming blatch is even 
		still there. chances are excellent 
		he'd be released by now. excellent.

				andy 
		they'd have his last known address.
		names of relatives... 
			(norton shakes his head)
		well it's a chance. isn't it? how
		can you be so obtuse? 

				norton 
		what? what did you call me? 

				andy 
		obtuse! is it deliberate? the 
		country club will have his old time
		cards! w-2s with his name on them! 

				norton 
			(rises) 
		dufresne, if you want to indulge 
		this fantasy, that's your business.
		don't make it mine. this meeting's 
		over. 

				andy 
		look, if it's the squeeze, don't 
		worry. i'd never say what goes on 
		in here. i'd be just as indictable 
		as you for laundering the money! 

				norton 
		don't you ever mention money to me 
		again, you sorry son of a bitch! 
		not in this office, not anywhere! 
			(slaps intercom) 
		get in here! now! 

				andy 
		i was just trying to rest your mind
		at ease, that's all. 

				norton 
			(as guards enter) 
		solitary! a month! 

	andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming: 

				andy 
		what's the matter with you? it's my 
		chance to get out, don't you see 
		that? it's my life! don't you 
		understand it's my life?
