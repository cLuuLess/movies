249	int -- shaft -- night (1966) 249

	andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,
	he reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 
	conduit with his fingers. 

	suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. andy yanks away and 
	almost plummets head-first down the shaft. he dangles wildly 
	upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 
	hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. the rat 
	scurries off, pissed. 

	andy snags the conduit again. he contorts out of the hole and
	dangles into the shaft. we now see the purpose for the rope: the
	plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,

	he kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. wit3
	his back against one wall and feet against the other, he 
	starts down the shaft. sliding dangerously. using pipes for 
	handholds. flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying
	in the shadows. he drops the last few feet to the bottom. 

	he approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. 
	pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. 
	raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his 
	might. once, twice -- third time lucky. an enormous eruption 
	of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the 
	mount st. helens of shit. andy is instantly coated black. he 
	turns away and heaves his guts out. the shit keeps coming.
