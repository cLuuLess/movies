220	int -- andy's cell -- day (1966) 220

	norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up 
	into a fine rage: 

				norton 
		what do you mean "he just wasn't 
		here?" don't say that to me, haig! 
		don't say that to me again! 

				haig 
		but sir! he wasn't! he isn't! 

				norton 
		i can see that, haig! you think i'm 
		blind? is that what you're saying? 
		am i blind, haig? 

				haig 
		no sir! 

	norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at hadley. 

				norton 
		what about you? you blind? tell me 
		what this is! 

				hadley 
		last night's count. 

				norton 
		you see dufresne's name? i sure do! 
		right there, see? "dufresne." he 
		was in his cell at lights out! 
		stands to reason he'd still be here 
		this morning! i want him found! not 
		tomorrow, not after breakfast! now! 

	haig scurries out, gathering men. norton spins to red. 

				norton 
		well? 

				red 
		well what? 

				norton 
		i see you two all the time, you're 
		thick as thieves, you are! he 
		must'a said something! 

				red 
		no sir, he didn't! 

	norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around.

				norton 
		lord! it's a miracle! man up and 
		vanished like a fart in the wind! 
		nothin' left but some damn rocks on 
		the windowsill and that cupcake on 
		the wall! let's ask her! maybe she 
		knows! what say there, fuzzy- 
		britches? feel like talking? guess 
		not. why should you be different? 

	red exchanges looks with the guards. even they're nervous. 
	norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. he hurls them at
	the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words:

				norton 
		it's a conspiracy! (smash) that's 
		what this is! (smash) it's one big 
		damn conspiracy! (smash) and 
		everyone's in on it! (smash) 
		including her! 

	he sends the last rock whizzing right at racquel. 
	no smash. 

	it takes a moment for this to sink in. all eyes go to her. the 
	rock went through her. there's a small hole in the poster 
	where her navel used to be. 

	you could hear a pin drop. norton reaches up, sinks his finger 
	into the hole. he keeps pushing...and his entire hand 
	disappears into the wall. 

221 	angle from behind poster 221

	as norton rips the poster from before our eyes. stunned faces 
	peer in. camera pulls slowly back...to reveal the long 
	crumbling tunnel in the wall.
