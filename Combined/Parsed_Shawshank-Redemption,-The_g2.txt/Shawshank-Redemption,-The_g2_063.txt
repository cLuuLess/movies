85	int -- cellblock five -- night (1949) 85

	ernie is mopping the floor. he glances back and sees warden 
	norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a dozen 
	guards. still mopping, ernie mutters to the nearest cell: 

				ernie 
		heads up. they're tossin' cells. 

	word travels fast from cell to cell. cons scramble to tidy up
	and hide things. norton enters, nods to his men. the guards 
	pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. 

				guard 
		what kind'a contraband you hiding 
		in there, boy? 

	cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, 
	mattresses overturned. whatever contraband is found gets 
	tossed out onto the cellblock floor. mostly harmless stuff. 

	a guard pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, 
	shoots a nasty look at the con responsible. 

				norton 
		solitary. a week. make sure he 
		takes his bible. 

				con 
		too goddamn dark to read down there.

				norton 
		add another week for blasphemy. 

	the man is taken away. norton's gaze goes up. 

				norton 
		let's try the second tier. 

86 	2nd tier 86

	norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random.
	he motions at andy on his bunk, reading his bible. the door is
	unlocked. norton enters, trailed by his men. andy rises. 

				andy 
		good evening. 

	norton gives a curt nod. hadley and trout start tossing the
	cell in a thorough search. norton keeps his eyes on andy,
	looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. he takes the
	bible out of andy's hand. 

				norton 
		i'm pleased to see you reading 
		this. any favorite passages? 


				andy 
		watch ye therefore, for ye know not
		when the master of the house cometh. 

				norton 
			(smiles) 
		luke. chapter 13, verse 35. i've 
		always liked that one. 
			(strolls the cell) 
		but i prefer: "i am the light of 
		the world. he that followeth me 
		shall not walk in darkness, but 
		shall have the light of life." 

				andy 
		john. chapter 8, verse 12. 

				norton 
		i hear you're good with numbers. 
		how nice. a man should have a skill. 

				hadley 
		you wanna explain this? 

	andy glances over. hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a
	polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. 

				andy 
		it's called a rock blanket. it's 
		for shaping and polishing rocks. 
		little hobby of mine. 

	hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to
	norton. 

				hadley 
		looks pretty clean. some contraband 
		here, nothing to get in a twist over. 

	norton nods, strolls to the poster of rita. 

				norton 
		i can't say i approve of this... 
			(turns to andy) 
		...but i suppose exceptions can 
		always be made. 

	norton exits, the guards follow. the cell door is slammed and
	locked. norton pauses, turns back. 

				norton 
		i almost forgot. 

	he reaches through the bars and returns the bible to andy. 

				norton 
		i'd hate to deprive you of this. 
		salvation lies within. 

	norton and his men walk away. 

				red (v.o.) 
		tossin' cells was just an excuse. 
		truth is, norton wanted to size 
		andy up.
