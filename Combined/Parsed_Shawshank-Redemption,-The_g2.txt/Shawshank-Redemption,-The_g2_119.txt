155	int -- red's cell -- night (1957) 155

	...and we find red gazing blankly as darkness takes the 
	cellblock. adding up the months, weeks, days... 

	he regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a martian 
	artifact. he considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly 
	to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box
	untested. and there the harmonica will stay... 

	fade to black

		andy was as good as his word. he 
		kept writing to the state senate. 
		two letters a week instead of one. 

	...and the blackness disintegrates as a wall tumbles before 
	our eyes, revealing a work crew with picks and sledgehammers, 
	faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. 
	behind them are guards overseeing the work. 

	andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. red
	and the others follow suit. they step through the hole in the
	wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room.

		in 1959, the folks up augusta way 
		finally clued in to the fact they 
		couldn't buy him off with just a 
		200 dollar check. appropriations 
		committee voted an annual payment of 
		500 dollars, just to shut him up.
