234	int -- andy's cell -- night (1951) 234

	rita is now on the wall, hanging down over andy's back. 

				red (v.o.) 
		that and a big damn poster. 

	track in to reveal andy scraping patiently at the concrete. 

				red (v.o.) 
		like i said. in prison, a man'll do 
		most anything to keep his mind 
		occupied. 

	he hears footsteps approaching. he smoothes the poster down and 
	dives into bed. a guard strolls by a moment later, shining his 
	flashlight into the cell.
