186	int -- andy's cell -- night (1966) 186

	tight angle on chessboard. most of the pieces complete. pan to 
	andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing... 

				red (v.o.) 
		prison time is slow time. sometimes 
		it feels like stop-time. so you do 
		what you can to keep going... 

	...and we keep going past andy in a slow pan of the cell. 
	sink. toilet. books. outside the window bars, we hear another 
	train passing in the night... 

				red (v.o.) 
		some fellas collect stamps. others 
		build matchstick houses. andy built 
		a library. now he needed a new project. 
		tommy was it. it was the same reason 
		he spent years shaping and polishing 
		those rocks. the same reason he hung 
		his fantasy girlies on the wall... 

	...still panning, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and 
	finally to the place of honor on the wall... 

				red (v.o.) 
		in prison, a man'll do most 
		anything to keep his mind occupied. 

	...where the latest poster turns out to be racquel welch ins
	fur bikini. gorgeous. "one million years, b. c. " slow push in,

				red (v.o.) 
		by 1966...right about the time 
		tommy was getting ready to take his 
		exams...it was lovely racquel.
