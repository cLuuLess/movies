90	int -- shawshank prison library -- day (1949) 90

	brooks leads andy into the bleakest back room of all. rough
	plank shelves are lined with books. brooks' private domain.

				brooks 
		here she is, the shawshank prison 
		library. along this side, we got 
		the national geographics. that 
		side, the reader's digest condensed 
		books. bottom shelf there, some 
		louis l'amours and erle stanley 
		gardners. every night i pile the 
		cart and make my rounds. i write 
		down the names on this clipboard 
		here. well, that's it. easy, peasy, 
		japanesey. any questions? 

	andy pauses. something about this doesn't make any sense.

				andy 
		brooks? how long have you been 
		librarian? 

				brooks 
		since 1912. yuh, over 37 years. 

				andy 
		in all that time, have you ever had 
		an assistant? 

				brooks 
		never needed one. not much to it, 
		is there? 

				andy 
		so why now? why me? 

				brooks 
		i dunno. be nice to have some 
		comp'ny down here for a change. 

				hadley (o.s.) 
		dufresne! 

91 	andy steps back into the outer rooms and finds hadley with 91
	another guard, a huge fellow named dekins. 

				hadley 
		that's him. that's the one. 

	hadley exits. dekins approaches andy ominously. andy stands 
	his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. finally: 

				dekins 
		i'm dekins. i been, uh, thinkin' 
		'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 
		trust fund for my kids' educations. 

	andy covers his surprise. glances at brooks. brooks smiles.

				andy 
		i see. well. why don't we have a 
		seat and talk it over? 

				brooks 
		pull down one'a them desks there. 

	andy and dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the
	floor. they find chairs and settle in. brooks returns with a 
	tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before andy. 

				andy 
		what did you have in mind? a weekly 
		draw on your pay? 

				dekins 
		yuh. i figured just stick it in the 
		bank, but captain hadley said check 
		with you first. 

				andy 
		he was right. you don't want your 
		money in a bank. 

				dekins 
		i don't? 

				andy 
		what's that gonna earn you? two and 
		a half, three percent a year? we 
		can do a lot better than that. 
			(wets his pen) 
		so tell me, mr. dekins. where do 
		you want to send your kids? 
		harvard? yale?
