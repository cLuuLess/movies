217	int -- norton's office -- morning (1966) 217

	norton is kicking back with the morning paper. he notices ha
	dingy his shoes are. he glances at the shoebox on the desk. 
	kicks his shoes off, opens the box -- and gulls out andy's o
	grimy work shoes. he stares blankly. what the fuck indeed. 

	an alarm starts blaring throughout the prison. he looks up.
