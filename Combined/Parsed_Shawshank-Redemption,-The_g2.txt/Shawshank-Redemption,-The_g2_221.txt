	int -- shawshank hearings room -- day (1967) 

	red enters, sits. 20 years older than when we first saw him.

				man #1 
		your file says you've served forty 
		years of a life sentence. you feel 
		you've been rehabilitated? 

	red doesn't answer. just stares off. seconds tick by. the 
	parole board exchanges glances. somebody clears his throat. 

				man #1 
		shall i repeat the question? 

				red 
		i heard you. rehabilitated. let's 
		see now. you know, come to think of 
		it, i have no idea what that means. 

				man #2 
		well, it means you're ready to 
		rejoin society as a-- 

				red 
		i know what you think it means. me, 
		i think it's a made-up word, a poli- 
		tician's word. a word so young fellas 
		like you can wear a suit and tie and 
		have a job. what do you really want 
		to know? am i sorry for what i did? 

	- ----- 

				man g2 
		well...are you? 

				red 
		not a day goes by i don't feel 
		regret, and not because i'm in here 
		or because you think i should. i 
		look back on myself the way i 
		was...stupid kid who did that 
		terrible crime...wish i could talk 
		sense to him. tell him how things 
		are. but i can't. that kid's long 
		gone, this old man is all that's 
		left, and i have to live with that. 
			(beat) 
		rehabilitated? that's a bullshit 
		word, so you just go on ahead and 
		stamp that form there, sonny, and 
		stop wasting my damn time. truth 
		is, i don't give a shit. 

	the parole board just stares. red sits drumming his fingers. 

	closeup -- parole form 

	a big rubber stamp slams down -- and lifts away to reveal the 
	word "approved" in red ink.
