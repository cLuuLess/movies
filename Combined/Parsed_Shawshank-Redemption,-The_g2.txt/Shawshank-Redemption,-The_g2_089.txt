113	int -- brooks' room -- day (1954) 113

	brooks enters. the room is small, old, dingy. heavy wooden 
	beams cross the ceiling. an arched window affords a view of 
	congress street. traffic noise drifts in. brooks sets his bag 
	down. he doesn't quite know what to do. he just stands there, 
	like a man waiting for a bus. 

				brooks (v.o.) 
		the parole board got me into this 
		halfway house called the brewster, 
		and a job bagging groceries at the 
		foodway...
