11	int -- prison bus -- dusk (1947) 11

	andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. 

				red (v.o.) 
		andy came to shawshank prison in 
		early 1947 for murdering his wife 
		and the fella she was bangin'. 

	the bus lurches forward, rumbles through the gates. andy gazes 
	around, swallowed by prison walls. 

				red (v.o.) 
		on the outside, he'd been vice- 
		president of a large portland bank. 
		good work for a man as young as he 
		was, when you consider how 
		conservative banks were back then. 

				tower guard 
		all clear! 

	guards approach the bus with carbines. the door jerks open. 
	the new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking 
	sourly at their surroundings. andy stumbles against the man in 
	front of him, almost drags him down. 

	byron hadley, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 
	andy's back. andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. jeers 
	and shouts from the spectators. 

				hadley 
		on your feet before i fuck you up 
		so bad you never walk again. 

13 	on the bleachers 13

				red 
		there they are, boys. the human 
		charm bracelet. 

				heywood 
		never seen such a sorry-lookin' 
		heap of maggot shit in my life. 

				jigger 
		comin' from you, heywood, you being 
		so pretty and all... 

				floyd 
		takin' bets today, red? 

				red 
			(pulls notepad and pencil) 
		bear catholic? pope shit in the woods? 
		smokes or coin, bettor's choice. 

				floyd 
		smokes. put me down for two. 

				red 
		high roller. who's your horse? 

				floyd 
		that gangly sack of shit, third 
		from the front. he'll be the first. 

				heywood 
		bullshit. i'll take that action. 

				ernie 
		me too. 

	other hands go up. red jots the names. 

				heywood 
		you're out some smokes, son. take 
		my word. 

				floyd 
		you're so smart, you call it. 

				heywood 
		i say that chubby fat-ass...let's 
		see...fifth from the front. put me 
		down for a quarter deck. 

				red 
		that's five cigarettes on fat-ass. 
		any takers? 

	more hands go up. andy and the others are paraded along, 
	forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
	under the barrage of jeers and shouts. the old-timers are 
	shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
	pants. some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
	terrified. especially andy. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i must admit i didn't think much of 
		andy first time i laid eyes on him. 
		he might'a been important on the 
		outside, but in here he was just a 
		little turd in prison grays. looked 
		like a stiff breeze could blow him 
		over. that was my first impression 
		of the man. 

				skeet 
		what say, red? 

				red 
		little fella on the end. definitely. 
		i stake half a pack. any takers? 

				snooze 
		rich bet. 

				red 
		c'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me 
		wrong? 
			(hands go up) 
		floyd, skeet, joe, heywood. four brave 
		souls, ten smokes apiece. that's it, 
		gentlemen, this window's closed. 

	red pockets his notepad. a voice comes over the p.a. speakers:

				voice (amplified) 
		return to your cellblocks for 
		evening count.
