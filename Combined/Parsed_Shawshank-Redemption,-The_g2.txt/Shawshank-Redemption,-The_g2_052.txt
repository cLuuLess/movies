64	int -- prison auditorium -- night (1949) 64

	...while a convict audience hoots and catcalls, talking back 
	to the screen. we find red slouched in a folding chair, 
	watching the movie. andy enters, backlit by the flickering 
	glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him. 

				red 
		here's the good part. bugs come out 
		of the walls to get his ass. 

				andy 
		i know. i've seen it three times 
		this month already. 

	ray milland starts screaming. the entire audience screams with 
	him, high-pitched and hysterical. andy fidgets. 

				andy 
		can we talk business? 

				red 
		sure. what do you want? 

				andy 
		rita hayworth. can you get her? 

				red 
		no problem. take a few weeks. 

				andy 
		weeks? 

				red 
		don't have her stuffed down my 
		pants this very moment, sorry to 
		say. relax. what are you so nervous 
		about? she's just a woman. 

	andy nods, embarrassed. he gets up and hurries out. red grins, 
	turns back to the movie.
