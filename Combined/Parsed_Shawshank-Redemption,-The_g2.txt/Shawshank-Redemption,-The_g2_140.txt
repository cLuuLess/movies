177	int -- visitor's room -- day (1965) 177

	camera travels the room. chaotic. cons are waiting their turn 
	or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield. 

				red (v.o.) 
		as it turns out, tommy had himself 
		a young wife and new baby girl... 

	tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. other side of
	the glass is beth, near tears, fussing with a baby on her lap.

	beth 
	...said we can stay with them, but 
	joey's gettin' out of the service 
	next month, and they barely got 
	enough room as it is. plus they got 
	poppa workin' double shifts and the 
	baby cries half the night. i just 
	don't know where we're gonna go... 

	push in on tommy's face as he listens. 

				red (v.o.) 
		maybe it was the thought of them on 

	the streets...or his child growing 
	up not knowing her daddy...
