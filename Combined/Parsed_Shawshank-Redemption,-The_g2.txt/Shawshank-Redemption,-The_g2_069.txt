93	int -- main building hallway -- day (1949) 93

	dollying norton and andy up the hall: 

				norton 
		not a dime. my budget's stretched 
		thin as it is. 

				andy 
		i see. perhaps i could write to the 
		state senate and request funds 
		directly from them. 

				norton 
		far as them republican boys in 
		augusta are concerned, there's only 
		three ways to spend the taxpayer's 
		hard-earned when it come to prisons. 
		more walls. more bars. more guards. 

				andy 
		still, i'd like to try, with your 
		permission. i'll send a letter a 
		week. they can't ignore me forever. 

				norton 
		they sure can, but you write your 
		letters if it makes you happy. i'll 
		even mail 'em for you, how's that?
