	heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about andy. 

				red (v.o.) 
		those of us who knew him best talk 
		about him often. i swear, the stuff 
		he pulled. it always makes us laugh. 

	a wild burst of laughter. push in on red. feeling melancholy.

				red (v.o.) 
		sometimes it makes me sad, though, 
		andy being gone. i have to remind 
		myself that some birds aren't meant 
		to be caged, that's all. their 
		feathers are just too bright...
