293	int -- red's room -- day (1967) 293

	red is dressed in his suit. he finishes knotting his tie, puts 
	his hat on. his bag is by the door. he takes one last look 
	around. only one thing left to do. he pulls a wooden chair to 
	the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. 

				red (v.o.) 
		get busy living or get busy dying. 
		that is goddamn right. 

	he steps up on the chair. it wobbles under his weight.
