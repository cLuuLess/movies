	his wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. loose bullets scatter to 
	the ground. the bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 

	he starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. the closer he 
	gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. louder and more 
	frenzied. the lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
	passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts.

	andy lurches to a stop, listening. the woman cries out in 
	orgasm. the sound slams into andy's brain like an icepick. he 
	shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop.

	is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. we hear 
	languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction.

	much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
	path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
	held loosely at his side. a pathetic figure, really.
