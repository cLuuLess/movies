	-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, 
	shutting everything out, breathing heavily. alone now. 

	he goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. 
	he can still hear them out there. they won't go away. he 
	glances around the restroom. small. not small enough. 

	he enters a stall. locks the door. puts the toilet lid down

	touch the walls now. they're close. safe. almost small enough. 
	he draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. 

	he'll just sit here for a while. until he calms down.
