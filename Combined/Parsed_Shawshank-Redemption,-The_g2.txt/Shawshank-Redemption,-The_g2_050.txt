	andy and red play checkers. red makes his move. 

				red 
		king me. 

				andy 
		chess. now there's a game of kings. 
		civilized...strategic... 

				red 
		...and totally fuckin' 
		inexplicable. hate that game. 

				andy 
		maybe you'll let me teach you 
		someday. i've been thinking of 
		getting a board together. 

				red 
		you come to the right place. i'm 
		the man who can get things. 

				andy 
		we might do business on a board. but 
		the pieces, i'd like to carve those 
		myself. one side done in quartz... 
		the opposing side in limestone. 

				red 
		that'd take you years. 

				andy 
		years i've got. what i don't have 
		are the rocks. pickings here in the 
		exercise yard are pretty slim. 

				red 
		how's that rock-hammer workin' out 
		anyway? scratch your name on your 
		wall yet? 

				andy 
			(smiles) 
		not yet. i suppose i should. 

				red 
		andy? i guess we're gettin' to be 
		friends, ain't we? 

				andy 
		i suppose we are. 

				red 
		i ask a question? why'd you do it? 

				andy 
		i'm innocent, remember? just like 
		everybody else here. 

	red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing. 

				andy 
		what are you in for, red? 

				red 
		murder. same as you. 

				andy 
		innocent? 

				red 
		the only guilty man in shawshank.
