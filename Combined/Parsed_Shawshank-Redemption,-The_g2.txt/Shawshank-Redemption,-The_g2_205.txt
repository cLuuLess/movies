	a man in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. 
	he finds andy's package, rips it open. pulls out the black 
	ledger and files. scans a cover letter. holy shit. he dashes 
	to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the 
	glass: "portland daily bugle -- editor in chief."
