               int. asylum corridor - upper floor - day

               clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate clangs shut behind 
               her, the bolt shooting home. chilton walks ahead of her.

                         lecter carved up nine people - that 
                         we're sure of - and cooked his 
                         favorite bits. we've tried to study 
                         him, of course - but he's much too 
                         sophisticated for the standard tests. 
                         and my, does he hate us! thinks i'm 
                         his nemesis... crawford's very clever, 
                         isn't he? using you.

                         how do you mean, dr. chilton?

                                     chilton
                         a pretty young woman, to turn him 
                         on? i don't believe lecter's ever 
                         seen a woman in eight years. and oh, 
                         are you ever his "taste" - so to 
                         speak.

                         i graduated magna from uva, doctor. 
                         it's not a charm school.

                         good. then you should be able to 
                         remember the rules.
