               int. third floor corridor - night

               two swat officers, peterson and kubell, turn a key, unlocking 
               and opening this floor's elevator doorway. the shaft is dark. 
               lying prone, they inch up to the edge, peterson extends a 
               mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft.

               in the mirror (distorted by the angle)

               is a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on 
               his stomach, atop the elevator. a shiny revolver is near one 
               hand.

               peterson

               whispers into a radio, as kubell carefully tips an assault 
               rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge.

                                     peterson
                         i see him... there's a weapon by his 
                         hand. he's not moving...

                                     radio voice
                         can you get the drop?

                                     peterson
                         we got the drop.

                                     radio voice
                         one warning. then take him out.

               peterson nods to kubell, who switches on the flashlight, as 
               peterson shouts down the shaft.

                                     peterson
                         quinn!! put your hands on your head!!

               in the mirror

               the green figure shows no movement.

               angle on the cops again

               as peterson mutters to kubell.

                                     peterson
                         put one in his leg.

               very close on

               the figure below, as kubell's gunshot roars, echoing hugely 
               in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg. 
               the figure doesn't stir.

               peterson

               staring down the shaft, raises his mike again.

                                     peterson
                         no movement.

                                     radio voice
                         okay, johnny, hold your fire...

                                                                    cut to:
