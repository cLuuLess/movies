               int. recreation room - fbi academy - dawn

               close on a tv screen, filled with a photo of catherine martin.

                                     tv anchor (v.o.)
                         ...was listed at first simply as a 
                         missing person, but is now believed 
                         to have been kidnapped by the serial 
                         killer known only as "buffalo bill."

               the photo disappears, replaced by the tv anchor himself.

                         memphis police sources indicate that 
                         the missing girl's blouse has been 
                         identified, sliced up the back, in 
                         what has become a kind of grim calling 
                         card. young catherine martin, as 
                         we've said, is the only daughter of 
                         u.s. senator ruth martin -

               clarice

               looks at ardelia, surprised. other trainees are drifting 
               into the rec room, some whispering among themselves. clarice 
               stares back at the tv intently.

                                     tv anchor (o.s.)
                         ...the republican junior senator 
                         from tennessee. and while her 
                         kidnapping is not at this point 
                         considered to be politically 
                         motivated, nevertheless it has stirred 
                         the government -

               back on the tv anchor

                                     tv anchor
                         ...to its highest levels, the 
                         president himself being said to be, 
                         and i quote, "intensely concerned." 
                         just moments ago, senator martin 
                         made this dramatic personal plea...

               senator martin (tv footage)

               fills the screen, in a halo of lens flare, as she speaks to 
               a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her 
               georgetown home. a tall woman, late 40's, with a strong, 
               taut face.

                                     sen. martin
                         i'm speaking now to the person who 
                         is holding my daughter. her name is 
                         catherine... you have the power to 
                         let catherine go, unharmed. she's 
                         very gentle and kind - talk to her 
                         and you'll see. her name is 
                         catherine...

               clarice is moved by what she sees. other trainees are all 
               around her.

                                     clarice
                              (whispers)
                         boy, is that smart...

                                     ardelia
                         why does she keep repeating the name?

                                     clarice
                         somebody's coaching her... they're 
                         trying to make him see catherine as 
                         a person - not just an object.

               on the tv again

                                     sen. martin
                         you have a chance to show the whole 
                         world that you can be merciful, as
                         well as strong. please - i beg you - 
                         release my catherine...

               new footage

               as we see (night, telephoto) - a taped-off section of 
               catherine's parking lot. technicians, with instruments, are 
               kneeling by the crushed grocery bag.

                         meanwhile. in memphis, the 
                         investigation continued throughout 
                         the night, as state and local 
                         authorities were joined at the kidnap 
                         scene by agents of the fbi...

               moving angle (still tv footage)

               as jack crawford is seen striding towards the front door of 
               catherine's apartment, followed by burroughs and other agents. 
               one of them moves quickly towards the camera, waving it back.

               rec room angle - favoring ardelia

               as the other trainees send up a brief, ironic cheer. but 
               ardelia turns sympathetically towards the troubled clarice.

                                     ardelia
                         i don't know whether to say "i'm 
                         sorry," or "congratulations." but 
                         girl? - you just went prime time.

                                                                    cut to:
