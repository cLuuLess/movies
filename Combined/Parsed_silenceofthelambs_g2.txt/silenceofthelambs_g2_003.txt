               ext. fbi academy grounds, quantico, virginia - day

               crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, 
               as clarice joins him. he looks tired, haunted. between master 
               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.

                                     crawford
                         starling, clarice m., good morning.

                                     clarice
                         good morning, mr. crawford.

                                     crawford
                         your instructors tell me you're doing 
                         well. top quarter of the class.

                                     clarice
                         i hope so. they haven't posted 
                         anything.

                                     crawford
                         a job's come up and i thought about 
                         you. not really a job, more of - an 
                         interesting errand. walk me to my 
                         car, starling.

               they begin to cross the academy grounds. a group of trainees 
               jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.

                                     crawford
                         we're trying to interview all of the 
                         serial killers now in custody, for a 
                         psychobehavioral profile. could be a 
                         big help in unsolved cases. most of 
                         them have been happy to talk to us. 
                         they have a compulsion to boast, 
                         these people... do you spook easily, 
                         starling?

                                     clarice
                         not yet.

                                     crawford
                         you see, the one we want most refuses 
                         to cooperate. i want you to go after 
                         him again today, in the asylum.

                                     clarice
                         who's the subject?

                                     crawford
                         the psychiatrist - dr. hannibal 
                         lecter.

               clarice stops walking, goes very still. a beat.

                                     clarice
                         the cannibal...

               crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.

                                     clarice
                         yes, well... okay, right. i'm glad 
                         for the chance, sir, but - why me?

                                     crawford
                         you're qualified and available. and 
                         frankly, i can't spare a real agent 
                         right now.

               he walks on again, at a faster clip. she hurried to keep up.

                                     crawford
                         i don't expect him to talk to you, 
                         but i have to be able to say we 
                         tried... lecter was a brilliant 
                         psychiatrist, and he knows all the 
                         dodges.
                              (hands her the manila 
                              envelope)
                         dossier on him, copy of our 
                         questionnaire, special id for you... 
                         if he won't talk, then i want straight 
                         reporting. how's he look, how's his 
                         cell look, what's he writing? the 
                         director himself will see your report, 
                         over your own signature - if i decide 
                         it's good enough. i want that by 
                         0800 wednesday, and keep this to 
                         yourself.

               they're reached his car. his driver stamps on a cigarette, 
               climbs in behind the wheel. burroughs, his assistant, says 
               something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door. 
               but crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. his 
               intensity is scary.

                                     crawford
                         now. i want your full attention, 
                         starling. are you listening to me?

                                     clarice
                         yes sir.

                                     crawford
                         be very careful with hannibal lecter. 
                         dr. chilton at the asylum will go 
                         over the physical procedures used 
                         with him. do not deviate from them, 
                         for any reason. you tell him nothing 
                         personal, starling. believe me, you 
                         don't want hannibal lecter inside 
                         your head... just do your job, but 
                         never forget what he is.

                                     clarice
                              (a bit unnerved)
                         and what is that, sir?

                                     chilton (v.o.)
                         oh, he's a monster. a pure 
                         psychopath...

                                                                    cut to:
