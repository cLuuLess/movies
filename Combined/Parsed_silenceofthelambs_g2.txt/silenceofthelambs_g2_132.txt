               int. dorm hallway - night

               clarice picks up the dangling pay phone, speaks happily.

                                     clarice
                         starling.

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         well, clarice, have the lambs stopped 
                         screaming...?

               she freezes, stunned by the familiar voice. then she turns, 
               waving frantically towards

               ardelia

               who is just inside the rec room door, at the end of the hall, 
               lost in conversation with pilcher and roden. ardelia glances 
               at her briefly but misunderstands, waves cheerfully back.

                                     dr. lecter (v.o.)
                         don't bother with a trace, i won't 
                         be on long enough.

               clarice

               turns back, gripping the phone more tightly.

                                     clarice
                         where are you, dr. lecter?

                                                                    cut to:
