               stacy hubka - short, perky, early 20's - sits nervously at 
               her desk, talking to clarice, who jots in her notebook. in 
               the background. beyond them, bank tellers, lines of waiting 
               customers, muzak.

                         they said she was just rags, like
                         somebody -

                         stacy, did fredrica ever mention a 
                         man named jamie gumb? or john grant?
                              (stacy shakes her 
                              head)
                         do you think she could've had a friend 
                         you didn't know about?

                                     stacy
                         no way. she had a guy, i'da known, 
                         believe me. sewing was her life, she 
                         was really great at it. poor freddie.

                                     clarice
                         did you ever work with her?

                                     stacy
                         oh sure, me'n pam malavesi used to 
                         help her do alterations for old mrs. 
                         lippman. lots of people worked for 
                         her, she had the business from all 
                         these retail stores? but she was 
                         like, totally old, it was more'n she 
                         could handle.

                                     clarice
                         where does mrs. lippman live? i'd 
                         like to talk to her.

                                     stacy
                         she died. she went to florida to 
                         retire, like two years ago? she dies 
                         own there.

               clarice reacts, disappointed at the ending of this trail.

                                     stacy
                              (beat; shyly)
                         is that a pretty good job, fbi agent?

                                     clarice
                         i think so.

                                     stacy
                         you get to travel around and stuff? 
                         i mean, better places then this?

                                     clarice
                         sometimes you do.

                         freddie was so happy for me when i 
                         got this job. this - toaster 
                         giveaways, and barry manilow on the 
                         speakers all day - she thought this 
                         was really hot shit. what did she 
                         know, big dummy...

               suddenly she's fighting tears. clarice reaches to hug her.
