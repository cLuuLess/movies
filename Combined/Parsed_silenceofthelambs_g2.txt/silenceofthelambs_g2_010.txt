               int. fbi academy library - night

               close on a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of dr. 
               lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("new 
               horrors in cannibal trial"), dated 1980.

               clarice is punching keys on the terminal. other trainees 
               study at nearby tables.

               she pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as ardelia comes by, 
               carrying an armful of books.

                                     ardelia
                         phone call, clarice. it's god.

                                     clarice
                         thanks, ardelia.

               moving angle

               as clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows ardelia 
               past high metal bookstacks.

                                     ardelia
                         you missed fourth amendment law. 
                         unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. 
                         where were you all afternoon?

                                     clarice
                         pleading with a crazy man, with come 
                         all over my face.

               ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs.

                                     ardelia
                         damn. wish i had time for a social 
                         life.

               clarice grins, as ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting 
               on the check-out desk, then moves on. clarice picks it up.

                                     clarice
                              (on phone)

                                                                    cut to:
