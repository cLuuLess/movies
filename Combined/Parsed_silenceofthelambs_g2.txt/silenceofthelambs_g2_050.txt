               int. fbi building - office of the director - day

               hayden burke, the fbi director, swivels in his big chair. 
               lean, late 40's, very distinguished. his desk is flanked by 
               flags.

                                     director burke
                              (on phone)
                         already airborne for memphis. senator 
                         martin's meeting him at the airport.
                              (uneasily)
                         jack - did you make some sort of 
                         promise to lecter, in the senator's 
                         name?

               listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his 
               desk at paul krendler, the deputy attorney general - 40, 
               very tanned, modish haircut. krendler is irritable, impatient.

                                     director burke
                              (on phone)
                         we're going to have to talk about 
                         this, jack. the senator's mad as 
                         hell. paul krendler's over here from 
                         justice, she's asking him to take 
                         charge in memphis... i know that... 
                         but you're still in command of the 
                         task force, and lecter's plane can 
                         still be ordered back. it's your 
                         call, jack - but i want it now.

                                                               cut back to:
