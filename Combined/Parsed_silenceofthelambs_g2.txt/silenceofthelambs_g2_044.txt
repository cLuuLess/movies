               int. dr. lecter's cell and corridor - day

               dr. lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with 
               charcoal on butcher paper.

               he uses his own hand and forearm as a model. his other 
               drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.

                                     dr. lecter
                         wouldn't you say, clarice, that for 
                         a united states senator, you're an 
                         odd choice of messenger?

               clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers 
               from her briefcase.

                                     clarice
                         i was your choice, dr. lecter. you 
                         chose to speak to me. would you prefer 
                         someone else now? or perhaps you 
                         don't think you can help us.

                                     dr. lecter
                         that is both impudent and untrue... 
                         tell me, how did you feel when you 
                         viewed our billy's latest effort?
                              (beat; he smiles)
                         or should i say, his "next-to-latest"?

                                     clarice
                         by the book, he's a sadist.

                                     dr. lecter
                         life's too slippery for books, 
                         clarice. typhoid and swans came from 
                         the same god.
                              (beat)
                         tell me, miss west virginia - was 
                         she a large girl?

                                     clarice
                         yes.

                                     dr. lecter
                         big through the hips. roomy.

                                     clarice
                         they all were.

                                     dr. lecter
                         mmm. and what else...?

                                     clarice
                         she had an insect deliberately 
                         inserted in her throat. that hasn't 
                         been made public yet. we don't know 
                         what is means.

                                     dr. lecter
                         was it a butterfly?

                                     clarice
                              (pause; staring at 
                              him)
                         a moth... how did you predict that?

                                     dr. lecter
                         i'm waiting for your offer, clarice. 
                         enchant me.

               clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect 
               her thoughts. she looks up at him again, evenly.

                                     clarice
                         if you help us find buffalo bill in 
                         time to save catherine martin, the 
                         senator promises you a transfer to 
                         the v.a. hospital at oneida park, 
                         new york, with a view of the woods 
                         nearby. maximum security still 
                         applies, but you'd have reasonable 
                         access to books.

               he is silent. she rises, moves closer, carrying papers.

                                     clarice
                         best of all, though - one week a 
                         year you'd get to leave the hospital 
                         and go here.
                              (points to a map)
                         plum island. every afternoon of that 
                         week you can walk on the beach or 
                         swim in the ocean for up to one hour. 
                         under swat team surveillance, of 
                         course...

               his face remains neutral. she puts the papers in his food 
               tray.

                                     clarice
                         copy of the buffalo bill case file, 
                         copy of senator martin's terms. her 
                         offer is final and non-negotiable. 
                         if catherine dies -
                              (she slides his tray 
                              through)
                         you get nothing.

               a measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks 
               down at the papers, without touching them.

                                     dr. lecter
                         "plum island animal disease research 
                         center." sounds charming.

                                     clarice
                         that's just part of the island. it 
                         has a very nice beach. terns nest 
                         there.

                                     dr. lecter
                         terns... if i help you, clarice, it 
                         will be "turns" with us, too. quid 
                         pro quo. i tell you things, you tell 
                         me things. not about this case, though - 
                         about yourself. yes or no?
                              (she is silent)
                         yes or no, clarice. catherine is 
                         waiting. tick-tock, tick-tock...

               she looks at him. a beat. they are standing uncomfortably 
               close.

                                     clarice
                         go, doctor.

                                     dr. lecter
                         what's your worst memory of childhood?
                              (she hesitates)
                         quicker than that. i'm not interested 
                         in your worst invention.

                                     clarice
                         the death of my father.

                                     dr. lecter
                         tell me. don't lie, or i'll know.

               clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. she 
               looks past him, hesitating again.

                                     clarice
                         he was a town marshal... one night 
                         he surprised two burglars, coming 
                         out the back of a drugstore... they 
                         shot him.

                                     dr. lecter
                         killed outright?

                                     clarice
                         no. he was strong, he lasted almost 
                         a month. my mother - died when i was
                         very young, so my father had become - 
                         the whole world to me... after he 
                         left me, i had nobody. i was ten 
                         years old.

                                     dr. lecter
                         you're very frank, clarice. i think - 
                         it would be quite something to know 
                         you in private life.

                                     clarice
                         quid pro quo, doctor.

                                     dr. lecter
                         the significance of the moth is 
                         change. caterpillar into cocoon into 
                         beauty... billy wants to change, 
                         too, clarice. but there's the problem 
                         of his size, you see. even if he 
                         were a woman, he'd have to be a big 
                         one...

                                     clarice
                              (puzzled)
                         dr. lecter, there's no correlation 
                         in the literature between 
                         transsexualism and violence. 
                         transsexuals are very passive.

                                     dr. lecter
                         clever girl. you're so close to the 
                         way you're going to catch him - do 
                         you realize that?

                                     clarice
                         no. tell me why.

                                     dr. lecter
                         after your father's death, you were 
                         orphaned. what happened next?
                              (clarice drops her 
                              gaze)
                         i don't imagine the answer's on those 
                         second-rate shoes, clarice.

                                     clarice
                         i went to live with my mother's cousin 
                         and her husband in montana. they had 
                         a ranch.

                                     dr. lecter
                         a cattle ranch?

                                     clarice
                         horses - and sheep...

                                     dr. lecter
                         how long did you live there?

                                     clarice
                         two months.

                                     dr. lecter
                         why so briefly?

                                     clarice
                         i - ran away...

                                     dr. lecter
                         why, clarice? did the rancher fuck 
                         you?

                                     clarice
                              (angrily)
                         no.

                                     dr. lecter
                         did he try to?

                                     clarice
                         no...! quid pro quo, doctor.

                                     dr. lecter
                         billy's not a real transsexual, but 
                         he thinks he is. he tries to be. 
                         he's tried to be a lot of things, i 
                         expect.

                                     clarice
                         you said - i was very close to the 
                         way we'd catch him.

                                     dr. lecter
                         there are three major centers for 
                         transsexual surgery: johns hopkins, 
                         the university of minnesota, and 
                         columbus medical center. i wouldn't 
                         be surprised if billy has applied 
                         for sex reassignment at one or all 
                         of them, and been rejected.

                                     clarice
                         on what basis would they reject him?

                                     dr. lecter
                         the personality inventories would 
                         trip him up. rorschach, wechsler, 
                         house-tree-person... he wouldn't 
                         test like a real transsexual.

                                     clarice
                         how would he test?

               suddenly dr. lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. clarice take 
               a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement 
               into an elaborate yawn. he gathers the papers from his tray.

                                     dr. lecter
                         that's enough, i think. happy hunting. 
                         oh, and clarice - next time you will 
                         tell me why you ran away. shall i 
                         summarize?

                                     clarice
