               ext. grounds of the fbi academy - weeks later - day

               the forty members of clarice's class, resplendent in their 
               best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then 
               turn happily to wave to their audience, as applause mounts. 
               beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the director stands

               clarice and ardelia

               look at one another solemnly. ardelia holds up both fists, 
               in a power shake, and clarice taps them with her own. she is

               still rising from their folding chairs, applauding in 
               celebration of these special young people, this perfect, 
               sunlit day.

               sound upcut - rock music, laughter - as we...

                                                               dissolve to:
