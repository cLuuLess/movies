               int. mr. gumb's cellar - day (green light)

               slowly, savoring the moment, mr. gumb aims the big colt, 
               which is already cocked, using both hands... he is just about 
               to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his door buzzer, 
               surprisingly loud and close by. he turns, startled, and sees -

               dusty black metal box

               the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is 
               making the hideous, grating jangle. it finally stops, but 
               not before waking precious, who starts frantically barking,

               two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass.

               mr. gumb

               bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to 
               safely place his shot. the maddening buzzer sounds again, 
               even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and 
               fury. but as the buzzer continues, he reluctantly uncocks 
               his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door...

                                                                    cut to:
