               int. rental car - day (driving)

               crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a 
               winding mountain road. clarice has the file open on her lap. 
               he glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses.

                                     crawford
                         talk about him, starling. tell me 
                         what you see.

                                     clarice
                              (choosing her words 
                              carefully)
                         he's a white male... serial killers 
                         tend to hunt within their own ethnic 
                         group. and he's not a drifter - he's 
                         got his own house, somewhere. not an 
                         apartment.

                                     crawford
                         why?

                                     clarice
                         what he does with them - takes 
                         privacy... time, tools... he's in 
                         his 30's or 40's - he's got real 
                         physical strength, but combined with 
                         an older man's self-control. he's 
                         cautious, precise, never impulsive... 
                         this won't end in suicide, like they 
                         often do.

                                     crawford
                         why not?

                                     clarice
                         he's got a real taste for it now. 
                         and he's getting better at his work.

                                     crawford
                              (a beat; impressed)
                         maybe you've got a knack for this... 
                         i guess we're about to find out.

                                     clarice
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         like i have a "knack" for dr. lecter?

               he studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.

                                     crawford
                         okay, starling. let's have it.

                                     clarice
                         you haven't said a word today about 
                         that garage. or what i found there.

                                     crawford
                         what should i say? you did fine work. 
                         we'll wait on the lab.

                                     clarice
                         you knew. you knew from the start 
                         that lecter held the key to this... 
                         but you weren't up front with me. 
                         you sent me in to him naked.

                                     crawford
                              (beat)
                         are you finished?

                                     clarice
                         he starts this - buzzing in me, in 
                         my head. he makes me feel violated... 
                         you used me, mr. crawford.

               a shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers 
               sternly.

                                     crawford
                         number one. maybe there's a 
                         connection, maybe not. lying and 
                         breathing are the same thing to 
                         lecter. number two. if i'd sent you 
                         in there with something to hide from 
                         him, he'd have known it, instantly. 
                         he'd never have trusted you.

               she starts to answer, then is silent. he is right.

               by now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree-
               lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in 
               the background. they slow, turn.

                                     crawford
                         number three, i didn't bring you 
                         along today just because you can do 
                         first-rate forensics. if lecter is 
                         becoming part of this case, you've 
                         got the most current read on him. 
                         and number four - you don't have to 
                         like me, or the way i do things. but 
                         you do have to keep a cool head. 
                         especially now... because from here 
                         on out, you'll know everything i do. 
                         are we straight on that?

               clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's 
               likely to get. she stares out the windshield.

               just ahead of them

               the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other 
               police cars, facing a big white frame house. its sign reads 
               "potter funeral home." two troopers climb from the car.

               crawford parks too, then kills the engine. he turns to her, 
               removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.

                                     crawford
                              (softly)
                         you think about him long enough, you 
                         get a feel for him... then, if you're 
                         lucky, out of all the stuff you know, 
                         one little part of it tugs at you, 
                         tries to get your attention... you 
                         let me know when that happens, 
                         starling. live right behind your 
                         eyes, today. don't try to impose any 
                         patterns on this guy. just stay open 
                         and let him show you...

               one of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, 
               peers in through crawford's window. crawford nods to him, 
               then turns back to clarice.

                                     crawford
                         school's out, starling.

                                                                    cut to:
