               int. bimmel house - staircase - day

               high angle - looking down as mr. bimmel leads clarice up a 
               steep flight of steps. the bannister is worn, sags a bit.

                                     mr. bimmel
                         i don't know nothin' new to tell ya. 
                         the police been back here so many 
                         times already... fredrica went into 
                         columbus on the bus to see about a 
                         job. she left the interview ok. she 
                         never come home.

               clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: 
               the familiar graduation portrait. others pictures show 
               fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful 
               at each age.

                                     mr. bimmel
                         her room's how she left it. just 
                         shut the door when you're done.

                                                                    cut to:
