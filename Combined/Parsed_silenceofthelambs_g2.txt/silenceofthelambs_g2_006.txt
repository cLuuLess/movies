               int. different corridor - lower floor - day

               a darker, even grimmer area. heavy grids over the lights. 
               distant slammings and faint, hoarse shouts. they walk briskly.

                         do not reach through the bars, do 
                         not touch the bars. you pass him 
                         nothing but soft paper - no pens or 
                         pencils. no staples or paperclips in 
                         his paper. use the sliding food 
                         carrier, no exceptions. do not accept 
                         anything he attempts to hold out to 
                         you. do you understand me?

                                     clarice
                         i understand.

                                     chilton
                         i'm going to show you why we insist 
                         on such precautions... on the 
                         afternoon of july 8, 1981, he 
                         complained of chest pains and was 
                         taken to the dispensary. his 
                         mouthpiece and restraints were removed 
                         for an ekg. when the nurse bent over 
                         him, he did this to her...

               he hands clarice a small, dog-eared photo. looking at it, 
               she is stopped in her tracks. this pleases chilton.

                                     chilton
                         the doctors managed to re-set her 
                         jaw, more or less, and save one of 
                         her eyes. his pulse never got over 
                         eighty-five, even when he ate her 
                         tongue.
                              (pauses, he smiles)
                         i keep him in here.

               he turns, pushes a button. a steel door buzzes slowly open, 
               and barney - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an 
               anteroom. on its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, mace, 
               tranquilizer guns.

                                     clarice
                              (quickly blocking him)
                         dr. chilton - if lecter feels you're 
                         his enemy - as you've said - then 
                         maybe i'll have more luck by myself. 
                         what do you think?

                                     chilton
                              (annoyed)
                         you might have suggested that in my 
                         office, and saved me the time.

                                     clarice
                         but then i would've missed the 
                         pleasure of your company.

               she holds out the photo. a beat. he grabs it, jaw twitching.

                                     chilton
                         when she's finished, bring her out.

               he turns on his heel, goes. barney smiles reassuringly.

                                     barney
                         hi, i'm barney. he told you, don't 
                         get near the bars?

                                     clarice
                              (shaking his hand)
                         clarice starling. yes, he did.

                                     barney
                         okay. past the others, it's the last 
                         cell. stay to the middle. i put out 
                         a chair for you.

               sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.

                                     barney
                         i'm watching. you'll do fine.

               clarice nods gratefully. she looks down the long corridor, 
               takes a deep breath, walks into it. he watches her go.

                                                                    cut to:
