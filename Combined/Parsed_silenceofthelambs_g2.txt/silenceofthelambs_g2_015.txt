               int. the storage shed - dusk (very dark)

               clarice, backlit, peers under the door. she reaches in, makes 
               a sweep with her flashlight. we catch shadowy outlines - 
               boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...

               sound of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small 
               rustlings. mr. yow's chubby face appears down beside 
               clarice's.

                                     mr. yow
                         it smells like mice... i think i 
                         hear them, too - don't you?

               clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door.

                                     mr. yow
                         you're going in there?
