               night

               catherine martin takes a long toke from a bong pipe. she is 
               21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown 
               fair. her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, cody; they're 
               sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished 
               apartment. the tv in on, with low sound.

                                     catherine
                         this stuff's givin' me the munchies. 
                         where's that bag of popcorn?

                                     cody
                         shit. left the groceries in the car.

               he starts to rise, but she pushes him back.

                                     catherine
                         's okay, i'll go.

               she rises, goes out the front door.

                                                                    cut to:
