               int. courthouse - ground floor lobby - night

               the bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then 
               indicates a stop there, at the top floor.

               favoring sgt. tate

               at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. another 
               cop, jacobs, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a 
               magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in 
               the lobby.

                                     sgt. tate
                         what is this shit...? did somebody 
                         go up to five?
                              (jacobs shakes his 
                              head)
                         call pembry, ask him what -

               a gunshot, and then, moments later, two more quick ones, 
               echo down the nearby stairwell. sgt. tate jumps to his feet, 
               grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and 
               noisy.

                                     sgt. tate
                              (into mike)
                         cp, shots fired on five! repeat, 
                         shots fires on five! outside posts 
                         look sharp, we've got a... ho-ly 
                         shit.

               the bronze arrow

               has begun to descend. down to 4, then past 4...

               back on sgt. tate

               as he reacts. the other cops, behind him, are now in a full 
               uproar, shouting, pulling out guns.

                                     sgt. tate
                              (to the others)
                         shut up...! guard mount, double up 
                         on your outside posts. bobby, get 
                         the vests. rainey, howard, cover 
                         that fucking elevator if it comes 
                         all the way to -

                                     a cop (o.s.)
                         it stopped!

               the bronze arrow

               has, indeed, frozen at 3. sgt. tate lifts the microphone 
               again.

                         seal off a ten-block radius. get me 
                         the swat team and an ambulance, double 
                         quick. we're going up.
