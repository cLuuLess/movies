               int. chilton's office - baltimore state hospital for the 
               criminally insane - day

               close on an id card held in a male hand. clarice's photo, 
               official-looking graphics. it calls her a "federal 
               investigator."

                                     chilton (o.s.)
                         it's so rare to capture one alive. 
                         from a research point of view, dr. 
                         lecter is our most prized asset...

               dr. frederick chilton looks up from her card. a smarmy little 
               peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, 
               hopeless letch for clarice. he smiles, stroking her card 
               with his beloved gold pen.

                         you know, we get a lot of detectives 
                         here, but i must say, i can't ever 
                         remember one so attractive...

               new angle - reveals clarice

               now wearing a more feminine skirt suit. hair neatly coiled, 
               elegant shoulder bag, briefcase. he has rudely left her 
               standing.

                                     chilton
                         will you be in baltimore overnight...? 
                         because this can be quite a fun town, 
                         if you have the right guide.

               clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him.

                                     clarice
                         i'm sure it's a great town, dr. 
                         chilton, but my instructions are to 
                         talk to lecter and report back this 
                         afternoon.

                              (pause, sourly)
                         i see.
                              (beat)
                         let's make this quick, then. i'm 
                         busy.

                                                                    cut to:
