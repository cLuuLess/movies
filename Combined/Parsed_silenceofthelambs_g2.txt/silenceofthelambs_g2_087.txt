               int. clarice's dorm room - night

               clarice is hunched on her cot, in a bathrobe, her hair wet. 
               the buffalo bill case file, a thick bundle, rests by her 
               feet. ardelia hovers anxiously nearby.

                                     ardelia
                         in the parking garage at memphis 
                         airport. the crew was dead. he killed 
                         a tourist, too. got his clothes, 
                         cash... by now he could be anywhere.

               clarice looks up. her eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, 
               and something close to despair. she reads ardelia's thought.

                                     clarice
                         no. he won't come after me.

                                     ardelia
                         why not?

                                     clarice
                              (bitterly)
                         it would be rude. and he wouldn't 
                         get to ask any more questions...

               ardelia sits beside her, touches her arm.

                                     ardelia
                         clarice - you did the best anybody 
                         could have for catherine martin. you 
                         stuck your neck out for her and you 
                         got your butt kicked for her and you 
                         tried. it's not your fault it ended 
                         this way.

                                     clarice
                         the worst part - the thing that's 
                         making me crazy - is that bill is 
                         right in front of me. only i can't 
                         see him...
                              (touching the case 
                              file)
                         lecter said, everything i need to 
                         catch him is right here, in these 
                         pages...

                                     ardelia
                         lecter said a lot of things.

                                     clarice
                              (shakes her head)
                         he's here, ardelia.

               ardelia stares back at her.

               sound upcut - the low throb of a washing machine...

                                                                    cut to:
