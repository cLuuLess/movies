               int. mr. gumb's parlor - day

               clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances 
               around the musty-looking room.

                                     mr. gumb (o.s.)
                         that horrible business, i shiver 
                         every time i think about it...

               overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. one archway onto 
               the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through 
               there, the kitchen. mr. gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, 
               raising the top. he bends over, begins poking through cubby 
               holes. his tone is casual, neutral.

                                     mr. gumb
                         are they close to catching somebody, 
                         do you think?

                                     clarice
                         i think we may be, yes.

               mr. gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. his back is to her, 
               as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.

                                     clarice
                         mr. gordon, did you take over this 
                         place after mrs. lippman died?

                                     mr. gumb
                         yes. i bought the house from her, 
                         two years ago.

                                     clarice
                         did she leave any records here? tax 
                         or business records? maybe a list of 
                         employees?

               close on mr. gumb's back

               as he continues his rummaging.

                                     mr. gumb
                         no, nothing at all. has the fbi 
                         learned something? because the police 
                         here don't seem to have the first 
                         clue...

               out of the folds of his kimono crawls a death's-head moth. 
               it creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.

                                     mr. gumb
                         do you have his description yet, or 
                         some fingerprints...?

               clarice

               unaware, is still glancing around the room. for several 
               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but 
               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. a beat of 
               pure fear. a tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.

                                     clarice
                         no... no, we don't.

               very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, 
               lowers the bag to the floor. with her fingertips she brushes 
               back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape.

               mr. gumb

               turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business 
               card.

                                     mr. gumb
                         ahhh. here's that number.

               clarice

               keeps her distance. they are about ten feet apart.

                                     clarice
                         good, thank you. mr. gordon, do you 
                         have a phone i can use?

               mr. gumb

               is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind 
               him, flutters past his face. he turns, looking at it. he 
               looks back at clarice, his mouth still open.

               her eyes

               are unmoving, locked on his.

               his eyes

               stare back at her, widen. and they know each other.

                                     mr. gumb
                              (softly)
                         in the kitchen. i'll show you.

               clarice

               whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.

                                     clarice
                         freeze!

               mr. gumb

               slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her.

               clarice

               tries to force more authority into her voice.

                                     clarice
                         okay... okay, mr. gumb, you're under 
                         arrest. down on the floor, hands and 
                         legs spread, move it.

               mr. gumb

               turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, 
               disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen.

               clarice

               hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - 
               and then it's too late.

                                     clarice
                         shit!

                                                                    cut to:
