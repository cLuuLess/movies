               ext. back steps of the funeral home - day

               clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. 
               she looks up wanly as lamar appears, offers her a can of 
               coke.

                                     clarice
                         thanks, i'm not thirsty.

                                     lamar
                         no, hold it under your chin, there, 
                         and on your temples. cold'll make 
                         you feel better. it does me.

               she smiles, touched, and takes the can. when lamar sees 
               crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. crawford sits 
               beside her; there's a brief silence. she soothes herself 
               with the can.

                                     crawford
                         when i told that sheriff we shouldn't 
                         talk in front of a woman, that really 
                         burned you, didn't it?
                              (she is silent)
                         that was just smoke, starling, i had 
                         to get rid of him. you did well in 
                         there.

                                     clarice
                         it matters, mr. crawford... other 
                         cops know who you are. they look at 
                         you to see how to act... it matters.

                                     crawford
                              (beat)
                         point taken.

               she looks at him a moment, then offers the can. he opens it.

                                     crawford
                         when we get back, i want you to run 
                         that bug by the smithsonian, see if 
                         they can identify it. maybe it's got 
                         some limited range, or it only breeds 
                         at certain times of year... you found 
                         it, starling, you deserve the credit.

                                     clarice
                         i'm wondering if he's done that before - 
                         placed a cocoon, or an insect. it 
                         would be easy to miss in an autopsy, 
                         especially with a floater... can we 
                         check back on that?

                                     crawford
                              (shakes his head)
                         the other girls are in the ground. 
                         exhumations are upsetting for the 
                         families. i'll do it if i have to,
                         but -

                                     clarice
                         then have the lab check raspail's 
                         head.
                              (he looks at her)
                         dr. lecter's patient - have them 
                         probe his soft-palette tissues... 
                         they'll find another cocoon.

                                     crawford
                         you seem pretty sure of that.

                                     clarice
                         raspail was killed by the same man 
                         who's killing these girls. and lecter 
                         knows him. maybe even treated him... 
                         you think so, too, don't you? or 
                         you'd never have sent me to that 
                         asylum.

               he looks at her for a moment, then sips again.

                                     crawford
                         before we caught him, lecter had a 
                         big psychiatric practice in baltimore. 
                         but he traveled all over the country - 
                         teaching, consulting... christ, even 
                         testifying in murder trials. who 
                         knows how many potential psychos he 
                         turned loose, just for the fun of 
                         it...?

                                                               dissolve to:
