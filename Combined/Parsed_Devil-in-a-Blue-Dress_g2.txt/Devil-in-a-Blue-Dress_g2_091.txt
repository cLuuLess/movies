138   ext. easy's house - day                                       138

      a newspaper headline reads: "carter back in race."

      the subheading reads: "quiet civic leader returns as
      flamboyant teran quits."

                                easy (v.o.)
                   the paper treated the mysterious
                   flip-flop like it happened every
                   day. and i could tell that matthew
                   teran wouldn't spend a day in
                   jail... back in the second section
                   of the paper was a small article
                   about an unidentified man found
                   dead, slumped over the steering
                   wheel of a white cadillac just
                   north of malibu...

      further back, we see that odell is reading the newspaper,
      nursing a can of ale.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   it scared me to think about a world
                   that could kill a man like dewitt
                   albright... what could a world like
                   that do to me?

                                odell
                   hey, easy, where's your car?

      easy looks up from pulling weeds.

                                                         117.

                   up a little.

                   yeah. man can't get no decent job
                   in this town without a car.

                   shoot.   i ain't studyin' no job.

                                odell
                   ain't thinkin' 'bout no job?   how
                   you gonna live?

                                easy
                   i'm gonna go to work for myself.
                   take a little money i got saved up
                   and go into real estate... start
                   fixin' up folks' gardens again...
                   and do a few favors on the side...
                   favors for friends.

                                odell
                   what you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'?

                                easy
                   well, like a woman offered me
                   thirty dollars to go track down her
                   husband for her.

                                odell
                   you talkin' about private
                   investigatin' or somethin'... you
                   could get in trouble doin' that.

      easy keeps working.

                                easy
                   like a man once said to me, odell:
                   'walk out your door in the morning
                   and you're already in trouble'...
                   it's just how you're mixed up in
                   that trouble that counts.

      easy gets up and turns on the water hose.

                                easy
                         (continuing)
                   odell?

                                 odell
                   yeah, easy...

                                                             118.

138   continued:   (2)                                               138

                                easy
                   if you got a friend that does bad
                   and you still keep him as your
                   friend, even though you know what
                   he's like... do you think that's
                   right?

                                odell
                   all you got is your friends,
                   easy...

      easy starts to nod, but then spots

      the woodcutter

      hovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the
      street, his shears ready to cut.

                                easy
                         (calling out)
                   get out of that yard!
                         (to odell)
                   bastard cut down two of my trees.

      easy picks up a rock and sails it. odell comes off the
      porch and does the same. then a neighbor from across the
      street joins in.

      the woodcutter ambles off toward another block, leaving
      easy, odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the
      street.

139   up the block                                                   139

      a man with a pony is setting up a camera. a few children
      have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of
      the neighborhood.

      the man props up a hand-painted sign, "cowboy pictures -- 15
      cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony
      positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head.

140   back to scene                                                  140

      another neighbor joins easy and company, and they continue
      to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at
      friends in passing cars.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   i thought about what odell had said
                   about friends and it made sense to
                   me...
                                (more)

                                                             119.

                                easy (v.o.) (cont'd)
                   odell goes to church every sunday,
                   so he would know... later on, he
                   challenged me to a game of
                   dominoes. and what'd he do that
                   for? we got to talkin' 'bout texas
                   and fooled around and drunk almost
                   a quart of whiskey... and i forgot
                   about daphne monet, dewitt albright
                   and carter and them... and sat with
                   my friend, on my porch at my
                   house... and we laughed a long
                   time...
