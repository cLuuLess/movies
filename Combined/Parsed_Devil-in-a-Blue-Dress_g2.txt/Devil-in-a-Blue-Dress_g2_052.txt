     easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open. he's tired, and
     he trudges up the walkway to the porch. he sees

     the woodcutter standing on the front lawn of the next door
     neighbor's, waving at him.

                                                               71.

     back to easy

     he throws a rock and then unlocks the door. but he notices
     the pot of african violets lying broken on the cement. he
     looks up just in time to see a two-by-four swing down.
     bonk! and easy is seeing stars.

     a big man, dressed in black, kicks open the door and drives
     easy head first into
