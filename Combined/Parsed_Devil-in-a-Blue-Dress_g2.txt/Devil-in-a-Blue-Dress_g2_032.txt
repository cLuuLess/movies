40   ext. l.a. city jail - night                                     40

     easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his
     top shirt button, his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep
     out the chill of the night air.

     the street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley
     except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the
     curb. a taut-faced officer leans out the window.

                              officer
                 hey, buddy!... it's a long walk...
                 why don't you let us give you a
                 ride?

     easy walks across the street off into the darkness...
