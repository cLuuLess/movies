41   ext. fourth street bridge - night                               41

     a snatch of music and laughter startles easy as he trudges
     home and a car full of teenagers shoots by. and then...

     a black cadillac limousine

     cruises up behind and drives alongside.

                               voice from car
                 hey, you!   ezekiel rawlins!

     the window rolls down all the way and a white face in a
     black cap appears in the window.

                              chauffeur
                 ezekiel, hold on.

     easy keeps walking.

                              chauffeur
                 come on, fella. somebody in the
                 back wants to talk to you.

                              easy
                 i don't have time right now.

     he doubles his pace, almost running.

                              chauffeur
                 jump in. we'll take you.    my boss
                 wants to talk to you.

     easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the
     other side of the bridge but

                                                               41.

41   continued:                                                      41

     the cadillac whips a u-turn blocking his way in the middle
     of the street while cars pass, honking, on either side. the
     tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his
     hands as if making peace.

     easy starts to make another move to escape but:

                               chauffeur
                        (continuing)
                  come on. if we wanted to hurt you
                  it would have already happened...

     he opens the back door and after a few moments, easy gets
     in.
