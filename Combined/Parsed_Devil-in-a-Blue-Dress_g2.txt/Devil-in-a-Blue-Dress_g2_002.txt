3   ext. joppy's bar - day                                           3

    black and grey cars, packards and buicks from 1928 to 1948,
    come and go on central avenue. two-storied storefronts with
    canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in
    a hurry.

    the red car rumbles through and then a white cadillac
    convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop.

    above the shop on the next floor are large partly open
    windows with joppy's bar in boldface letters. inside sits
    easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.
