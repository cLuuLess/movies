87   int. easy's house                                              87

     miller looks around suspiciously. the room still shows
     signs of the struggle with frank green. he exchanges a look
     with mason.

                               miller
                  been having a party, ezekiel?

     mason pushes easy into the chair and miller plants his foot
     on the seat between easy's legs and leans in.

                               mason
                  you got a lotta cuts and bruises to
                  be an ordinary working stiff.

                                                             77.

87   continued:                                                    87

                               miller
                  it's looking worse and worse for
                  you, my friend. what do you know
                  about richard mcgee?

                               easy
                  who?

     on the other side of the room mason picks up a chunk of the
     broken lamp from the fight.

                               miller
                  a dead white man in a cabin in
                  laurel canyon.

     mason comes over and stands over easy next to his partner.
     he fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp,
     threatening.

                               mason
                  he hangs out with some of those
                  same nigger friends of yours down
                  on central avenue.

     easy eyes the sharp edge, making up his mind to kill this
     fat son-of-a-bitch if he gets too creative, and die with
     him.

                               miller
                  he just happened to have a note in
                  his pocket with 'c. james' written
                  on it.

     he holds the slip of paper up for easy to see.

                               mason
                  any of this making you feel
                  talkative at all, 'cause i'll bet
                  ya six bits to a bottle of piss
                  that we're looking at a double
                  here... all we need is to place you
                  in the dead man's house.

                               easy
                  i ain't been there.

                               miller
                  where?

                               easy
                  i ain't been in no dead man's
                  house.

     miller stands back and pats his pockets for a smoke.

                                                              78.

87   continued:   (2)                                               87

                               miller
                  how 'bout a smoke, ezekiel?

     easy taps out one and miller places it in his mouth.

                                 miller
                  got a light?

     easy pulls out his lighter and sparks the flame.

                                 miller
                  may i?

     easy shrugs and passes the lighter to miller who fires
     himself up.

                               miller
                  nice lighter...

     he holds the lighter out of mason who wraps it up in a
     handkerchief.

                               miller
                  and we got our print.

                               easy
                  what do you mean?

                               mason
                  oh, hadn't you heard? we found a
                  cigarette lighter in the dead man's
                  house with the killer's
                  fingerprints on it.

                               easy
                        (total disbelief)
                  naw, man. i didn't do it.

                               mason
                  course you did, we got evidence.

                               easy
                        (frantic)
                  i didn't do it. you know i
                  didn't...

     and miller leans in hard.

                               miller
                  we know that you know more than
                  you're lettin' on. and now a white
                  man's been killed.
                               (more)

                                                                79.

87   continued:   (3)                                                 87

                               miller (cont'd)
                  now you better tell us what you
                  know, or you're goin' down for the
                  murder of richard mcgee and coretta
                  james.

     he straightens up and easy stands up, too.

                               easy
                        (shouting)
                  i don't know nothin'.

                               miller
                        (to mason)
                  put the cuffs on. let's take him
                  down.

     as mason reaches for the cuffs, easy sees mouse peek out
     from the kitchen doorway then disappear inside.

                                 easy
                  uh, listen!    i don't know who did
                  it!

                                 miller
                  but we do...

     he sees mouse draw his gun, his eyes trained on miller's
     back.

                               mason
                  and that's all that counts.

                               easy
                  dammit, i didn't do it.

                               miller
                  tell it to the d.a.

     mouse is trained with the hammer cocked and easy is about to
     give the signal, but then:

                               easy
                  look, gimme some time to find out.

                                 miller
                  forget it.

                               easy
                  gimme till tomorrow... tomorrow
                  mornin'...

     miller thinks about it and then--

                                                                 80.

87    continued:   (4)                                                  87

                                 miller
                   okay.   tomorrow morning, that's it.

      he nods to mason and easy looks up to see mouse raise the
      gun and slide back into the kitchen.

      mason unlocks the cuffs.

                                mason
                   have a nice evening, ezekiel.

      and he and miller walk out.

      easy looks out the doorway watching

a88   easy's pov                                                       a88

      miller and mason

      get in their squad car and drive away.

      back to scene

b88   he turns back to see mouse standing in the living room.          b88

                                easy
                         (wearily)
                   i guess you know what would have
                   happened if you had shot them two
                   cops in my house?

                                mouse
                         (shrugging)
                   hell yeah. they'd be dead.

      easy shakes his head.

                                easy
                   come on, let's go.

      he grabs a jacket.

88-91 omit                                                         88-91

a92   ext. easy's house - day                                          a92

      easy hurries out of his house pulling on his jacket with
      mouse right behind.

                                mouse
                   what they tryin' to pin on you?

                                                                 81.

a92   continued:                                                       a92

                                easy
                   i'll tell you on the way.   you got
                   the keys?

                                 mouse
                   yeah.

      and he hurries around to the driver's side.

                                easy
                   before we run out to compton we got
                   one other place to stop by...

      he freezes seeing the woodcutter watching and listening.

                                easy
                         (to woodcutter)
                   man, don't you mess with my trees
                   while i'm gone.

      he gets in as mouse cranks the engine.

                                 easy
                   you heard me.   leave my trees
                   alone.

      as mouse starts away the old man smiles mischievously and
      starts to sharpen his axe.

      easy leans out the car window, yelling back as the car pulls
      away.

                                easy
                   i mean it now. don't you mess with
                   my trees!!
