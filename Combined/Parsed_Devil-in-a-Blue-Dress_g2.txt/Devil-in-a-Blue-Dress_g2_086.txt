      easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette, rubbing his aching
      chin, looking out at

      daphne and carter

      standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium. carter
      wanders after daphne, explaining while she paces back and
      forth in anger.

                                easy
                   i could tell how it was gonna go
                   when carter asked us to meet him at
                   the observatory instead of at his
                   house... she knew it, too. but she
                   had come this far and she had to
                   play it out.

      suddenly, daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back
      toward the car. carter follows behind.

                                 carter
                   daphne!   daphne, sweetheart!

      he starts over, too, but then stops, knowing here's no use.
