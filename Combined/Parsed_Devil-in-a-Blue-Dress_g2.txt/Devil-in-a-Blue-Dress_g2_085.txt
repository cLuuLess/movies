128    ext. platform - night                                             128

       a few people hurry to board the train, easy and mouse among
       them.

                                 easy (v.o.)
                    i convinced mouse to take the two
                    o'clock train to pomona and to let
                    me handle everything else. he
                    could get a train back to houston
                    later that morning... he was fine
                    with that but only because he was
                    seven thousand dollars richer.
                    daphne had gotten the money out of
                    a locker at the ymca without a
                    word...
                                 (more)

                                                                111.

128   continued:                                                       128

                                easy (v.o.) (cont'd)
                   because she was still in shock and
                   couldn't really talk... maybe too
                   because she had stolen about four
                   times that much from carter.

                                mouse
                   listen, if you think you gonna have
                   trouble with that dude frank, i can
                   run by and kill him and take that
                   evening train to houston.

                                 easy
                   naw, man.

      he has had enough of mouse for a while.

                                 mouse
                   oh.   this is for you.

      and he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag
      from his coat.

                                mouse
                   i cut you in for half 'cause i knew
                   you was too big a fool to take your
                   share from that white girl
                   yourself.

      easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it.

      the conductor gets on board and the train starts making
      those metal on metal sounds.

                                mouse
                   send my grip to etta mae. i'm
                   gonna see if she'll take me back
                   now that i'm flush.

      he slaps easy on the shoulder and boards the train.

                                mouse
                   oh, here's the keys to dupree's
                   car.

      he tosses them, and the train starts moving.

                                mouse
                   and if you need somebody to run
                   them streets with ya, gimme a call.
                   you know how to put some money in a
                   nigga's pocket.

      and he laughs, flashing gold teeth pulling away.

                                                             112.

128   continued:   (2)                                               128

      easy watches.

                                easy (v.o.)
                   i knew i would see him again and i
                   didn't know how i felt about
                   that... 'cause, unlike mouse, my
                   legs were like rubber... the way
                   they had been in the war the whole
                   two years i was there.
