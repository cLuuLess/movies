                   shit!   damn!

      he whacks the nightstand with the receiver, dying with
      frustration. and something moves in the dark. he lunges
      and grabs

      daphne monet

      and pulls her into the light, then sits down onto the bed
      before the shock can knock him down.

                                daphne
                   are you all right?

      to touch the bump on his forehead.

      daphne stiffens, as if from an electrical shock, and then:

                         (continuing)
                   was she being too nosy? or was she
                   just being coretta and trying to

                   killed a woman over some pictures
                   of another rich white man.

      she gathers herself, just as:

                   number please...

      she looks away, worn out, tired.

                                daphne
                   we have different fathers. mine is
                   white... frank doesn't even know
                   that todd and i broke up. so far
                   i've kept him out of all this.

      she gets up and takes easy's cigarettes and taps one out.

                                daphne
                   see, coretta's the only one out
                   here in l.a. besides my brother who
                   knew about me...
                         (she lights up)
                   and about a month ago she took a
                   job working for, of all people,
                   matthew teran. she made friends
                   with one of the girls in the office
                   who told her that she'd heard that
                   teran was a pedophile. and coretta
                   got carried away and told her that
                   todd carter was engaged to a
                   colored woman. she was sorry and
                   didn't think it would get to
                   teran... but it did and he got a
                   hold of my birth records.

                                easy
                   who killed her, daphne?

      daphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face
      ignoring the question.

                                daphne
                         (continuing)
                   todd and i broke up and i paid a
                   guy for the pictures of teran. but
                   somehow coretta got them.

                                easy
                   who killed her?

                                 daphne
                   it was an accident. coretta and i
                   were still mad at each other. i
                   mean, she threatened to sell teran
                   the pictures.

                                easy
                   who killed her goddammit!?

                                                              97.

                   i just asked joppy to go over and
                   put a scare in her... it was an
                   accident.
