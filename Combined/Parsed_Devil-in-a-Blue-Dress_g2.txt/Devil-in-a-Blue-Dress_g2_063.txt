98   int. dupree's sister's house - kitchen - dusk                    98

     dupree's face under the kitchen light shows two swollen
     black eyes from a brutal police "questioning." his eyes are
     heavy with liquor and tears glisten down his cheeks.

                               dupree
                  why somebody wanna kill her like
                  that? why?

                               easy
                  i don't know, dupree... i don't
                  know...

                                                                88.

98   continued:                                                       98

     dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of
     mouse, who swallows half the shot without looking up from
     his plate of food.

     easy declines when the bottle comes his way, feeling the
     pressure of time running out.

                               easy
                  did coretta ever say anything to
                  you about a letter she was keeping?

                                dupree
                  letter?   what kinda letter?

                               easy
                  for that white girl...

                               dupree
                  naw. but i know it was on account
                  of her that coretta got killed.

     easy rears back in his chair with keen interest and mouse
     looks up from his pigtails.

     dupree takes a drink and his eyes narrow in anger.

                               dupree
                        (continuing)
                  everything between coretta and that
                  daphne was always such a damn
                  secret... i mean that ole girl
                  didn't think nothin' about two-
                  timin' on frank... she probably
                  'innerduced' coretta to one of them
                  ole guys she knew... and when he
                  came to the house after coretta...
                        (starting to break)
                  ...he found out she wasn't that
                  kinda woman... cops said she fought
                  him... aw my gawd... fought him
                  'cause she wouldn't have nobody but
                  me-e-e...

     he buries his face into his hands and easy throws a sad but
     frustrated look to mouse.

                               dupree
                        (continuing)
                  aw gawd, i can't even go to
                  sleep... 'cause i can still see her
                  face that mornin' 'fore i went to
                  work...
                               (more)

                                                                89.

98    continued:   (2)                                                 98

                                dupree (cont'd)
                   junior had been by and just left
                   the house... and she came runnin'
                   out to the car carrying her
                   bible... and she said, 'keep this
                   for me, baby.'

      easy and mouse exchange looks.   jackpot!   and dupree falls
      apart.

                                dupree
                         (continuing)
                   police won't even let me go near
                   her house. so it's the only thing
                   i got left from her. it was a
                   sign... i know it was a sign,
                   'cause she was so religious...

                                mouse
                   it's all right, big man... it's all
                   right...

      and he pours dupree a half glass of rye.

99    the bottle - later, night                                        99

      barely a "corner" of whiskey lies at the bottom and

      dupree is snoring like a buzzsaw, sound asleep.

      mouse squints into his glass, wondering why it's empty, and
      looks down the length of the kitchen leading into

100   the bedroom - night                                             100

      drawers are pulled out on the dresser, and easy is rifling
      through another until he pulls out a bible. he fans the
      pages, finding

      the letter

      already opened.    his fingers pull out a photograph and then
      two more.

      back to easy

      his excited face goes sick, and he silently mouths:

                                easy
                   holy shi-it...

                                                                 90.

100   continued:                                                       100

                                easy (v.o.)
                   i was as nauseated from fear as i
                   was from what i saw... pictures of
                   a much younger matthew teran and
                   children... innocent, helpless,
                   naked children...

101   kitchen                                                          101

      easy hurries in holding up the letter.

                                easy
                   i got it. come on, i think that
                   girl is gonna call again.

                                mouse
                   that dupree is a good man, but he
                   sure can't hold his liquor.

      easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on,
      stuffing the letter in his coat pocket.

                                 easy
                   you got your sails up pretty far
                   too, raymond.

                                mouse
                   you callin' me drunk?

                                easy
                   well, you been puttin' it away
                   along with him and--

                                mouse
                   if i was drunk could i do this?

      and in less than a heartbeat he has pulled that long-
      barreled pistol and is aiming it at easy's forehead.

                                mouse
                   ain't a man in texas can outdraw
                   me!

                                easy
                         (forced calm)
                   put it down.

                                mouse
                   go on.

      and he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster.

                                                              91.

101   continued:                                                    101

                                mouse
                   go for your gun. let's see who
                   gets kilt.

                                 easy
                   i don't have a gun, raymond.   come
                   on, let's go.

                                mouse
                   you fool enough to go without a
                   piece then you must wanna be dead.

      he lays the pistol on the table then draws a .32 automatic
      from his waist, this time cocking the hammer, the muzzle
      only inches from easy's head.

      easy can tell from the glazed look in mouse's eye that
      instead of seeing him, his friend is glaring at some demon
      he carries around in his head. so he stands stock still.

                                easy
                         (quiet, soothing)
                   let him go, raymond... he done
                   learned his lesson. if you kill
                   him then he won't have got it.

                                mouse
                   he fool enough to call me out and
                   he ain't even got no gun? i'll
                   kill the motherfucker.

                                easy
                   let him live, raymond, and he be
                   scared whenever you walk in the
                   room.

                                mouse
                   motherfucker better be scared. i
                   kill a motherfucker. i kill him!

      easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment
      until mouse blinks, then nods and lets the pistol fall down
      into his lap. his head on his chest, he's sound asleep.

      easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other.
      then walks to the doorway and turns out the light.
