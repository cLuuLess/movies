48   int. motel room                                                  48

     it's a regular drab, cheap motel that she has given a warmer
     touch with colorful scarves draped over the two lamps.

                               daphne
                  would you like a drink?

     she indicates a pint of scotch on the dresser with an empty
     glass and one that she's been drinking from.

                                 easy
                  no, thanks.

     she indicates the chair.

                               daphne
                  please sit down.

     she's wearing a blue dress that's plain, cutting just below
     her knee with a ceramic pin just over her left breast.

                                                             47.

                               daphne
                  what happened to you?   have you
                  been fighting?

     easy stubs out his cigarette in an ashtray and sits down.

                               easy
                  why don't you just tell me what you
                  want?

     she sits down too, her calm but brittle exterior betrayed at
     the hands. she stops wringing them when she sees that he
     notices and takes a drink -- more medicine than pleasure.

                               daphne
                  i should be asking you that
                  question. why have you been asking
                  about me?

                               easy
                  i heard about you. fellas at
                  john's said you were something to
                  see.

                                daphne
                  so...?   you've found me.

                               easy
                  uh... yeah... guess i have. but
                  you got a boyfriend i don't want no
                  part of... frank green.

     she lights a cigarette.

                               daphne
                  you can stop pretending, mr.
                  rawlins. i know someone hired you
                  to look for me. in fact i had to
                  pay coretta not to tell you where i
                  was... you know how coretta is...
                        (forces a weak smile)
                  she told me you two became 'good
                  friends' yesterday...
                        (tears gather in her
                         eyes)
                  i talked to her this morning before
                  she died.
                        (regaining control)
                  i... uh... need to go across town
                  to see someone. it's very
                  important... i can't seem to reach
                  him by phone. i'm afraid i'd
                  better have someone go with me.

                                                                48.

                               easy
                  uh... miss monet--

                               daphne
                  call me daphne.

                               easy
                  daphne--

                               daphne
                  i can understand why you'd be
                  nervous... because i threatened you
                  with coretta... i'm very sorry, but
                  i couldn't think of any other way
                  to get you to come.

     she takes another drink and stubs out her cigarette though
     it's less than a third gone.

                               easy
                  i can't -- why don't you ask frank?

     she gets up and starts to pace nervously about the room.

                               daphne
                  he's out of town -- i... i'm
                  willing to pay you.

                               easy
                  that's nice of you but, see, i'm
                  not really a detective--

                               daphne
                  --i know that.

                               easy
                  i was just hired to ask around to
                  try to find you for a man--

                               daphne
                  i know all about that, mr. rawlins.

                               easy
                  but this is a gettin' a little out of
                  hand--

                               daphne
                  --mr. rawlins--

                               easy
                  --easy.

                                                               49.

48   continued:   (3)                                                48

                               daphne
                  easy... if you don't help me, then
                  i'll call the police and tell them
                  that you were with coretta before
                  she died and that you've been after
                  me too.

     that stops easy.

                               easy
                  you'd do that?

                                 daphne
                  yes, i would.    i don't want to but
                  i would.

     she hates herself for threatening and decides to change
     direction, moving in close.

                               daphne
                  please let me pay you.

                                 easy
                  no.    i can't do that.

                                 daphne
                  why?

                               easy
                  i don't want no part of all this.

                               daphne
                  please, i'll pay you twenty
                  dollars.

                                 easy
                  no dice.

                               daphne
                  thirty... or even more.    name your
                  price.

     she moves in closer, massaging with her voice.

                               daphne
                        (continuing)
                  go ahead. there's gotta be
                  something that you want.

     her eyes make an offer, but he's a better man than me and
     he's not taking.

                                                              50.

                               daphne
                        (angrily,
                         sarcastically)
                  what? are you afraid i'll yell
                  rape or something?

     she walks away and turns up her glass, her desperation, raw,
     unguarded.

                               easy
                  uh, miss monet... daphne, i'm sorry
                  but i really better be goin'.

     he starts out and she runs to stop him.

                               daphne
                  easy, don't touch that door--

     he opens it and

     scream!   like an alarm, she's shrieking all of the scale.

49   he looks out and sees                                          49

     lights going on in other rooms.

50   back to scene                                                  50

     he looks back frantically and grabs her by the shoulders.

                               easy
                  crazy assed broad!   what the hell
                  are you doing?!

                               daphne
                  i'm really very sorry.   i really
                  am.

     she pulls on a coat and grabs her purse.

                               daphne
                        (continuing)
                  i didn't want to do this but...
                  shall we?

     she grabs an already packed suitcase and is out the door.
