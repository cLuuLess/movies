      compton looks a lot like texas, with unpaved streets and
      little country-styled houses set back away from the road
      behind vegetable gardens and chicken coops and small sheds
      with a horse or a cow tied up.

                                                                87.

     easy and mouse pull into    the gravel driveway of a little
     house and are met by the    usual barking dog you find in the
     country -- part spaniel,    part shepherd, and some kind of
     retriever. it dogs easy     and mouse's heels as they get out
     of the car.
