68   ext. carter foundation patio                                   68

     an elderly secretary descends an outdoor curved stairway
     carrying a file. she spots easy looking around confused and
     immediately becomes annoyed.

                              secretary
                 may i help you?

                               easy
                 uh... yes.   i came to see mr.
                 carter.

                              secretary
                 do you have an appointment?

                                easy
                 no, i don't.

                              secretary
                 well, i'm sorry, but mr. carter is
                 a very busy man.

     easy pulls out albright's business card and hands it to her.

                              easy
                 well, tell him mr. albright sent
                 me, and it's real important.

     she looks at the card and then up at easy with annoyed
     superiority.

                              secretary
                 may i ask the nature of your call,
                 mister...?

                              easy
                 rawlins. but i'm not so sure he'd
                 want me to tell you.

                              secretary
                 i'm quite sure, mr. rawlins, that
                 whatever you know is nothing i
                 can't know as well.

                              easy
                 okay. well, anyway, tell him i'm
                 here with information about that
                 little chippy of his that dumped
                 him.

                              secretary
                 is this some sort of joke?

                              o.s. voice
                 uh... excuse me...

                                                             64.

68   continued:                                                     68

     easy and the secretary turn to see a tall man in a dark grey
     suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in
     the doorway. he forces a smile and comes out.

                               baxter
                  mr. rawlins was it?

     he holds out his hand and easy shakes it.

                                easy
                  yes.   mister...

                               baxter
                  baxter.
                        (to the secretary)
                  i'll take care of this.
                        (and back to easy)
                  why don't you come with me, sir?

     they walk through the door into

69   a hallway                                                      69

                               baxter
                  not very smart talking about mr.
                  carter's business to a secretary.

                               easy
                  i don't wanna hear it, man. it's
                  too much goin' on for me to give a
                  damn about what you think is smart.

     baxter bristles up and slows down his walk, about to put
     easy in his place. but easy slows down too and squares up
     on him. baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone
     staircase.
