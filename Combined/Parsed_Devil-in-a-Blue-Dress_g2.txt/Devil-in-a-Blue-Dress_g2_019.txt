23   int. coretta's house                                          23

     coretta pushes the door open and easy hauls him in.

                                coretta
                   throw him in there on the bed,
                   easy.

     easy pulls and pushes dupree's dead weight into

     the bedroom

                                coretta
                   throwed him outta his place, 'cause
                   he couldn't pay the rent. i
                   shouldn't even let him sleep here.

     finally easy manages to pile dupree onto the bed and then
     stands up panting and sweating.

                                easy
                   damn...

     coretta leads him out into

24   the living room                                               24

                                easy
                   i need a cigarette.

     coretta shines her hazel eyes on him.

                                coretta
                   that all you need?

     easy grins nervously and clears his throat.

                                easy
                   coretta, sun catch me tip-toein'
                   out your door and no tellin' what
                   your neighbors say...

                                                              24.

24   continued:                                                     24

                               coretta
                  dupree run through his money, fall
                  asleep on me. and you just gonna
                  walk out on me like i was dog
                  food...

                               easy
                  you got a man in the other room...
                  why don't you tell me 'bout your
                  friend daphne?

     coretta strolls up to easy, pressing her body against his.

                               coretta
                  why you keep askin' 'bout her?
                  colored women ain't good enough for
                  you no more?

     she undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest, and
     unbuttons another working her way down. easy sweats harder
     than when he was lifting dupree.

                               easy
                  what if he hears somethin'?

                               coretta (o.s.)
                  way he snorin'?

     on the sofa - minutes later

                               coretta
                  oh yeah, daddy. you hittin' my
                  spot! oh yeah... yeah!

     the top of her dress undone, coretta is straddling easy who
     is hitting her spot and his too, in a rhythm. eyes
     closed, he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to
     awaken dupree, who is sawing logs -- shredding 'em -- in the
     bedroom.

     suddenly coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on
     his knees. easy writhes and shakes like a power line
     shorting out.

                               coretta
                        (coy, shy)
                  oooh, that's just too good, easy.

     easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the
     floor.

                               coretta
                  i can't give up that much love,
                  daddy, not the way things is.

                                                             25.

24   continued:   (2)                                               24

                               easy
                        (out loud)
                  what things?

     she shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the
     bedroom.

                               coretta
                  you know, dupree's right there in
                  the next room.

                               easy
                        (full voice)
                  forget about him! you got me
                  goin', coretta!

     coretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses.

                               coretta
                  but it ain't right, easy. here i
                  am doin' this right in the next
                  room and all you doin' is nosin'
                  after my friend daphne...

                               easy
                  daphne?
                        (and then remembers)
                  oh, yeah... i ain't after her,
                  baby. that's just a job.

                               coretta
                  what job?

                               easy
                  man wants me to find her.

                               coretta
                  what man?

                               easy
                  who cares, what man?   i don't want
                  nobody but you...

     he pulls her toward him but she pushes him away.

                               coretta
                  but daphne's my friend--

     frustrated, he sits back against the sofa and coretta,
     sensing that he is snapping out of her spell, slides forward
     onto him giving him her spot again. and within moments
     they are back at it.

                                                                26.

24   continued:   (3)                                                 24

                              coretta
                  oh, baby. oh, daddy, you hittin'
                  my spot! oh, yeah...

                               easy (v.o.)
                  i went on hittin' her spot until
                  just before sun-up.

                                                dissolve to:
