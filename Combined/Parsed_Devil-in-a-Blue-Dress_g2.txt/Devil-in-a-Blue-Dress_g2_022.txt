     golden morning light streams in through the window.
     outside, a dog is barking at a bird on the fence.

     coffee percolates on the stove and easy walks over and pours
     himself a cup. he moves to the breakfast table and sits
     down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens
     up a blue envelope in a stack of mail.

     gradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up,
     his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading
     aloud.

                               easy
                  "since etta mae has left me and i
                  am a bachelor i figured i could
                  come out and visit and we burn down
                  the town...
