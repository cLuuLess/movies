4   int. joppy's bar                                                 4

    t-bone walker's "westside baby" plays on the jukebox as easy
    takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out.

    the front page of the los angeles times lies face up on the
    table beneath the ashtray displaying a photograph of a
    middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion
    smiling and waving.

    above the happy couple is a headline "carter drops out of
    race"... the caption under the photo reads "wealthy civic
    leader, todd carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be,
    daphne monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for
    comment on his surprising withdrawal from the mayor's race."

                              o.s. voice
                 catch ya later, joppy.

    back to scene

    splack! an older black man hitching up his pants underneath
    a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer
    glass down hard on the counter on his way out.

                                                               4.

                              joppy
                 hey, watch the marble!   dammit,
                 what'd i tell you?

    the fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big
    stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top
    of the bar with a filthy rag. behind him is a yellow
    billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "fuller
    vs. shag. 10 round main event." we could make out more of
    the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around
    it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.

                              easy
                 joppy, how much they payin' out
                 there at mcdonell douglas?

                               joppy
                 i don't know.   don't it say--

    his words hang as his eyes stray toward the door.

    easy looks up also at

    the doorway which fills with the large frame of the white
    man in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the
    room. satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the
    tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at joppy and walks to
    the far end of the bar.

    easy is surprised to see joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he
    is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like
    he's answering a summons. the white man extends a friendly
    hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in
    close to talk in private.

    easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he
    takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks.
    after a moment...

                              joppy
                 easy, come on over here. this
                 here's somebody i want ya to
                 meet... come on. this here's a
                 friend of mine.

    easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over.

                               joppy
                 yeah, easy.   this here's mr.
                 albright.

                              albright
                 you can call me dewitt, easy.

                                                             5.

    he extends his hand and easy shakes it.

                              easy
                 how ya doin'?

                              joppy
                       (bowing and grinning)
                 mr. albright and me goes back to
                 before the war when i was still in
                 the fight game.

                              albright
                       (to easy)
                 ever seen this guy fight...? any
                 time joppy shag stepped in the ring
                 you knew you were gonna see some
                 real knock-down-drag-out-
                 fisticuffs... where you from, easy?

                              easy
                       (awkwardly)
                 houston.

                              albright
                 houston... joppy's hometown.

    joppy pours albright a straight shot of wild turkey and the
    big man sips it.

                              albright
                 so i hear you need a job.

    easy throws a look at joppy, but joppy is busy buffing the
    bar and putting more of easy's business in the street.

                              joppy
                 aw yeah, easy always tryin' to do
                 better. got his high school
                 certificate from night school.
                 he's threatenin' up on some
                 college. and he's one of the few
                 colored men around here who owns
                 his own house. shoot, he pays a
                 mortgage every month just like a
                 white man.

                              albright
                 property owner, hunh?

    he turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the
    counter.

                                                             6.

                              albright
                       (continuing)
                 these big companies, don't give a
                 damn, do they?

    he reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card
    and scribbles something on it.

                              albright
                       (continuing)
                 if you need a job, drop by this
                 address at seven tonight.

    easy takes the card and glances at it.

                              easy
                 what kind of work you do?

                              albright
                 i do favors... i do favors for
                 friends. drop by.

    he nods to joppy and walks out the door.

                              easy
                 who the hell is that, joppy?

                              joppy
                 just somebody i know... a bidness
                 man.

                              easy
                 what kinda business?

                              joppy
                 oh, i don't ask him all that. he
                 comes in here every so often
                 looking for somebody to do a little
                 job for him... he pays good.

                              easy
                 in other words, he's a gangster.

                              joppy
                 i didn't say that... but if there's
                 a dollar laying in the street i
                 don't think he'll let a little dirt
                 stop him from picking it up. if
                 you worried about making that house
                 note this month, maybe you wanna
                 pay him a call. all them pretty
                 girls you be with ain't gonna buy
                 you a house.

                                                                7.

    easy cocks his head "are you crazy?"

                              joppy
                       (continuing)
                 sound like he just wants you to
                 keep your eyes open for somebody...
                 he'll pay you whether you see
                 anything or not... if it was me i'd
                 take that man's money and go on
                 about my bidness... ain't nothin'
                 to worry about.

    easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the
    card.

                              easy (v.o.)
                 when somebody tells me "don't
                 worry," i usually look down to see
                 if my fly is open... i noticed
                 albright didn't bother to pay for
                 his drink.
