     easy opens the door and stands on the porch.

                               mouse
                  hey, easy, was it a left on
                  richland or a right?

                                                             76.

                  a right. and if dupree ain't over
                  there in compton, just come on back
                  'cause i might have heard from the
                  girl.

     just then a car cruises around the corner and easy watches
     mason and miller pull up across the street and get out. he
     glances over at mouse.
