     on his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a
     single, bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum
     floor.

     he crawls to one of the urine-stained corners, and looks down
     on a dry, flat corpse of a mouse. he pushes his shoulder
     against the unpainted plaster until he's standing and then
     stumbles over to the chair and sits. he looks up at the
     bare pipes that run along the ceiling, dripping water, and
     at a window with criss-cross chairs instead of glass framing,
     overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in.

     the door opens and miller comes in first carrying a
     notebook.

                               miller
                  ezekiel rawlins.

                               easy
                  yes, sir.

     mason follows and closes the door.

                               miller
                  we can take off the cuffs if you
                  wanna cooperate.

                                                              37.

                               easy
                  i'm cooperating.

     miller motions to mason and he removes the cuffs.

                               miller
                  where were you this morning at
                  about five a.m.?

                               easy
                        (stalling)
                  what do you mean?

                               mason
                  he means--

     he plants his foot in easy's chest and pushes him over
     backwards.

                               mason
                  --this morning.

     easy has caught himself and stands back up.

                               easy
                  i don't know... i was out drinkin'
                  and i helped carry a friend home.
                  i could've been on my way home... i
                  don't know... i didn't look at a
                  clock...

                               mason
                        (wandering over)
                  he didn't look at a clock.

     whock! easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep
     his balance, wiping away blood streaming down.

                               miller
                  you were drinkin' down on eighty-
                  ninth and central... at an illegal
                  club called john's, weren't you?

     mason moves again but this time easy turns to face him and
     the fat man looks back with an innocent face, his palms
     turned up.

                               miller
                  you may as well answer 'cause you
                  got bigger troubles than us bustin'
                  an illegal bar, ezekiel.

                               easy
                  what do you mean?    what's goin' on?

                                                             38.

     mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the
     palm of his hand.

                               mason
                  means we can take your black ass
                  out behind the station and put a
                  bullet in your head.

                               miller
                  now. what time did you leave
                  coretta james' house this morning?

                               easy
                  i guess about five... five-
                  thirty...

     miller and mason glance at each other, and mason kicks the
     chair over toward easy.

                                mason
                  sit down.

                               easy
                  why, i'm gonna sit down and you
                  keep trying to knock me down?

     but he sits down anyway.

                               miller
                  did you go back and see miss james
                  later in the day?

                                easy
                  no, sir.

                               miller
                  did you and dupree brouchard have
                  words over miss james?

                                easy
                  huh?

                               mason
                  you heard 'im. did you two argue
                  over coretta james?

                                easy
                  naw.   he was asleep.

                               miller
                  she went to sleep too, ezekiel.
                  but she won't be waking up...

     easy's face goes sick...

                                                               39.

                                miller
                        (continuing)
                  where'd you go when you left miss
                  james' house?

     easy is too stunned to answer.

                               mason
                  you heard him, where'd you go?

     easy stares into space, answering in barely a whisper.

                               easy
                  i went home with a hangover...

     choonk! choonk! mason fires off two punches and easy grabs
     his wrists and pulls him down to the floor, swinging around,
     straddling mason sitting on his ass...

     miller's police special presses into easy's temple and
     miller speaks to him quietly, deadly.

                               miller
                  get up slow... real fuckin' slow or
                  you know what's gonna happen.

     easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet, backing away
     cautiously.

     mason is winded and furious.

                                mason
                  okay.   let's take him out back.

     he gets to his feet and reaches for his gun, but miller
     stops his hand.

                                miller
                  no.   let's go.

                               mason
                  bullshit, i'm gonna blow his--

                                miller
                  let's go!

     he pushes mason toward the door.

                               mason
                  son-of-a-bitch! son-of-a-bitch!

     they exit the door and easy rubs at his bloody ear.

                                                               40.
