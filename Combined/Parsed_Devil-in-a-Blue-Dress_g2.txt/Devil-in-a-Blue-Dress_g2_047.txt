60   int. easy's house                                                  60

     he pushes open the door. shariff loiters just inside,
     grinning at him, and manny stands in the middle of the
     living room looking at the floor. from a radio in another
     room tommy dorsey plays "blue skies" with frank sinatra out
     front. and so easy walks past the two hoods into

     the kitchen

     albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a
     porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand.

                                albright
                   easy.

     easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at
     albright, smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in
     the same clothes he had on at the pier.

                                easy
                   what you doin' in my house, man?

                                albright
                   i expected you to be home, so manny
                   used a screwdriver on the door.
                   what happened to your face?

                                                               55.

60   continued:                                                      60

                               easy
                  you got no excuse to be breakin'
                  into my house -- what if i broke
                  into your place?

                               albright
                        (still smiling)
                  i'd tear your nigger head out by
                  its root.

     easy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour
     himself a cup of coffee.

                               easy
                  so what do you want?

                               albright
                  where have you been this time of
                  morning, easy?

                               easy
                  i went to see a girl. don't you
                  get none, mr. albright?

     the smile leaves albright's face and his eyes turn even
     colder.

                               albright
                  i didn't come here to play, boy.
                  you got my money in your pocket and
                  we've been over at that address
                  waitin' all night for frank green
                  and now we've found out that he
                  moved from there over a year ago.

     easy is scared and confused but he plays it off.

                               easy
                  so what do you want me to do about
                  it? you don't think i did my job.
                  shit, i give you the money back.

     and he reaches for his pocket, but albright reaches too --
     and suddenly, manny and shariff are in the room and on easy
     like a vice. albright presses the barrel of the .45 against
     easy's forehead.

                               albright
                  do you believe in god, easy?
                  'cause i'm curious to see if death
                  is any different for a religious
                  man.

     easy looks down, away from the gun, and swallows hard.

                                                               56.

60   continued:   (2)                                                60

                                easy
                  i seen her.

     after a moment, everyone relaxes and easy sags out from
     under their grip and staggers into

61   the living room                                                 61

     manny and shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair
     and albright stalks in holstering his gun.

                                albright
                  where?

                               easy
                  she called me. had me drive up to
                  the hollywood hills.

                               albright
                  how'd she know about you?

                               easy
                  i guess coretta... the girl that
                  told me about daphne and frank
                  green.

                               albright
                  why didn't you call me?

                               easy
                  i couldn't. she threatened to tell
                  the cops that i had killed
                  coretta...

     albright looks over at his henchmen.

                                albright
                  where is she?

                                easy
                  she took off.

                                albright
                        (dangerously)
                  where is she?

                               easy
                  i don't know! while i was looking
                  at the body she split.

                               albright
                        (nodding)
                  uh-hunh.

                                                                57.

61   continued:                                                       61

     albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the
     corners, but he is not surprised to hear about a body.

                               albright
                  you call the cops?

                               easy
                  i tried my best to keep in the
                  speed limit. that's all i did.

                               albright
                  what'd she do, take his car?

                                easy
                  hunh?

                                albright
                  mcgee.   did she take his car?

     easy hesitates, "how did albright know his name?"

                                easy
                  uh... yeah...

                               albright
                  where'd you pick her up at?

                               easy
                  she left that place--

                               albright
                  --write it down!

     to his shame easy flinches and gets paper from his end
     table, then scribbles down the address and hands it to
     albright who takes easy's seat and examines the note.

                               albright
                  get me some whiskey, easy.

     easy studies albright who sits knees wide apart, now the
     master of the house, and he can't help himself.

                               easy
                  get it yourself... bottle's in the
                  cabinet.

     albright looks up and easy braces himself for albright to
     bring on the end, all at once. but slowly a smile spreads
     across albright's face and he laughs, stamping his foot.

                                                             58.

61   continued:   (2)                                               61

                               albright
                  well, i'll be damned. get us a
                  drink, manny... easy, you're a
                  brave man. i need a brave man
                  working for me... but you gotta
                  find frank green, so he can lead us
                  to her.

                               easy
                  no, thanks, mr. albright. people
                  are gettin' killed all around me...
                  you never said anything about all
                  this...

                               albright
                  easy, you're connectable to two
                  murders. you'll do whatever i tell
                  you to do.

     manny brings albright's drink and the captain turns it up
     and gives manny back the glass.

                                albright
                         (continuing)
                  now you got three days to find him.
                  and you make sure you count 'em
                  right.

     he walks out the screen door with manny and shariff
     following.

62   kitchen                                                        62

     easy grabs the bottle from the counter, where manny has left
     it, and pours himself a stiff one. but he only stares into
     the glass.
