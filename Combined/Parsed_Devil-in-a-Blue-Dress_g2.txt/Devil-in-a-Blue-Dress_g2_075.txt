115    int. car - industrial street - night                           115

                                 easy
                          (to joppy)
                    you sure 'bout this place?

                                 joppy
                    i guess so. he's done this kinda
                    thing out there before.

                                 mouse
                    easy, what's done got into you?
                    thought y'all was friends.

                                 easy
                    he killed dupree's girlfriend.

                                  mouse
                    you lyin'.

                                  easy
                    naw.

                                 mouse
                    son-of-a-bitch!

       and he pulls out his pistol, aiming it back over the seat at
       joppy as he drives. kablaam! the bullet slams through the
       rear window just to the side of joppy's head.

                                  easy
                    mouse!   what're you doin'?

       kablaam! this one digs out a chunk of upholstery between
       joppy and easy.

                                  easy
                    hey!   watch out!

       the car screeches to a halt and mouse tries to aim again.
       but easy struggles with mouse's gun hand still holding a
       pistol on joppy.

                                 easy
                    mouse, we need him to lead the way!

       kablaam!   this one rips through the roof.

       joppy's yelling, afraid that easy's gun will go off.

                                                             104.

                   mouse, the girl offered me seven
                   thousand dollars for the pictures.

      mouse glares into the rearview mirror.

                                 mouse
                   you lyin'!

                                easy

                                 mouse
                   aw shit!

      and he fumbles with the ignition and shifts gears.

                                mouse
                   oh, my god!... oh, my goodness!
