     baxter ushers easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more
     closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched
     doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda
     overlooking a canyon.

     alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside
     is todd carter.

     baxter walks out and speaks with carter, while easy watches
     them from inside the office. the rich man perks up with
     interest and hurries inside with baxter who throws easy a
     dirty look on his way out. he pauses uncertainly wearing a
     simple sears roebuck-looking tan suit with a plain open-
     collared white shirt. the dark circles under his eyes show
     nights without sleep.

                                                             65.

                  mr. rawlins.

     he runs a hand through his thinning red hair, and offers an
     overstuffed sofa. they sit on either end.

                               carter
                        (distraught)
                  has something happened to daphne?

                               easy
                  the last time i saw her she looked
                  fine.

                                 carter
                  you saw her?

                                easy
                  yeah.   last night.

                               carter
                  she's still in town?

                               easy
                  she was last night.

                               carter
                  what did she say -- what was she
                  wearing?

                                 easy
                  a blue dress.    blue heels.

                               carter
                  and a pin on her chest?

                               easy
                  yeah, on the left side.

                                carter
                         (carried away)
                  oh yes, that's her. that's her.
                  you know i've never known a woman
                  who could wear perfume so slight
                  that--

                               easy
                  --mr. carter, mr. carter--

                               carter
                  what did she say? what did she
                  say?... oh, i'm sorry. brandy?

                                                             66.

     he points to a crystal decanter near easy. easy pours
     himself a drink and takes in carter as he wrings his hands
     to keep from going to pieces. this guy's got it bad.

                                easy
                  mr. carter. i came here to get
                  some answers.

                               carter
                  yes...?

                               easy
                  i don't know... i'm takin' a
                  helluva chance...

     carter runs his hand through his hair again, the suspense
     killing him.

                               easy
                        (continuing)
                  i guess it's just that when i'm
                  working for somebody, i wanna know
                  what i'm gettin' myself into...

     carter leans in as if he missed something.

                               carter
                  i beg your pardon.

                               easy
                  well, i'd like to know the real
                  reason why mr. albright hired me.

                                carter
                        (after a moment)
                  mr. albright?

                              easy
                  yeah. the man you hired to find
                  daphne.

                               carter
                  there must be some mistake... i'm
                  sorry, busy... who are you talking
                  about?

     easy and carter stare at each other, not sure how to
     proceed.

                               easy
                  you didn't hire somebody to find
                  your girlfriend?

                                                                67.

                               carter
                  no... until just now i was sure
                  that she was hundreds of miles away
                  from here... you say someone is
                  looking for her?

     easy nods, his brow furrowed in thought. carter gets up and
     walks to the door, looking out into the canyon.

                               carter
                        (half to himself)
                  someone is looking for her.

                               easy
                  what's goin' on between you two?

     carter shrugs and stammers nervously.

                               carter
                  uh... i don't know... we were going
                  to be married... we had a fight...
                        (then recovering)
                  uh... that's none of your concern,
                  mr. rawlins.

     he stops and looks to the floor, the gravity pulling him
     down... way down.

                               carter
                        (continuing)

                  albright? and he said he's working
                  for me?

                               easy
                  yeah... do you know a man named
                  richard mcgee?

                               carter
                  no... i can't say that i do.

                               easy
                  why would someone be after her, mr.
                  carter?

                               carter
                  uh... i can't say -- i don't
                  know...

     he's lying and easy knows it.

                  do you think you could find her

                  i don't know.

                               carter
                  it's important, mr. rawlins, for
                  her sake... i'm willing to pay you.

                               easy
                  mr. carter, why did she leave?

                  i can't tell you any more mr.

                  now.

                               carter
                  mr. rawlins. i think you're trying
                  to take advantage of me. but left
                  me inform you that the incumbent
                  mayor and the chief of police eat
                  at my house regularly.

                                easy
                  good.   then they can help us--

                                carter
                  --no.   they can't!

     carter is too emphatic and easy waits for him to give more,
     but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon.

                               baxter

                   why is matthew teran looking for

                   so albright was working for matthew
                   teran. and whatever teran had on
                   carter was strong stuff... too
                   strong even for carter to go to the
                   police... but because teran was
                   desperate to find the girl too,
                   that gave me the best hand. i had
                   seen her once, and if i played it
                   right, i'd see her again.
