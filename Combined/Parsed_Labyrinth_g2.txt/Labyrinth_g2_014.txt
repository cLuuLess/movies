14	int: foyer - night

sarah's hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she
unfastens it and opens the door. zakar enters and extends his hand.

zakar: it is an honour, miss williams. i understand you make a
delightful queen meander.

sarah: well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know?

zakar: i was passing through this part of the country and heard that
it was going to be done here. this is the first amateur production of
the play, which of course is delightful for me.

sarah: you know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.
the firemen had to use the hall.

zakar: yes, i know, that's why i wanted to stop by to see you.

they are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. and
then freddie begins to howl.

sarah: that's my brother ...

there is another crash and sarah starts up the stairs.

sarah: i'll be right back!

zakar watches her run up the stairs. he glances around and then walks
right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.
