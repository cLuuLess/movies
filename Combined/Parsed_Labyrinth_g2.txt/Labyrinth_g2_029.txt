29	int: corridor 3 - day

sarah and hoggle appear through the wall and sarah laughs with
delight. hoggle wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels the
wall as if testing to see if it really happened. sarah sees that they
are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to
the top of one and looks over.

another angle

sarah's pov - the turrets of the castle

sarah (excited): i can see the castle! it doesn't look far at all!

hoggle is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how
they got there. sarah jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.

sarah: come on, hoggle. let's go!

hoggle sees her retreating figure and hurries after her.
