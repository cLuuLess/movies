hoggle is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.
sarah comes rushing toward him.

sarah: oh, i'm so glad you're still here! they were horrible ...

hoggle: you don't mean the false alarms, do ya?

he shakes his head and goes off in the direction that sarah just came
from.

hoggle: if ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, missy, ya
haven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle.

sarah quickly follows.

sarah: false alarms?
