86	int: castle - night

jareth's quarters, where didymus tends hoggle and ludo still blocks
the door.

jareth (vo) (whiney scream): why does everything have to happen to me!

they look at each other and suddenly ludo realizes that the goblins
are no longer trying to break down the door. the three start to laugh.

hoggle (proudly): she did it!

they cheer.
