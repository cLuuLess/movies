15	int: nursery - night

freddie in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. sarah rushes in
and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is
crashing against the wall. she rushes to close it. freddie's screams
are piteous.

sarah: oh, freddie ...

there is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened
room.

zakar (vo): perhaps i can soothe him ...

sarah gasps and whirls around. zakar is framed in the doorway. he has
a drink in his hand. sarah holds the baby close.

sarah: you shouldn't be up here!

zakar (smoothly): i just wanted to help ...

sarah rushes by him, still clutching the baby.
