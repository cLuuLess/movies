72	ext: goblin town - night

sarah, ludo and didymus emerge into the vast courtyard outside the
castle. it in eerily quiet. too quiet.

sarah: we're going to make it!

didymus sniffs the air.

didymus: i am less than sure ...

they are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a goblin jumps on
ludo's back. then the courtyard is filled with goblins, what seems
like the whole army, coming right at them. didymus fends off the
vanguard party with his sword and ludo punches out the ones that get
by him. didymus unswords a goblin and his weapon goes flying. sarah
picks it up and does some parrying of her own. but there are too many
of them. the threesome turn and run.
