67	int: sarah's room - night

sarah is drowning in a sea of junk. she hears didymus and cries out
hopefully.

sarah: didymus, in here! help me!

the door opens and the junk woman peers inside.

junk woman: don't worry, dearie. i sent 'im away!

sarah groans.

junk woman: knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for
no rescue mission.

sarah: oh my god! freddie!

junk woman: freddie? is that one of them dolls over there ... or that
nice teddy?

sarah struggles for the door in the sea of junk.

sarah: no! he's my brother! and i've got to save him!

she continues pushing through the junk.

junk woman: no you don't, dearie. you can stay right 'ere with all
your pretty fings ...

sarah knows what her choice has to be.

sarah: i know i can. (joyous) but i don't want to!

she lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in
the doorway. she looks down at the junk woman triumphantly.

sarah: now get out of my way!
