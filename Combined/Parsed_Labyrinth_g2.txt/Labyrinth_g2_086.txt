87	int: jareth's chambers - night

jareth, the bratty little goblin, is throwing a tantrum.

jareth: nobody ever cares about what i want!

the walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a
crack opens up right in front of sarah's feet. she looks at the clock
and the minute hand moves to the 13. she looks at freddie. there's
nothing to do but jump into the void. the clock begins to strike.

sarah: ok, freddie. time to go bye-bye!

she jumps.
