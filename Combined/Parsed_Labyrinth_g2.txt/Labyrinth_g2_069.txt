69	ext: castle gate - night

ludo and didymus sit forlornly at the gate. sarah appears out of the
night.

didymus: my lady!

ludo leaps to his feet.

ludo: sarah ... safe!

sarah rushes into his arms.

didymus: is hoggle not with you?

sarah pulls away from ludo.

sarah: hoggle made his choice, he's ... not part of the mission
anymore.

didymus (angry): the coward!

ludo: hoggle ... good!

sarah shrugs, and smiles at him.

sarah: maybe. but there's no time to discuss it. we've got a baby to
rescue, remember!

she leads them through the gates.
