hoggle is more depressed than ever. the peach is nowhere to be seen.
suddenly ludo's head appears above.

ludo: hoggle ... all ... wet.

hoggle almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged.

hoggle: ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a
thinkin' creature!

sarah appears from behind ludo.

sarah: be nice, hoggle. or we won't get you out.

hoggle's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten.

hoggle: missy!
