4	ext: the other side of the trees - day

sarah comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward
the street. we pull back and we can see an enormous steel mill on the
other side of the river. and now we notice that the light isn't pink
any more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a
suburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary
place.
