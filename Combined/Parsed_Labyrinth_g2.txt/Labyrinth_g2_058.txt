58	ext junk city - night

sarah runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. there
are piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents
from which people hawk objects of all kinds. some of them approach
sarah and she pushes them away, sobbing.

another angle

sarah's pov - a red tent, and standing in front of it is an old woman
stooped over from the objects piled high on her back. she beckons to
sarah and pulls the tent flap aside.

junk woman: 'ere it is, dearie. all the fings you want, all the fings
you need.

another angle

the flap opens wider and inside the tent we can see sarah's room!

another angle

sarah gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. she trips
over the threshold and lands face down on her bed.
