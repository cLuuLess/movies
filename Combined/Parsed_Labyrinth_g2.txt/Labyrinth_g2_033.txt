freddie is now sitting on the lap of a goblin, happily bopping it on
the nose. jareth snaps his fingers and a group of sleepy musicians in
the corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. they
begin to play and jareth looks out the window and begins a song. he
sings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is
to others -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.
