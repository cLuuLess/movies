9	int: nursery - night

sarah enters freddie's room. she searches the nursery.

sarah: nobody listens to a thing i say.

she opens a toy box and rifles through it.

sarah: how many times have i told them to stay out of my room ...

she gets to the crib and looks down. freddie is wide awake, gurgling
at lancelot, sarah's tattered old teddy bear.

sarah: and you, you can just give me back my bear!

she yanks it out of the crib and leaves. freddie looks hurt and his
face starts to cloud up.
