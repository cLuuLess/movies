53	int: castle - night

freddie is leading the goblins on a merry chase. he crawls around the
room, pulling things off shelves. a goblin is on his hands and knees
in front of jareth polishing his boots. jareth kicks the goblin and
sends him flying across the room. this makes freddie laugh and he
pulls a book off the shelf and throws it. it hits a goblin on the
head. jareth scoops up freddie and puts him in his cradle. he sits
down next to him.

jareth: little goblin-to-be, i have something to amuse you.

he waves his hands in front of freddie and suddenly beautiful
crystalline balls appear in them. he runs them over his fingers like
so many coins, their molten light so dazzling that freddie kicks up
his legs with excitement. and we can see that at the end of his
pajamas are two wizened goblin feet! jareth laughs and flings the
balls into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing
bubbles.

jareth: soon, little one. very, very soon ...

and they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over
the labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.
