70	ext: goblin town - night

streets full of hovels encircle the castle. this is where the goblins
live. as sarah, ludo and hoggle walk through the dark, eerie streets
they are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of
lights.

didymus: methinks they are expecting us, my lady.

a child goblin peers at them from an open doorway. a female goblin
sees him and drags him inside and slams the door.

sarah (grimly): methinks you're right!
