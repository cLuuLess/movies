71	int: tavern - night

hoggle is still at it. he pulls his belt off his body and we see that
the only treasure left is sarah's plastic circlet. he slowly pulls it
off and stares at it. the bartender approaches, his eyes lighting up
at the eight of this treasure.

bartender: another?

hoggle hesitates, then hands the circlet over. the bartender bites it
and his face lights up with glee.

bartender: plastic!

he goes to get the drink and hoggle puts his face down on the bar and
sobs.

another angle

at the other end of the bar sits the wise one. the hat looks over at
hoggle and shakes his head knowingly.

hat: drinkin' to forget, eh, buddy?

hoggle looks up.

wise one: to forget, ah yes. to suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate
from one's consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to
drink the waters of lethe ...

hoggle (drunkenly): what's lethe ...

wise one: the waters of forgetfulness. they remove from our minds
what is too painful to remember ...

hoggle looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand.

wise one: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that
which brings us understanding, also enlightenment ...

but there is no one to continue benefitting from the wise one's
pearls. hoggle is gone.

hat: you can cool it down there ... he's gone ...

wise one: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ...

the hat sighs and looks over at the bartender who is still admiring
his plastic treasure.

hat: another one over here ... and make it a double ...
