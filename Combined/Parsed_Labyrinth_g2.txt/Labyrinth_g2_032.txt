32	ext: corridor 4 - day

sarah and hoggle are striding down a corridor. they are about to come
to a corner.

sarah: are you sure jareth can turn freddie into a goblin? i mean,
that's really weird ...

they turn the corner and hoggle stops short. sarah becomes alarmed.

sarah: what is it?

hoggle gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he
hears -- marching. they look back the way they came.

another angle

sarah's and hoggle's pov - a battalion of armed goblins, marching
right towards them!

another angle

they look at each other, then turn and run. hoggle tries to get
through the wall the way the worm showed them.

hoggle (quoting the worm): just forget what you think you know and ...

he smacks headlong into the wall. he stops to rub his nose and sarah
flies by him.

sarah: come on!
