91	int: sarah's room - night

sarah stands in the doorway looking down at freddie.

sarah (softly): that's quite a journey you took, freddie.

freddie looks up at her and makes a sound. he continues straining,
and we see that what he is reaching for is lancelot, sarah's bear.
sarah smiles, and lifts freddie up. she sits on the bed, freddie on
her lap, and hands him the bear.

sarah: here. it's yours.

freddie takes it happily.

sarah (smiling): you earned it.

she kisses his head and rocks him gently. then she gazes out the
window at the stars.
