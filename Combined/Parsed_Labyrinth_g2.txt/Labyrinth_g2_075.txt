75	ext: street - night

they come careening around a corner and it seems that they have
escaped their pursuers. the sound of the goblins seems to be getting
farther away.

sarah: i think we lost them.

they turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and
are right back in the courtyard. ludo climbs part way up a wall and
looks over the streets.

didymus: what do you see, my brother?

ludo gulps. what he sees is the goblin army coming down every street
right towards them.

ludo: ludo ... see ... trouble!

and then the trouble arrives and sarah and didymus are heavily into
swordplay. ludo tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by
goblins who prick at him with their spears. sarah looks up and sees
his predicament. she gets an idea.

sarah: call the rocks, ludo! call the rocks!

ludo makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall.

he then throws his head back and bellows.
