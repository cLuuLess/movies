24	int: corridor 1 - day

the corridor of faces. hoggle enters and the faces start in on their
routine. sarah comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.

face 1: this is the path of no return!

face 2: beware! beware!

hoggle: just ignore 'em.

sarah: are you sure?

hoggle sighs and turns to the next face.

face 3: abandon all hope ...

hoggle: oh, shut up, will ya?

sarah is wide-eyed at hoggle's defiance.

face 3: but i was just getting to the best part!

hoggle: all right. but don't expect us to pay any attention.

face 3 (winks at sarah): you're going to love this ... abandon all
hope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!

hoggle (bored): very nice ...

sarah is dumbstruck. hoggle takes her hand and yanks her along.

face 3: come back any time ... i mean, you're doomed, doomed!
