66	ext: junk city - night

didymus and ludo approach the red tent. they spy the junk woman.

didymus: did you see a noble maiden pass this way?

junk woman: a noble maiden, eh? what would she be doin' in a place
like this?

didymus: she's on a rescue mission ...

the junk woman finds this hilarious.

junk woman: a rescue mission, ha! you're in the wrong place, for
sure! the only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our
worldly goods!

she takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for
emphasis.
