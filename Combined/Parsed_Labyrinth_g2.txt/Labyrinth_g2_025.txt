25	int: corridor 2 - day

hoggle and sarah continuing down a similar corridor.

hoggle: ya see, things aren't always what they appear to be around
here, missy ...

sarah (shrugging): whatever. all i'm interested in is getting my
brother back from that creep.

she starts to look around for something.

hoggle: i admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beat
jareth.

sarah picks up a rock.

sarah: well, maybe i'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth
business.

she takes the rock and uses it to mark an x on the floor.

sarah: see, now i'll know which way we came in case i get lost.

hoggle (sighs): missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer the
course around here, what ya want to do is go forward.

sarah: look, hoggle! i've got to find freddie and i don't need you to
discourage me!

hoggle: and i don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around in
circles with you!

sarah: that's fine with me! (she starts off) i know you're only after
my ring, anyway!

she turns a corner and hoggle looks after her, hurt and pity crossing
his face. he takes a few steps in her direction and an officious
little creature, a brickkeeper, emerges from the brickwork of the
floor, takes out the cobblestone that sarah marked, and replaces it
with the marked side hidden. it looks up at hoggle.

brickkeeper: some people got no respect for property!

hoggle sticks his tongue out at the creature just as it goes back
into its hole.
