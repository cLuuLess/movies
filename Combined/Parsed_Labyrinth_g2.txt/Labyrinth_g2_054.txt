sarah's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the
ground. she stares out into the sky, mesmerized. the bubbles are
approaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. and then she hears music,

that each one contains a twirling dancer, a dancer just like the one
in sarah's music box. she gets up and follows them.

another angle

a bubble, with sarah inside it, floating through the sky. she appears
enchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the other dancers.
