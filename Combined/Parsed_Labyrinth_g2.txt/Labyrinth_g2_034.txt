34	int: maze montage - day

while jareth sings, sarah and hoggle try to escape from the goblins.
they get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with
crumbling walls. they scamper up to get a look at their position and
see dust rising from several parts of the maze. the goblins are
everywhere.

in another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by dozens of
little fuzzy creatures who scurry towards them out of the way of the
oncoming goblins. they turn and run back the way they came and as
they do wall creatures chatter nervously and then disappear into the
cracks between the bricks.

in a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of
spears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.

they enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming
small, intermittent bridges. thinking they are safe, they stop for a
breath, and soon realize that a battalion is right behind them. they
scurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie
across an arch hopefully out of sight of the goblins below.
