16	int: hallway - night

sarah comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. zakar
follows. freddie is still crying.

sarah: maybe you'd better leave ...

she gets to the bottom of the stairs. freddie whimpers. zakar is
making her very nervous.

sarah: ... i, uh, don't think i care to talk to you about the play.

he is right behind her, almost too close.

zakar: neither do i.

sarah is shocked and disturbed by this.

sarah: what!

zakar reaches over and smoothes freddie's hair.

zakar: i'm more concerned about the baby, of course.

sarah pulls freddie out of his reach.

sarah: freddie's just fine.

but he isn't. he's still crying. zakar reaches into his pocket and
pulls out a coin. be runs it over his fingers right in front of
freddie's face. the baby stops crying.

zakar: there, isn't that better?

sarah (nervously): uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...

zakar ignores her and heads into the living room.

zakar: i'm not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in
here and i'll do some other tricks for him ...

sarah: no! you've got to ...

but he is already in the living room. she follows, still holding the
baby.
