6	int: inside the rouse - evening

sarah bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the
stairs. she almost makes it. sarah's mother appears in the hallway.

mother: _sarah_, where have you been?!!!

sarah abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension
of the stairs.

sarah (in an affected voice): i can't talk to you now. i'm in
rehearsal.

she continues grandly on and heads for her room.

mother: you were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for
freddie! don't we at least deserve an explanation?

sarah stops and leans over the railing. she speaks with a
melodramatic solemnity.

sarah: as meander's queen, i've been ... meandering. dither me not
about explanations.

with that she turns and heads for her room. on the door is a sign
that says: "admittance by invitation only." sarah's father comes into
the hall.

father: what's that all about?

mother: it's a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that's no
reason to...

sarah turns in her doorway. she calls down.

sarah: chasten not your queen, _peasant_!

she dramatically sweeps into her room.
