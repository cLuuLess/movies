18	int: foyer - night

it's worse in here! the goblins are pouring down the stairs, some
slide down the bannister! sarah tries running into another room, but
is soon back, followed by a dozen more! she barely makes it to the
front door and struggles to open it with the baby in her arms. the
goblins pull her back and laugh wildly. they fling her right into
jareth's arms. he scoops freddie up and whirls away from her. sarah
tries to grab the baby back but the goblins get between them.

sarah (hysterical): give him back, you monster! give him back!

jareth only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. freddie laughs
with delight and sarah struggles to reach him. with a superhuman
effort she pushes through the mass of creatures and grabs onto
jareth's fluttering cloak. it's like being caught up in a whirlwind
of incredible force.

sarah (screaming): i ... won't ... let ... you ... take ... him!

but it's too late. sarah's feet leave the ground and she is pulled
with them and the whole mass of goblins. jareth and freddie swirl up
through where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.
there's a quick montage of shots: jareth's laughing face; sarah,
desperate as her fingers are losing their grip; freddie, who's having
a great time; goblins, all gleeful; then -- jareth's garment pulls
out of sarah's grip. she falls out of frame, a silent scream on her
face.
