63	int: sarah's room - night

sarah clams the door again and rushes over to the window. a group of
revellers peer in at her and laugh. she quickly pulls the curtains
closed and walks back to the center of the room. she stands clutching
the bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.

another angle

sarah's reflection. herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy
bear.

old sarah: best to stay in here where it's safe. don't know what
might happen to you out there.

sarah steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea
of mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her. as
she tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her
and pull her down.

sarah: help! somebody help me!
