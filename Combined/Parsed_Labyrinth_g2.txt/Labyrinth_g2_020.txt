another part of the wall. hoggle pushes a bush aside and shows sarah
a tiny door. she looks at it dubiously.

hoggle: this'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of the
labyrinth ...

sarah: the first part! what comes after that?

hoggle gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door.

hoggle: then there's the garden maze, then the forbidden forest ...

sarah: that sounds inviting ...

he is through the door. he is still talking but sarah can't hear him.
she quickly tries to follow.

sarah: wait! wait! i can't hear you ...
