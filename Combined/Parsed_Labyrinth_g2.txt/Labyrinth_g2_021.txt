21	int: labyrinth - day

hoggle is through the door.

hoggle: ... then comes the castle ...

sarah's head appears.

hoggle: ... that's surely where jareth's keepin' the babe ...

he looks down at sarah, she is through the door to her waist and
straining to get the rest of herself through. hoggle sighs and grabs
her hand. with a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the
doorway. she lands flat on her face.

hoggle: ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya?

he chuckles and sarah gives him a look that could kill as she gets up
and dusts herself off. she looks around and the environment seems
rather benign. the brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a
flower peeks through a crack.

sarah: oh, i think i can handle it. in fact, this place doesn't seem
so bad at all.

and with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor.
