77	ext: courtyard - night

sarah and didymus fight bravely. ludo keeps bellowing and throwing
off the occasional goblin that is stupid enough to jump on him. soon
the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the
threesome and their attackers. ludo reaches down and lifts sarah and
didymus on to the wall. they jump and disappear into the castle
enclave.
