the main entrance to the castle. two-goblin guards stand outside the
large wooden doors. the results of the threesome's escape can be
heard in the distance. a figure staggers out of the dark, singing
drunkenly. it is hoggle.

hoggle: " ... it's so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm
... "

he trips over his feet as he approaches the guard.

guard: who goes there?

hoggle " ... so cold, oh so cold ... "

guard 2: don't worry about him. he's on jareth's payroll now.

hoggle falls to the ground, then picks himself up.

hoggle: thash right. jareth owes me sumthin' ... an' i'm here ta
collect ...

they laugh at him, then step aside and let him enter.
