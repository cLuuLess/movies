35	int: arched corridor - day

sarah and hoggle huddle above the corridor on their arches as two
goblins bring up the rear.

goblin 1: i can kill better than you can.

goblin 2: but i'm better at maiming. everybody says so.

and they are gone. shaken, sarah and hoggle slide down from their
hiding places.

sarah: do you think they're gone?

hoggle: sure they are. goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, ya
know. they has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze as
you do.

he folds his arms and leans against the wall.

sarah: i'm not sure, but i think you just called me stupid ...

suddenly hoggle yells and disappears. he has accidentally leaned on
another secret wall opening. sarah quickly follows.
