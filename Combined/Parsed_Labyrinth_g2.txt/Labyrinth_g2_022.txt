22	int: corridor 1 - day

sarah turns a corner and comes face to face with a face. it is huge
and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.

face: go back! go back before it's too late!

sarah screams and backs away from it, moving further down the
corridor. she backs into something and whirls around. it is another
face.

face 2: turn back while you still can!!

sarah turns and runs back the way she came.

sarah: hoggle!
