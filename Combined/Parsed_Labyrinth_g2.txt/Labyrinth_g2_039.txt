39	int : hedge maze - day

sarah and hoggle have been walking through the maze a long time. they
are tired and bedraggled. sarah pulls the watch out of her pocket and
sighs.

sarah: an hour's gone by and i don't think we're more than four feet
from where we started.

hoggle: that's 'cause ya won't do what i tells ya. it's clear as day
we should be goin' this way ...

he turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. he howls in
pain and sarah sighs and follows him.

another angle

hoggle disentangling himself from the hedge.

sarah: got any more suggestions?

before hoggle can answer they are interrupted by a terrible
gut-wrenching scream. it is positively unearthly. sarah whirls around.

sarah: it sounds like it came from over there!

hoggle points in the opposite direction.

hoggle: then let's go this way.

sarah frowns at him as the scream begins again.

sarah: hoggle! it sounds like someone's being hurt!

hoggle: exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction!

sarah shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become
more unbearable.

another angle

sarah, running through the hedge maze. driven by the sound of the
screams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.
hoggle, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.

another angle

sarah emerging from the maze. she is stopped in her tracks by what
she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from
screaming. hoggle emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he
heads right back into the maze.
