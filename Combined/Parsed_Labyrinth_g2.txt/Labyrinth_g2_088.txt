89	int: nursery - night

sarah is lying face down on the floor. she comes to slowly and tries
to sit up. groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner
of the open drawer. she tries to focus, blinking her eyes.

another angle

sarah's pov - her eyes slowly focus on freddie's crib. when she can
see, she gasps. freddie's not there! the side of the crib is down and
the baby is nowhere to be seen.

sarah: freddie!

she leaps to her feet woozily. still rubbing her head she staggers
out into the hallway.
