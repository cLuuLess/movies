80	int: castle - night

a group of goblins stand in a circle in a corridor. they torment a
tiny, fuzzy yapping creature with their nipper sticks. the creature
gets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor. the goblins
laugh. it turns a corner and starts yapping for all it's worth.

another angle

sarah, ludo and didymus pressed against the wall, trying to not be
noticed. unfortunately the little creature has no sympathy for their
plight. it stands at their feet, making a ruckus.

sarah (whispering): shut up, you little monster!

ludo bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it.

ludo: nice ... thing ...

but the creature doesn't want a pet. it sinks its teeth into ludo's
hand. ludo howls.

didymus: i fear that this means trouble.

the goblins yell and start running down the corridor.

sarah: run for it!

they are off, the creature and the goblins at their heels.
