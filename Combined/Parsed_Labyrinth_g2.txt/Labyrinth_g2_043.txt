43	ext: forest gate - day

hoggle is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door
swings open.

hoggle: i'm coming ...

he rushes through the door and disappears. we can tell from his voice
that he is falling down a deep hole.

hoggle (echoed): ... miiiiiiiiissy!

we hear a huge splash. then that door shuts and ludo is all alone.

ludo: sarah ... gone. hoggle ... gone.

he is sad and confused. a figure emerges from the hedge maze and
begins to walk along the wall, away from ludo. it is the wise one.
ludo brightens and chases after them.

ludo: wait!

the wise one stops and the hat looks ludo up and down.

hat: this ought to be a good one!

ludo: ludo ... need ... door!

wise one: you have need of a door, do you? ah, yes. a very useful
thing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that
which gives access, a gate or gangway ...

he continues walking and ludo walks with him, listening intently.

wise one: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a
propylaeum ...

hat (sighs): if only i had hands i could cover my ears ... that is,
if i had ears ...

wise one: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...
