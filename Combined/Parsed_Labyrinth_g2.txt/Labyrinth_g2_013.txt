sarah's pov

through the door opening sarah can see a very elegantly dressed,
quite good-looking man of an indeterminate age. he has a worldly air,
or is it other-worldly? before he can speak a flash of lightning
illuminates his face. he is a mesmerizing sight and sarah can't help
but gawk.

man: excuse me, is this the home of sarah williams ... sarah
williams, the actress?

sarah's jaw drops.

sarah: that's me.

man: allow me to introduce myself ... (he holds out his hand) i'm
robin zaker.

sarah squeals with delight.

sarah: you wrote the play!

he smiles.

sarah: just a second.
