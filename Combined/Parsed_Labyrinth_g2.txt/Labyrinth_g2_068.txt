68	ext: junk city - night

sarah runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face.

the junk woman pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to
sarah.

junk woman: wait, dearie! look at this!

she holds out sarah's music box, opens it, and the little dancer
twirls inside.

sarah (grinning): keep it!

and she is off. as sarah goes the camera lingers on the junk woman.
and we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had
just seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very
different. where the other side of the woman should be we see a
cross-section of her, with jareth inside. his head is beneath the
pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. he is
the puppeteer operating the junk lady, as indeed, she has been
operated. jareth is mad.

jareth: damn.
