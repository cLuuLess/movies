     int. rear car - moving - day

     claire enters a little breathless.  spotting phelpís profile
     in the darkened car.

                          claire
                ethanís right behind me.  listen to me
                jim.  is it such a good idea to kill him?
                we take the money.  ethan takes the
                blame.  no-one else has seen you alive.
                no-one will believe him.

                          ethan
                of course - iím sorry to hear you say
                that claire.

                          claire
                ethan?

                          phelps
                yes.  ethan hunt, darling.  remember him?

     here phelps pulls out his assembled pistol.

                          claire
                you knew about jim?

                          phelps
                course he did.  just exactly when he knew
                is something of a question.  before or
                after i showed in london, mind telling
                me, ethan?

                          ethan
                before london.  but after you took the
                bible out of the drake hotel in chicago.

                          phelps
                they stamped it, didnít they?  those damn
                gideons.

     phelpís watch alarm goes off.

                          phelps
                two minutes til krieger shows.  thisíll
                have to be quicker than iíd like.
                certainly quicker than youíd like.

                          claire
                ethan, if you knew about jim?..why..

                          phelps
                why the masquerade?  why take the risk?
                well, claire, youíve asked the question
                and you are the answer.

                          ethan
                i knew about jim.

                          phelps
                but, he didnít know about you.  in all
                fairness, ethan, claire was never
                convinced her charms would work with you.
                but i was supremely confident - having
                tastes the goods.  "thou shall not covet
                thy neighbourís wife", ethan.  oh, ethan
                is in love with you, claire, make no
                mistake about it.  and like all the 
                worldís lovers, heís tortured by the
                same, one pathetic question - "does she
                feel the same way i do?"

     jim turns to claire.

                          phelps
                well claire do you?  have you been
                exploiting his feelings or returning
                them?

                          claire
                jim - lets just get the money and get out
                of here.

     claire goes to ethan.

                          claire (cont'd)
                the money ethan.

     ethan hands her the money.

                          ethan
                youíve earned it.

     claire goes to jim with the money.

                          phelps
                count it.

     claire starts to count.

                          ethan
                tell me something claire, that night in
                prague, was it you or jim that blew up
                the car and scattered hannah all over
                town?

                          phelps
                keep counting claire.

                          claire
                it was me.  i did it.

     claire hands phelps the money.


                          phelps
                satisfied?

                          claire
                all ten million.

                          phelps
                fold it.  fold it tight.

                          ethan
                arenít you going to thank me jim.  ten
                million is better than six.

                          phelps
                donít flatter yourself - six was for
                eastern europe.  you made a lousy deal -
                ten for the world?  what is that?  but i
                needed you for the transfer with max.  i
                got a little extra change;  and you got a
                little extra too.

     phelpís watch alarm goes off.

                          phelps
                sorry ethan.  times up.  say goodbye.

                          ethan
                youíre wrong about one thing.  iím not
                the only one whoís seen you alive.

     ethan throws jim the visco glasses.

                          kittridge
                good morning, mr phelps.

     phelps and claire are stunned.

                          phelps
                you son of a bitch.

     phelps points the gun at ethan.

                          claire
                donít jim.

                          phelps
                now we donít have to eliminate him?  you
                like that, donít you claire?  donít you?

                          claire
                yes.

                          ethan
                jim, itís over.

                          phelps
                ethan - iíve always taught you, nothing
                can be more dangerous than the truth.  it
                can kill you.

     phelps shoots claire.  struggle between phelps and ethan.
     the gun is lost.  phelps beats ethan to the ground.  his
     watch alarm beeps rapidly.  he turns, goes up the stairs
     and...

     ethan goes to claire.
                          
                          ethan
                claire...hey...

                          claire
                this stuff is so sticky.

                          ethan
                claire.

                          claire
                itís all right, ethan..youíll bring me
                back...wonít you...

                          ethan 
                i always have, claire.. 

     claire dies.  ethan looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder.
