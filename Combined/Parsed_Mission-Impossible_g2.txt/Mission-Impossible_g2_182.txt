     int. second class car - moving (another angle) - day

     kittridge and barnes move through the second class car.  they
     turn around and start working their way back again.

     at the front, claire is getting desperate.  a large man
     passes through the door behind her.

     the large man continues back, nearing kittridge and barnes,
     who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order
     to make room for him to pass.  as they move by him, their
     vision is momentarily blocked --

     -- and claire gets up to follow.

     she follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the
     door and out of the car, after kittridge and barnes talk in
     doorway.

                          barnes
                only four more cars.

                          kittridge
                and if we donít find him - weíll search
                the whole train again.

                          barnes
                whatís hunt doing on the tgv?

                          kittridge
                high speed train.  no-one gets on.  no-
                one gets off.  high security.  good place
                for a pass off to max.

                          barnes
                but why tell us?

                          kittridge
                heís putting on a show, barnes.

                          barnes
                what kind of show.

                          kittridge
                i donít know.
                     (looks at his wrist monitor)
                it didnít say on the tickets.

     kittridge and barnes go off back through the next coach.
     claire follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into
     her wristwatch to ethan:

                          claire
                ethan...kittridge is on the train.

                          ethan
                kittridge is job.  max delivered.  how
                far is he from luther?

                          claire
                two cars.  where are you?

                          ethan
                you are my eyes.  stay with him.

     she moves onto the next coach, going after kittridge and
     barnes.
