     int. safe house - prague - day 

     the imf team's safe house is a sparsely furnished prague 
     apartment with a panoramic view of the city. 

     the imf team is scattered around the room. sketches, pads, 
     overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. 
     jack and sarah seated next to each other - jack demonstrating 
     the visco glasses to her.  claire is seated opposite jack at 
     the computer.  jim and ethan are in the kitchen.  hannah 
     taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. 

                          jack 
                look to your right, then back to me. 
                there's a camera built right into the 
                bridge.  whatever you see it sees and 
                transmits it back here.  can you hear me?

                          sarah 
                of course i can hear you. 

                          jack 
                no, in your...ear piece. you have a 
                lovely smile (eyes). can you hear me 
                now? 

                          sarah 
                loud and clear. 

                          jack 
                what's going on? 

                          sarah 
                i don't know. 

                          jack 
                why don't you take a look? 

                          sarah 
                jack...that's spying. 

                          jack 
                that's what we do isn't it? 

                          sarah 
                jack you're so wicked. 

                          jack 
                too wicked to have a drink later? 

                          sarah 
                i think i might just take that look. 

     ethan and jim phelps are in a heated conversation. 

                          ethan 
                yeah, well, jim, fact is i've got more 
                than ninety days leave coming. 

                          phelps 
                a hundred and sixty-seven, i think it is. 
                take it all, if you want.  after this one. 

                          ethan 
                i thought i'd take some now. 

                          phelps
                     (quietly, to ethan) 
                what the hell's made you decide to take 
                your leave at the worst possible time? 
                claire's in a weird mood too. 

                          ethan 
                oh?  what's the problem? 

                          phelps 
                i don't know, i had to go to chicago 
                again.  you were in kiev.  you tell me. 

                          ethan 
                tell you what? 

                          phelps 
                when you started noticing your short term 
                memory loss.  what the problem was you 
                and claire had in kiev? 

                          ethan 
                what problem? 

                          phelps
                     (laughs)
                ah, god, forget it.  what are we talking
                burnout here?

                          ethan 
                i guess. 

                          phelps 
                ethan, you can't burn out. 

                          ethan
                why not? 

                          phelps 
                because i can't afford it. and because 
                you'd burn up before you'd burn out. 

     claire, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to 
     be the reference point in the following exchange: 

                          ethan 
                how was chicago? 

                          phelps 
                wonderful.  ran into a convention of auto 
                dealers at the drake hotel.  you hear the 
                one about the astronaut who comes back 
                from the first manned flight to mars 
                after two years?  his wife's got a year 
                old kid.  so he says "all right.  who was 
                it?  my friend harry?"  she says no. "oh,
                it was my friend sammy."  she says it 
                wasn't sammy.  "oh, i suppose it was my 
                friend lou."  "no, what's the matter, 
                don't you think i have any friends of my 
                own?!" 

     phelps laughs.  ethan doesn't.  the back of claire's head is 
     in his line of sight. 

                          phelps (cont'd) 
                boy, you really are grim. come here, 
                take a look. 

     he leads ethan to the window, which overlooks the city.
