     int. london safe house - night                            

     this barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of 
     buildings it's in.  ethan hurriedly digs through an overnight 
     bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered 
     bible he's used to contact max.  he flips through the pages 
     and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and 
     waiting on the tiny desk. 

     luther, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously 
     preoccupied.  krieger is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a 
     lager and watching cnn. 

     claire is at the window staring out, anxious. 

     krieger glances over the back of the sofa at ethan. 

                          krieger 
                you contacting your buyer? 
                     (no answer) 
                ethan? 

     from the desk, ethan glances up.  then goes back to the 
     computer.  krieger continues to glare over the sofa back. 

                          krieger (cont'd) 
                ethan?  oh, 'scuse me mr. hunt? 

     ethan ignores him, working.  his computer jams with static as 
     it connects to a bbs.  the screen blinks and displays the 
     familiar bible group service through which he's contacted 
     max.  when it asks him which chapter and verse for the 
     posting, ethan flicks through the bible, looking for the next 
     code.  he  begins to type. 

                max -- now might be an excellent time 
                to interpret scripture face to face. 
                meet on tgv, noon tomorrow.  take 
                seat 27.  bring our mutual friend 
                job.

     krieger suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible 
     out of ethan's hands to the floor. 

                          krieger 
                you're not going to any meeting without me. 

                          ethan 
                my contact is extremely shy. 

     he goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the 
     "enter" button. 

     luther and claire watch this growing conflict closely. ethan 
     sighs and stands up.  krieger pulls out the blue disk he took 
     from ethan in the computer room and waves it in front of him. 

                          krieger 
                i don't think you're in any position to 
                give orders, do you?  not while i'm 
                holding this. 

                          claire 
                krieger. 

                          krieger 
                stay out of this. 
                or 
                lachez - moi 
                or  
                t'agueue 

                          ethan 
                don't you mean this? 

     he reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical 
     disk.  he puts it back in his jacket pocket. 

     krieger stares for a second. 

                          krieger
                that's not it.  that's not the list. 

                          ethan 
                what's the matter, you don't know this 
                trick? 

     he holds the jacket pocket wide open, for krieger to look 
     into.  krieger does.  the pocket is empty. 

                          ethan (cont'd) 
                     (mock surprise) 
                where did it go?!  it's gone! 

     ethan walks over to claire, reaches into the pocket of the 
     trousers she's wearing and pulls out the disk. 

                          ethan (cont'd) 
                but not too far! 

     he palms the disk in his right hand. 

                          ethan (cont'd) 
                i know what you're thinking, krieger. 
                you're thinking, back in the computer 
                room -- i was up here -- he was down 
                there -- .  he was carrying two discs. 

     while he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from krieger. 
     when he rotates it back, the disk is gone again.  he holds up 
     his left hand.  it's there now. 

                          ethan (cont'd) 
                so hard to keep track of these things. 

     ethan shows his hands -- now both are empty. 

                          krieger 
                     (fuming) 
                where is it? 

     ethan pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. 

                          ethan 
                i thought you had it!  do you actually 
                think i'd let you have the noc list? 

     krieger just stares at him, shaken.  claire laughs.  krieger 
     looks at her.  he turns completely red.  when he looks back 
     at ethan, ethan holds two disks -- one in each hand. 

                          krieger 
                try any sleight-of-hand with my money and 
                i√≠ll cut your throat. 

     he tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms 
     out, slamming the door behind him.  ethan picks up the bible 
     and sees drake hotel. 

                          claire 
                i'm so sorry.  krieger was my call.  i've 
                never worked with him.  i'm sorry, ethan. 

                          ethan 
                we did what we had to do. 

                          claire 
                i'm going to try and get some sleep. 

     she leaves, closing the door behind her, leaving ethan and 
     luther alone. 

     angle                                                      

     ethan waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, 
     picks up the disk krieger threw out and brushes it off 
     carefully. 

     he replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his 
     jacket pocket. 

                          luther 
                krieger did have the noc list. 

                          ethan 
                now i want you to hold onto it. 

                          luther 
                what makes you trust me? 

                          ethan 
                because if you knew what you were getting 
                into, you never would have done it. 

                          luther 
                i'm not letting this list get out in the 
                open. 

                          ethan 
                exactly, that's your job.  tomorrow on 
                the train, you can't let this list get 
                out into the open.  what's the range of 
                this thing? 

                          luther 
                it's hard to tell.  i'm gonna have to be 
                close. 

                          ethan 
                i'll get you close. 

     claire opens the door. 

                          claire 
                ethan i need to talk to you. 

     ethan follows claire into her room where she shows him the 
     television screen.

                the unlikely setting...a farm in the 
                heartland of america...the state of 
                wisconsin, where federal agents claim to 
                have broken the brain trust behind an 
                international drug ring.  for a report we 
                go live now to cnn correspondent (joe 
                jones) in the state capitol, madison. 
                (joe)...? 

     cnn reporter speaks to camera, on the steps of a courthouse. 

                          reporter 
                authorities have identified the couple as 
                margaret ethan hunt and donald hunt.

     an older couple, mid-sixties, exit the doors and are led down 
     the steps of the courthouse in shackles.  the reporter and 
     other news crews race up to the door. 

                          reporter 
                here they are now. 

     camera follows the couple downstairs.  police roughly pull 
     them away from the news crews.

                they were apprehended this morning by the 
                dea in a major sting operation for the 
                illegal manufacture of the drug 
                methcathinone, known on the street as 
                "cat".

                          voice (o.s.) 
                similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen 
                by officials as one of the most powerful 
                and dangerous drugs in the world.  some 
                thirty-four cat labs have been seized so 
                far, but the recently widowed mrs. hunt 
                and her brother-in-law are believed to be 
                involved in a global drug distribution 
                network. 

     a public official exits the building.  the reporter and other 
     news crews charge up to him. 

                          reporter 
                mr. fairchild, agent fairchild, a comment 
                please. 

     the image on the television changes to an interview with a 
     public official who faces a bank of microphones. 

                          public official 
                i think it's sad, really.  farmers, 
                unless they're a conglomerate, are always 
                operating on a paper-thin margin.  i'm 
                afraid what we have here is a case of a 
                naive and lonely widow with a lot of 
                financial problems who chose to make 
                money through illegal means. 

                          reporter 
                that was john fairchild, the dea agent in 
                charge of this investigation.  officials 
                tell me that international law 
                enforcement agents are expected to arrive 
                here later today to question the hunts. 
                this is joe jones, cnn, love in madison, 
                wisconsin.

                          claire 
                bastard! 

     ethan switches tv off and paces away from it.  his anger 
     erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a 
     chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the 
     wall.  claire tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her 
     away. 

                          ethan 
                don't...don't touch me... 

     camera swing pans between them. 

                          claire 
                what are you going to do? 

                          ethan 
                     (turns to her and gestures at tv) 
                he's expecting my call. 
                     (strides to door) 
                i'm going to the station... 
                     (o/s at door) 
                and i'm going to call him.
