     krieger shakes with the strain of holding the rope.  his eyes 
     suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. 

     it's a rat.  krieger stares. the rat stares back.  neither 
     moves.  puzzled by krieger's lack of response, the rat crawls 
     forward, inquisitive. 

     krieger's eyes water, his nose twitches.  he's about to 
     sneeze.
