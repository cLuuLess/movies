     int. embassy work room - night

     golitsyn, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the
     elevator button but it wonít even light up.  he studies the
     elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ethan and
     sarah did moments before.

     he hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small
     door at the shaftís base.
