     int. rear car/engineer's section - day

     another conductor races into the power car, past his inert 
     companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the 
     train.  he grabs a radio and screams into it. 

                          conductor 
                no, no, it's in the tunnel! 

                          voice (o.s.) 
                stop the train! 

                          conductor 
                it'll crash into us!  accelerate, 
                accelerate.
