     ext. phone box - london - night                           

     close digital clock.  it reads 23.59.  angle widens to show 
     ethan looking at it with grim satisfaction.  he opens the 
     door of the phone booth and almost smacks right into -- 

     --the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just 
     inches in front of him.  startled, ethan looks up, but what 
     he sees shakes him to the core. 

     the man is jim phelps. 

     ethan shouts and almost falls back into the phone booth. 
     phelps leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly. 

                          phelps 
                you're a hard man to catch up with. 
                
     phelps falls towards ethan.  ethan tries to speak, but can't 
     even form words. 

     int - railway station cafe (day) 

     ethan and phelps opposite one another in a booth, phelps 
     looking clammy and listing to one side.  but the banter 
     seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close 
     colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, 
     finishing each other's sentences: 

                          phelps
                ..the next day i managed to drag myself 
                to the safe house, must've just missed 
                you..anyway, i checked our aliases.

                          ethan
                - and picked us up in the states -

                          phelps 
                - but you left before i could get there 
                and i could check just so many places.. 

                          ethan 
                yeah, smaller countries don't computerize 
                customs records - 

                          phelps 
                - so i watched europe. once you showed 
                up in england..it was easy. 

                          ethan 
                you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool 
                street. 

                          phelps 
                hey, i showed 'em to you! 

                          ethan 
                i remember.. 

     phelps smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an 
     upright position.  he opens a medicine bottle and takes the 
     pain killers. 

                          ethan 
                jim, who do you think you're kidding?  a 
                doctor's gotta look at that.  you can't 
                sit up straight. 

                          phelps 
                i can sit up straight.  i just can't..sit 
                up straight very well.  it's not 
                important!  i saw who shot me.  ethan, i 
                saw the mole.  it was kittridge. 
                     (a fist into the table) 
                kittridge! 

     phelps grips the sides of the table. 

                          ethan 
                kitteridge.  oh my god!  kittridge is the 
                mole? 

                          phelps 
                yeah. 

                          ethan 
                how did kittridge do it?..
