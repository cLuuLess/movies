     int. restaurant - night

     ethan's pov 

     ethan walks in the glass front doors, right next to an 
     enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. 
     he scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen patrons are 
     scattered around. 

     eugene kittridge is seated at a table in the middle. he and 
     ethan make eye contact.  ethan walks to the table, a couple 
     of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he 
     goes.  kittridge has been working on a pretty good-sized 
     lobster.  he rises to greet ethan and they sit. 
                          
                          kittridge 
                i can't tell you how sorry i am.  i know 
                how much jim in particular meant to you, 
                ethan.  personally as well as professionally. 

                          ethan 
                yeah. 

     he spots a stack of documents on the table.

     ethan picks them up.  there's a canadian picture bearing 
     ethan photo and the name phillipe doucette, credit cards, 
     driver's license, etc. 

                          kittridge
                passport, visas - you know the drill. 
                we'll work the exfiltration thru canada, 
                debrief you at langley.  throw the prague 
                police a bone, you know toss them a few 
                suspects.  follow me? 

                          ethan 
                yeah.  i follow you. 

                          kittridge 
                we've lost enough agents for one night. 

                          ethan 
                you mean i've lost enough agents for one 
                night. 

     kittridge seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, 
     carefully: 
        
                          kittridge 
                you seem hell bent on blaming yourself, 
                ethan. 

                          ethan 
                who else is left? 

                          kittridge 
                yes.  i see your point. 

                          ethan 
                why was there another team? 

                          kittridge 
                what? 

                          ethan 
                of imf agents.  at the embassy.  tonight. 

                          kittridge 
                i don't quite follow you. 

                          ethan
                let's see if you can follow me around 
                this room. 
                     (eyes moving around the room) 
                the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 
                and 8 o'clock...the couple waltzing 
                around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. 
                the waiter behind hannah at the top of 
                the staircase - bowtie, 12 o'clock. the 
                other imf team.  you're worried about me. 
                why?

                          kittridge 
                     (a tight little smile) 
                you're right.  maybe this'll save some 
                time. 

     the figures around the room have grown restless.  kittridge 
     tries to indicate that it's okay. he pulls some papers out 
     of his jacket. 

                          kittridge (cont'd) 
                for a little over two years now we've 
                been spotting serious blowback in imf 
                operations.  we have a penetration.  the 
                other day we decoded a message on the 
                internet from a czech we know as "max."

                          ethan 
                the arms dealer. 

                          kittridge 
                that's right.  max, it seems, has two 
                unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity
                and for corrupting susceptible agents. 
                this time he's gotten to someone on the 
                inside - he's put himself in a position 
                to buy our noc list. an operation he 
                referred to as "job 314".  the job he 
                thought golitsyn was doing tonight. 

                          ethan 
                but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy. 

                          kittridge 
                correct the actual list is safe at 
                langley.  "golitsyn" was a lightning rod, 
                one of ours. 

                          ethan 
                this whole operation was a molehunt. 

                          kittridge 
                yes, the mole's deep inside. and -- like 
                you said.  you survived. 

     ethan stares at him levelly. 

                          kittridge (cont'd)
                i want to show you something, ethan. 

     he now shoves the papers across the table.  they're xeroxed 
     copies of a wisconsin bank account in the name of donald and 
     margaret ethan hunt.  it shows a balance of $127, 000. 

                          kittridge (cont'd) 
                since your father's death, your family's 
                farm has been in sub-chapter s and now, 
                suddenly, they're flush with over a 
                hundred and twenty grand in the bank. 
                dad's illness was supposed to have wiped 
                out the bank account -- dying slowly in 
                america after all, can be a very 
                expensive proposition ethan.  so, why 
                don't we go quietly out of here onto the 
                plane... 

                          ethan 
                how about if we just go quietly into the 
                bathroom and i wash your mouth out with 
                soap - you pathetic button down 
                bureaucratic asshole. 

                          kittridge (cont'd) 
                ethan, i can understand you're very 
                upset. 

                          ethan 
                kitteridge, you've never seen me very 
                upset. 

        ethan takes something from his jacket pocket.  while 
        kittridge talks, ethan unwraps whatever is in his hand. 

                          kittridge 
                all right, enough is  enough hunt. you've 
                bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on 
                intimate loyalties to get away with it. 
                you're determined to shake hands with the 
                devil and i'm going to make sure you do 
                it in hell. 

     we see what ethan holds in his hand -- it's the piece of 
     bubble gum, half red, half green. he squeezes the gum, 
     mushing the two sides together. 

     ethan lashes out, swatting kittridge's glass of wine off the
     table in one quick motion.  as he does, he hurls the piece of 
     gum. 

     diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine 
     glass.  kittridge follows the trajectory of the glass -- 

     -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. his eyes 
     widen.  ka boom! 

     the tiny piece of plastique explodes, shattering the fish 
     tank.  a hundred gallons of water flow over the man and 
     woman, knocking them to the ground. 

     at the same time, ethan bolts for the door.
