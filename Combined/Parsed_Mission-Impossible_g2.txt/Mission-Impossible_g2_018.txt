     int. embassy party - night

     on a flight of stairs, hannah, dressed for the party and 
     slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. 

                          hannah 
                en route. 

     she also has a pair of visco glasses, which she trains on the 
     party below.  she pushes a micro switch on the side of her 
     glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the 
     lenses. 

                          phelps (o/s) 
                hannah, pull the shade (or - hannah go to
                night vision).

     the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands 
     out.  that head is golitsyn's, his hair a fluorescent green 
     where sarah sprayed it.
