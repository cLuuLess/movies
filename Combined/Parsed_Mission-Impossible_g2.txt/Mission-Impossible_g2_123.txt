     up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move 
     in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  when it appears ready 
     to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between 
     the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. 

     the screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the 
     floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip 
     with a gentle click, as to a magnet. 

     the screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  now the whole 
     shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. 

     it turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. 

     a rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop 
     near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  a 
     gentle whoosh is audible as frosty air blows through the 
     tube, cooling the room.
