     ext. embassy (as seen from charles bridge) - night

     outside the embassy, golitsyn escapes, pushing through the
     service area door and racing past a drunken couple who are in
     the midst of a lover√≠s quarrel, in russian.

     pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where phelps is
     still racing to meet ethan.  but he stops suddenly, as if
     hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening
     gloom.
