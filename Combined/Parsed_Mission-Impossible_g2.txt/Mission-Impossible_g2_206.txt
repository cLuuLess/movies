     ext. london pub - day

     luther sits on a high stool, his powerbook next to him, while 
     he sips a beer.  a television screen is featuring follow-up 
     coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in 
     the chunnel.  aside from emphasizing that it was the work of 
     a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in 
     the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was 
     there were no other fatalaties.  there are intermittent 
     sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of 
     arrivals and departures.  ethan into shot.  he sits beside 
     luther. 

                          luther 
                reach your folks? 
                     (ethan nods) 
                how they feeling? 

                          ethan
                about what? 

                          luther 
                the official apology from the justice 
                department, the vip treatment, you know, 
                the whole nine yards. 

                          ethan 
                well my mother was a little confused 
                about how the dea could mistake her and 
                uncle donald for a couple of dope smugglers 
                in the florida keys. 

     luther picks up his beer. 

                          luther
                     (laughs and with a british accent) 
                cheers. 

     they drink. 

                          ethan
                here's to  you, luther. (clink glasses)  to 
                being off the disavowed list. 

                          luther 
                hey, i'm the flavour of the month! 

                          ethan
                you're more than that, luther.  they were 
                mistaken about you and they're trying to 
                show you they know it.  they want you 
                back in. 

                          luther
                sure.  they want me back in so i won't 
                break in!  they still can't figure out 
                how we did it. 

                          ethan 
                you didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? 

                          luther 
                i figured i'd let 'em reinstate my back 
                pay, give me a promotion, check out my 
                office at langley and then, maybe, talk 
                about it. 

                          ethan 
                     (laughing) 
                it's all one big negotiation, isn't it? 

                          luther 
                why don't you come back with me? 

                          ethan 
                just don't know why i'd be doing it. 

                          luther 
                you really liked phelps, didn't you? 

                          ethan 
                he was a good guy for a long, long time. 
                just - not long enough. (looks up) gotta 
                catch my flight..(rising) 
                so.  how's it feel being a solid citizen 
                again? 

                          luther 
                oh man...i don't know.  i'm gonna miss 
                being disreputable. 

                          ethan 
                well, luther - if it makes you feel any 
                better i'll always think of you that way. 

     the two men understand one another and luther will say no 
     more.  the two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a 
     moment ethan disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative 
     luther looking after him.
