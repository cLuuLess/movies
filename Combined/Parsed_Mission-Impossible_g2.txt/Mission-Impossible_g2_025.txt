     int. embassy work room - night

     this work room is filled with combination lock filing 
     cabinets and various computer terminals.  ethan hands sarah 
     his visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them 
     upside down on top of a filing cabinet.  

     ethan straps on a visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, 
     switching several times. 

                          ethan 
                     (to sarah) 
                higher.  higher.  

                          sarah 
                higher. 

                          ethan 
                right, right.  good. 

     sarah adjusts the glasses. 

     through the glasses, 

     the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but 
     clear.  anyone sitting there will be recorded.
