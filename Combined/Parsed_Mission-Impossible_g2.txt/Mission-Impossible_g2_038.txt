     ethan and sarah exit an embassy service area by the 
     waterfront and blend into the embassy crowd, as an amorous 
     couple.

                in position.  jack open the door, let the
                package roll.

                          jack (o.s.)
                roger that.  opening doors now.

                stairway, youíre wrapped, go to
                transport.

     ethanís voice comes over hannahís earpiece.

                          hannah
                en route.

     hannah breaks off and goes up the stairs.
