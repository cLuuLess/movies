     int. communications room - day                           

     the technician who discovered the theft of the list sits at 
     one end of the now-empty conference table in the 
     communications room.  kittridge sits in a chair beside, 
     staring gravely at him. 

     he gets up and walks to the door, where harry barnes hovers. 
     kittridge lowers his voice, it's barely audible. 

                          kittridge (cont'd) 
                     (to barnes) 
                you and i know about this -- and that's 
                where it stops.  understand?  it never happened. 

                          barnes 
                what about him...? 

     he gestures to the technician, who watches them anxiously. 

                          kittridge 
                i want him manning a radar tower in 
                alaska by the end of the day.  just mail 
                him his clothes. 

     he leaves.  barnes turns to the technician, who looks up at 
     him anxiously.
