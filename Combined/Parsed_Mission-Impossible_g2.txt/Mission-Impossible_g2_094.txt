                          max
                i don't have to tell you what a comfort 
                anonymity can be in my profession -- like 
                a warm blanket. 
                     (abruptly) 
                my deal with job was subject to a 
                successful boot scan.  obviously it 
                didn't pass muster.  deal's off. 

                          ethan 
                what was your deal with job? 

                          max 
                six million dollars.  i'll give you the 
                same.  but i want the complete list now, 
                not just eastern europe.  i won't do this 
                piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  i want 
                the entire list, the true name of every 
                non-official cover agent throughout the 
                world. 

                          ethan 
                ten million.  ten million in negotiable 
                u.s. treasury certificates, in bearer 
                form, coupons attached.  and one more 
                thing -- your personal assurance that job 
                will be at the exchange. 

                          max 
                done.  bring it to me in london.  i want 
                it by the end of the week. 

                          ethan
                how will you make sure job will be there? 

                          max
                how will you make sure i'll have the list 
                in three days?  it's been a delight.  now 
                where can i drop you dear boy? 

                          ethan 
                i'm not being dropped anywhere without my 
                money. 

     max manages to laugh without coughing.  then, with an 
     admonishing forefinger: 

                          max 
                i'm going to have to front you 
                personally.  don't lose that money 
                without losing your life. 

                          ethan 
                i wouldn't dream of it. 

     max settles back and regards ethan.  a theatrical sigh.  she 
     fancies this guy. 

                                                            cut to:
