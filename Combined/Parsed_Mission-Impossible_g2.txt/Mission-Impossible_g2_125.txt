     int. cia - computer room - day

     it is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw 
     earlier.  no-one is there, there's not a sound but for the 
     gentle hum of the computer as it waits to be put to use. 

     now ethan's head descends slowly into the room, his hair 
     falling in front of him. 

     at first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, 
     but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then 
     shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his 
     ankles and understand.  

     he is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and 
     temperature read out on the computer.  suddenly ethan is 
     lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the 
     computer as the analyst enters the room.
