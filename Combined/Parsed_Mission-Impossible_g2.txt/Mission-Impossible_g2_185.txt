     int. car (next to maxís car) - moving - day

     kittridge and barnes looking - stop in doorway.

                          barnes
                nothing but civilians, gene.

                          kittridge
                this is bullshit - we donít even know
                what max looks like.

                          barnes
                maybe we donít have to know what he looks
                like.  if heís got that list, heís going
                to want to check it.  we should be
                looking for laptops.

                          kittridge
                good idea.
