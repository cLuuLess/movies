     int. cia langley lobby - day                               

     three firemen stomp into the main lobby of the cia 
     headquarters building.  ethan and krieger are among them, in 
     firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment.  

     ethan takes a breath as they cross to the guard's desk.  he 
     looks up, above him. 

     etched into the top of one wall are the words "and ye shall 
     know the truth and the truth shall make you free."

     they reach the guard.  ethan, who wears visco glasses, elbows 
     to the front of the group and takes charge. 

                          ethan 
                     (to the guard) 
                we picked up alarms in sectors three, 
                seven, and twelve. 

     the guard checks a screen in front of him. 

                          guard richard 
                yeah.  that's what i've got too. 

     the firemen look at each other.  who is this guy?  but he 
     seems to know what he's talking about, so -- 

                          ethan 
                     (to the guard) 
                what sector's the air conditioning? 

                          guard randall 
                uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in 
                sector twenty-one. 

                          ethan 
                i gotta go in there and shut it down! 

                          guard randall 
                nobody goes into any sector where the 
                alarm didn't go off. 

                          ethan
                do you want to blow the fire through the 
                whole building? 

                          guard richard 
                     (reciting policy) 
                nobody goes into any sector where the 
                alarm did not go off --
