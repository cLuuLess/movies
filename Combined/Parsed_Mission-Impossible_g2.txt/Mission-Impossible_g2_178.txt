     int. business car - moving - day

     the business car is similar to the one ethan saw on the first
     train they look across europe.  it√≠s crowded, maybe thirty
     men and women in suits, most of them already immersed in work
     on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones.

     one such woman is max in her seat, number 27.  matthias and
     the other man, last seen dropping off ethan in prague, sit
     across from her, her laptop is on the table next to her, in
     her briefcase.

                          max
                how long until we reach the chunnel?

                          matthias
                twenty minutes.
