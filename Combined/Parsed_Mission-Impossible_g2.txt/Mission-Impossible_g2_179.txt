     int. rear car - moving - day

     a man puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on
     the bunk-bed.  we only see his hands as he proceeds to take
     the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and
     assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous
     electrical parts inside.
