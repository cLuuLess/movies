     int. fire truck - day                                 

     in the fire truck, luther, who is watching on the visco 
     monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what 
     ethan sees. 

     he cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and 
     begins to whisper.  we hear only the moist, airy sound of his 
     breath, not the words. 

                          luther
