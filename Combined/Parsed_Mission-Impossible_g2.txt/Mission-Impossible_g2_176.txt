     ext. private helipad - day

     suddenly itís bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our
     eyes.

     kittridge and barnes step off a military helicopter, blinking
     at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.

     two agents immediately flank kittridge at the bottom and fall
     into step alongside, ready to brief him.  one of them holds
     out a small package with "for job" written on it.

     kittridge looks at him.  he rips it open.  a note inside
     simply says:

                      tgv.  london terminus
                              noon.

     kittridge looks at his watch.  itís ten to twelve.

     as he reads the note, something else falls out of the
     envelope and clunks to the ground.

     he bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.  cradled in his
     hand, we canít see what it is.  but to him, itís very
     interesting.

     he steps up his pace, headed for the car.

                          kittridge
                     (to the agent) 
                how long to the london terminus?

                          agent
                twenty, twenty-five minutes.

                          kittridge
                youíve got ten.  move!
