     ethan and krieger in the service area - preparing.  ethan 
     putting the mask in a bag. 

     the guard returns. 

                          guard 
                where's the other guy? 

     the guard moves towards ethan, who kicks back at him, pushing 
     him back to krieger, who zaps the guard on the back of the 
     neck.  he twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. 
     krieger quickly grabs him around the neck. 

     ethan turns.  holding the guard's head with one hand, krieger 
     pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with 
     the other.  he jabs it toward the base of the guard's skull - 

     -- but ethan is on him in a flash.  he grabs krieger's knife 
     arm shoving it up against the wall.  staring into krieger's 
     face in warning. 

                          ethan 
                zero body count. 

                          krieger 
                     (a threat) 
                we'll see.  

                          ethan
                time up. 

     ethan releases him and walks away.
