     int. train - claire√≠s compartment - night                              

     ethan and claire enter, ethan closing the compartment door. 
     he pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her. 
     she takes it, waits. 

                          ethan 
                it's cash. and a second passport. if 
                anything goes wrong when we're inside, if 
                you sense even the slightest deviation 
                don't look over your shoulder, you walk 
                away - you hear me? just walk away. 

                          claire 
                you don't think we're going to make it. 

                          ethan 
                i didn't say that. 

                          claire 
                you didn't have to......... 

                          ethan
                i just need you to be safe. 

                          claire
                what about you? 

                          ethan
                what about me - jim called an abort - i 
                didn't comply.  i lost the team. i just 
                need you to be safe. 

     claire's coolness causes ethan to hesitate just enough to 
     take it in. 

                          claire 
                i wish i'd never laid eyes on you.. 

     and they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing 
     and half-falling onto the converted bed.  she suddenly 
     resists.  he senses it and pulls away.  

                          ethan 
                sorry. 

     he rises and goes to the door.  he's got his hand on the knob 
     when claire wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him 
     to her and kisses him, deeply.  this time they sink slowly to 
     the bed. 

                                                            cut to:
