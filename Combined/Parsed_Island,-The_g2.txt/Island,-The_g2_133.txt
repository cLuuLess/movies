135   ext . encanto park - night

      lincoln and ester emerge through the gap onto a derelict tract.
      a once public park, now a construction site. mounds and craters
      of earth. dim shapes of huge vehicles, like sleeping dragons.
      patches of parkland, as yet untouched. bowed palms, dead grass,
      a stagnant lagoon, a dull mirror for the ascendant moon. on its
      shoreline is a dilapidated construct that was once a boathouse.
