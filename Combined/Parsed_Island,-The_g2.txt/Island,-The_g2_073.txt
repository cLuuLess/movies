75   int . foundation chamber

     a stopgun n o s e s through the door. followed by scheer moving in
     silence, honed. how much time has passed is unclear. he signals
     his censors to split off. tracking scheer's advance, we intercut:
     another foundation chamber: censors making their sweep. strobes
     of light from an armature mechanism moving up the row of tanks.
     it angles to project a grid across each nascent's face, then
     fires a short laser burst, searing a crosshatch into the brow.
     another foundation chamber: another contingent moves up another
     row of foundation tanks. the nascents within have cables plugged
     into their ears, filaments pulsing. the nascents a r e in a posture
     of rigor, sinews straining as they accept the data impression.

     returning to scheer as he reaches the end of the first chamber.
     no further access, just a continuing wrap of foundation tanks.
     he pauses, confused for a second. one of the censors comes up-

                                                                    55.



                                      censor
                      nothing , sir. no sign.

                                  scheer
                      they can't have got past this level.

     scheer peels off his headset, giving full leash to his senses,
     straining to concentrate. seconds of pent silence. then he hears
     a faint humming. his gaze slowly drifts up to a ventilator grid.
