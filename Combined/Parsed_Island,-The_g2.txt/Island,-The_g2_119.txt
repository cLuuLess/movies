121   ext . bus station - late afternoon

      a surging sound. a surface of water. a burst of spray. a dolphin
      leaps from the waves and hangs suspended. text scrolls around:
      "get out of state & out of mind - ride the grey dolphin line!"
      this is the next incarnation of the greyhound. the blue facade,
      crested into waves. we make out lincoln and ester, now looking
      more like transients than tourists, dirty, worn and exhausted.

                                                                      83.
