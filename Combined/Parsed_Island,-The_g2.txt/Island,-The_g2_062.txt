64   int . bedroom - lincoln's apartment - day

     lincoln stares at his own mirror image. his eyes, fraught with
     revelation. his clothes, begrimed with dirt and blood. he rests
     his head against the etherscreen panel, shuddering, pressing his
     eyes tightly closed. as if he could ever forget what he's seen.
