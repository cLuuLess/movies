133   ext. pedestrian alley - night

      lincoln pulls ester into the darkness - a narrow access, barely
      lit, hard to see - a sudden dead-end - they slam into a barrier--

      a chainlink f e n c e - the links shuddering - lincoln looks up and
      sees it's scalable - claws into the links - starts climbing-

      ester trying to climb - rattled by coughing - fighting to
      breathe - her limbs shaking - her muscles failing - then--

      - b o o m - a blinding electrical discharge - suddenly the fence is
      alive with electricity - burning fingers jitter across the links-

      lincoln at the top of the fence - jolted by the sudden shock -
      muscles in reflex - falling - landing the far side of the fence--

      ester still climbing - the jolt instantly toppling her back -
      landing the near side of the fence - more rattled than hurt --

      b u r d o n running towards them - thunderbolt smoking from the shot-
      lincoln on the far side of the fence - recovering from the fall--

      ester on the near side of the fence - cowering, coughing -

      b u r d o n jerks her up by the hair - like a rapacious viking - he
      looks through the fence at lincoln - sniffing her, almost bestial-

                               burdon
                     g o ahead. i'll look after her.

      lincoln ' s eyes flickering darkly - jaw clenching - the sense of
      danger urging him to run - but ester is in the giant's grips -

      ester clawing to break free - coughing, rasping - her fingers
      snag on the giant's arm-brace - tugging with all her strength--

      b u r d o n yowling at the sudden pain - lashing out - flinging ester
      into the fence - dropping the thunderbolt - clutching his arm--

      lincoln leaping onto the fence - scrambling up the link - the
      dark giant momentarily off-guard - he vaults over the top --

      - t h u d - burdon spins round - takes the full brunt of lincoln's
      impact - overbalancing - they crash to the ground -

      lincoln struggles upright - winded, but forced to face the dark
      giant - who is already on his feet, his mighty fist swinging out-

      - t h u d - lincoln takes a punch to the jaw - recoils, reciprocates
      throwing a left hook - hitting hard but the giant barely flinches-

                                                                      89.



      -thud-thud- burdon pounds into him - a storm of punches - his
      quarry, ducking and blocking - now backed up against the fence--
      ester retrieving the thunderbolt - trying to work the mechanism -
      coughing - hands shaking - accidentally touching the trigger -

      - b o o m - the shot blasts into the air - enough of a distraction
      for lincoln - he lands the giant with a bone-jarring left hook-
      b u r d o n keels over into the wall - cracking the back of his head -
      his knees buckling - sliding down - just catching sight of--

      lincoln and ester scrambling up over the fence - and then the
      quarry is lost from sight in a downpour of electrical sparks.
