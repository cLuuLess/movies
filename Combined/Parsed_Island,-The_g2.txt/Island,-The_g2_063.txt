65   int . centerville - day

     the routine flow of residents up the avenue. lincoln walks, head
     bowed, trying to look inconspicuous. showered, white shirt and
     blue slacks under his shearling, he looks a little too scrubbed,
     too clean. he spots a familiar figure up ahead. he catches up.

                                  lincoln
                    jonesy. . .

     j o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity-

                                                                           50.



                                 jones
                     hey, champ. are you alright? i heard
                     there was a contamination scare.

                              lincoln
                     i saw what happened to him.

                                 jones
                     what are you talking about?

                                       lincoln
                     starkweather . . . what they did to him.

     jones huffs, dismissively. lincoln grabs his shoulder, ardent-

                                 lincoln
                     they cut him open, jonesy. the y took
                     him upstairs and they cut him open.

     jones holds his gaze a moment, then shrugs off his grip.

                                jones
                     you caught that fucking p a t h o g e n ,
                     didn't you? you're contaminated.

                                    lincoln
                     j o n e s y , listen to me...
     but jones just backs away. lincoln makes to follow. then stops
     dead in his tracks. across the avenue, two censors are on patrol
     and his best friend is now heading towards them. with a barren,
     torn grimace, lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd.
