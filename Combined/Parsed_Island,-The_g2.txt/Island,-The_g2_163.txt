165   ext . platform mound - sunrise

      the fire is now reduced to a heap of embers. the tribespeople
      a r e asleep around the mound, wrapped in ethnic blankets. diggs
      and burdon move up stealthily, weapons at the ready. the horses
      bristle and snort, betraying their approach. the tribespeople,
      stirred by the noise, awake. diggs and burdon swing aim around
      the ring as faces rise and stare at them. none of the faces have
      white skin. diggs lowers his weapon and addresses the gathering-

                                diggs
                     i'm looking for two bond runners. they
                     ditched near here last night.

                                                                        106.



                                          diggs (cont'd)
                      one man, one woman. tattoos on the
                      forehead...
                              (nothing, just silent stares)
                      anyone's seen them, i got fifty green.
                              (still nothing, aggravated)
                      what the fuck are you? deaf and dumb?

      the tribal faces just keep staring. diggs scowls. then suddenly
      swings aim with the rainmaker and fires. -boom- hitting one of
      the horses in the haunch. it rears up, whinnying, setting off
      the rest of the horses. diggs turns back to the gathering-

                                     diggs
                     somebody start talking.

      he scans around the ring. then fixes on one of the women. she
      lifts a trembling finger to a man nearby. grey dove stiffens.
