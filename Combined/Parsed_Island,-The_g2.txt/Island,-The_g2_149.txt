151   ext. street tunnel - day

      the skiff plunges into the shadow of an underpass. the interface
      flashes: "uplink interrupt... autopilot disengaging". lincoln
      sits up, confused. the skiff is now slowing, drifting as if cut
      loose. he studies the controls again. positions one hand on the
      steering wheel, the other on the throttle. then he nudges it.

      the skiff lurches, veering out of its lane. another vehicle zips
      narrowly past, rocking them with its invisible backwash. ester
      looks at lincoln, suddenly alarmed. lincoln tries again, firm on
      the wheel, gentle on the throttle. and the skiff eases forward.
