141   ext . downtown street - morning

      a downtrodden neighborhood. the buildings look like remnants from
      our own era. a scruffy man slouches up to a gated storefront. he
      slots a key into a lock panel and the gate rolls up, squealing.
      we widen to a vehicle parked kerbside. a familiar grey cutter.
