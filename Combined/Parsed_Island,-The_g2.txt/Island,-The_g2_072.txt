74   int . foundation chambers

     amber light. the sound of slow bubbling. lincoln and ester pause
     to adjust to the gloom. they are in a hall of windows. ester is
     the first to venture forth, as if drawn, to the nearest window.

     behind the glass is a foundation tank. bubbling with viscous
     fluid, laced with various tubes pulsing matter to and fro. the
     tubes connect to a form. a human form, an adult form but curled
     foetally. i t is known as a "nascent". in this tank is a female
     nascent, shifting slightly, causing ester to gasp. the nascent
     registers the noise, turning its head. its eyelids are closed but
     its eyeballs move, questioning. a slight furrow appears on its
     crosshatched brow. ester recoils in sudden horror, perhaps
     remembering on some deep level that this is where she came from.

                                  lincoln
                    ester ! come on!

     spurred to action, ester follows lincoln onward up the hall.
     still conscious of movement all around, of nascents stirring at
     the sound of their footfalls like the ripples of a nightmare.
