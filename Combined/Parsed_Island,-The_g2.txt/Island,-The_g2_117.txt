      a flourish of music greets lincoln and ester as they enter. the
      fanfare conjures a holoform i n mid-air. a cartoon rattlesnake,
      benignly rendered, welcomes them with a clownish, fanged smile:

                                the snake
                      h i there! i'm tattletail! what e v e r you
                      want to know, wherever you want to go, i
                      got the answers! let's look at the menu!

      a set of text frames appear: "residential listings", "business
      listings", "transport listings", "hotel listings". lincoln
      assimilates. the terminologies are not unfamiliar.

                                 the snake (cont'd)
                      n o w let's make a selection!

                                                                     82.



                                   lincoln
                         ( b e a t , venturing)
                     transport...
                                  the snake
                     o k a y ! let me open that directory for
                     you! i'll be with you in two shakes!

      the snake rattles accordingly and coils in a holding pattern.
      then a tomographic map of the city appears. a red dot plants
      itself under a text flag "you are here!". then other red dots
      scatter across the map, each flagging with transportation icons.
