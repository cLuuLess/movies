88   ext . the red rocks - dawn

     a horizon. a brim of dawn over the red rocks. the view is framed
     by the mouth of a cave. lincoln sleeps within, slumped against
     the rock, his head bowed heavily. the touch of first light opens
     his eyes. his brow creasing, as if waking from a bad dream into
     a worse reality. he looks around only to find himself alone. he
     gets up, a little shaky at first, then ventures out of the cave.

                                                                     58.



     he emerges onto a ledge, perhaps fifty feet up. he pauses, eyes
     adjusting to the quality of light. he sees the storm has reduced
     to a low wind, combing the floorland o f scrub. now, across the
     ledge, he sees ester. perched on an outcrop, hugging her knees,
     watching the sunrise over the desert. he crosses and lowers to a
     crouch beside her. ester turns to him with a confused frown-

                                 ester
                    w h e r e did all the green go?
     lincoln looks deep into her troubled eyes. he answers gently-

                                 lincoln
                    the r e is no green. the windows in
                    there... they were just pictures.

     ester absorbs this with difficulty. lincoln rises again and
     stands looking out across the desert, into the barren unknown.
