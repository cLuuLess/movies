113   int . ticket window - day
      the sign on the window reads "tickets". lincoln assimilates. the
      word is familiar. he steps up to the counter with ester. a ticket
      clerk - female, immaculately groomed - greets them with a glossy
      smile. lincoln offers her the blue card. she seems not to notice.

                                    t h e ticket clerk
                     we l c o m e to phoenix union station. what
                     is your date of travel, sir?

      lincoln has to think. dates mean nothing to him. he ventures-

                                 lincoln
                     now...

                                t h e ticket clerk
                     an d what is your destination?

                                lincoln
                     o u t of state.

                                t h e ticket clerk
                     i'm sorry. could you repeat that?

                               lincoln
                     we want to go out of state.

                                t h e ticket clerk
                     i'm sorry. could you repeat that?

                                 v o i c e (o.s.)
                     l i k e talking to a wall, ain't it?

      lincoln and ester turn to look. the interceder is pale, bald,
      wearing leathers. a stranger to them, we recognize him as diggs-

                                       diggs
                     h o l o s e r v e . c h e a p e r than flesh and
                     blood but nothing between the ears.

                                                                     77.



      diggs demonstrates, wafting his hand across the ticket counter.
      it cuts through the ticket clerk with a holographic ripple.

                                   diggs
                      f i r s t time i used one of these, i
                      asked her out on a date...

      he grins genially, examining their faces, verifying his quarry.
      lincoln examines the pale man. the sense of danger is welling-

                                  lincoln
                      what do you want?

                                  diggs
                      j u s t wanted to help, that's all.
      d i g g s shrugs, disarming, trying to win them over, nice and easy
      per the mandate. then he notices the eyes of his male quarry. the
      pupils, black and dilating. suddenly the male jerks away, like a
      shying horse, drawing the female with him. diggs, unperturbed,
      makes no attempt to follow. turning his back on them, he touches
      a device concealed in his ear canal, a miniature two-way radio-

                                     d i g g s (into radio)
                      b u r d i e , it's them. east exit.
