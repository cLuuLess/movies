209   ext . processing plant - day

      lincoln moves quickly along the wall towards the back of the
      complex. hugging the shadows, scanning for onlookers. there is
      the processing plant and there, the ring of funnels. the sight
      brings a sudden rush of memories, painful memories, horrors.

                                                                        133.



      lincoln steels himself, then breaks from shadow and races for
      the nearest funnel. he makes a running lap. his fingers grab
      t h e lip of the funnel and he pulls himself up. reaching the lip,
      he finds the funnel mouth has been gridded o v e r . then he hears-

                                  a voice (o.s.)
                      s i r , this is a restricted area...

      lincoln lowers back to the ground. he finds himself facing a
      technician in a hardhat. his uniform reads "air processing".
