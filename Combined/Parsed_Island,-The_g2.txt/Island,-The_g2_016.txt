18   int . extractor shaft

     a deep steady thrum. giant extractor fans churn above and below,
     both directions seemingly limitless. the bleak concrete shaft is
     streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. on one
     such, we isolate lincoln and mccord. b o t h smoking cigarettes.

                                lincoln
                    i t ' s too bad.
                                mccord
                    what do you mean?

                                lincoln
                    t h a t your shift's almost over.

                                                                     16.



                           mccord
                you mean, these things? well, these
                things ain't good for you anyways.

                            lincoln
                the y taste good.

an exchanged smile. a pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure.

                         lincoln
                i like coming here. talking. most
                outsiders don't like to talk.

                              mccord
                that's because we ain't supposed to.
                they got rules about fraternization.

lincoln nods. another pause as they drag on their cigarettes.

                            lincoln
                what do you do when the shift's over?

                            mccord
                m o r e of the same. they cycle us onto
                the disposal detail. hump `n dump crew.

                            lincoln
                h u m p `n dump crew?

                              mccord
                d e b r i s clearance. we hump the heavy
                stuff to a site on the outside.
                          lincoln
                is it as bad as they say out there?

m c c o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. lincoln displays his gasmask.

                           lincoln
                the air... the containments.

                           mccord
                right.

                           lincoln
                but not everywhere. not on the island.

                              mccord
                    ( b e a t , stubs his cigarette)
                i don't know too much about that.
lincoln eyes him narrowly. mccord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter
into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile.

                                                                       17.



                                mccord
                    he y , take it from me, you got a sweet
                    deal right here. so why worry, huh?
     lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke.
     we tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans.
