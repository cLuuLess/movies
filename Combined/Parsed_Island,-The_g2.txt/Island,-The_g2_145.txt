147   int . underground parking lot - day

      the vehicle parked in bay 53 is a hybrid of sportscar a n d speed-
      b o a t , a two-seater known as a "skiff". lincoln and ester climb
      in. lincoln reviews the drive console, the controls, all of it,
      meaningless. his eyes cross an orb set in the steering wheel.

      the orb seems to blink and suddenly the drive console lights up.
      lincoln reviews it. a screen in front of him is flashing:
      "piloting: manual/auto?". he assimilates. then ventures-

                                                                     100.



                                lincoln
                      auto...

      the interface processes, then asks: "destination: name/address?"

                                 lincoln
                      o u t of state... west...

      the interface processes, then reports "undocking". lincoln and
      ester jolt as the skiff shunts forward. lode-poles pulsing ahead
      of them, the skiff moves out, as if pulled by a phantom tugboat.
