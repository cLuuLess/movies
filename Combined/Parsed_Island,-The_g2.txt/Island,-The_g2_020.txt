22   int. sales hall - day

     a hall of windows, each window framing a display case, each
     display case housing a different taxidermied a n i m a l . not unlike
     a museum. on closer inspection, more like a chamber of horrors.
     i n one window is a pig with a horribly distended abdomen. another,
     magnified, shows a mouse with a human ear grown on its back. in
     another, a chimpanzee stares out at us with glaringly human eyes.

                               dr. sanger
                   i t doesn't get any prettier, does it?
                   but this is not a freakshow, my friends.
                   this is a war museum. a history of our
                   battles with mortality... and defeats.
                   take the stem cell, for instance. a bid
                   to cultivate human parts for transplant -
                   in rodents, primates, barnyard animals.
                   it's enough to make your skin crawl. in
                   some cases literally, giving rise to a
                   new range of cross-species viruses. but
                   that's how we learn. from our mistakes.
     the y turn a corner. another hall of windows, portals onto tanks
     of amber fluid that might be formaldehyde. suspended within are
     embryos, fetuses and infants. all human. all grotesquely mutated.

                               dr. sanger
                   c a s e in point, the clone. back in the
                   beginning, the mapping of the human
                   genome was declared a historic landmark-
                   t o break the curse of heredity, to
                   correct congenital defect... genetic
                   engineering became the brave new world
                   of medical science. a bright future
                   that led to a dark age and much of the
                   legislation we know today. but while
                   the clone laws may have narrowed the
                   field, science marches on. only to hit
                   the same wall over and over again - the
                   enigma of growth, the alchemy that
                   takes us from embryo to adult. a clone
                   barely reaches infancy before its
                   growth enzymes misfire, resulting in
                   the kind of monstrosities - which are
                   only effigies - you see here.

     s o m e reassured sighs from the women. they turn another corner onto
     another hall. a hall of mirrors. simple, full-length mirrors.

                            dr. sanger
                   so what do we learn from our mistakes?
                   that human parts cannot grow outside a
                   human body. that human bodies cannot
                   grow outside nature's grand design.

                                                                  20.



a fat man, supporting his bulk with a walking stick, grunts -

                         t h e fat man
               s o what the hell are we doing here?

                            dr. sanger
               l e t ' s say one day you go to your doctor
               for a checkup. he discovers you have
               imminent renal failure and require a
               kidney transplant. what would you do?

                           t h e fat man
               i wouldn't do nothing. my brother'd
               g i v e me one of his. or else.

                           dr. sanger
               e v e n if your brother's kidney is with-
               o u t defect, there's still a 38% chance
               of rejection. or less if he's your twin.

                           t h e fat man
               he's not. he's older.

                          dr. sanger
               but what if you did have a twin?

o f f the fat man's confused look, sanger smiles and gently coaxes
him to face a mirror. their reflections stare back at them.

                           dr. sanger
               what if you had a genetic double who'd
               give you not just one of his kidneys,
               but both? in fact, any organ or body
               part you ever had cause to need?

                            t h e fat man
               what ? you mean like a clone? i thought
               you said all that stuff was a bust.

                        dr. sanger
               i said the problem with a clone is it
               doesn't survive infancy. the solution
               is to find a different starting point.
               why sow the seed when you can create
               the fruit? or what we like to call...
               an "agnate".

l y d i a starts clapping., then s t o p s , realizing this wasn't a cue.

                         dr. sanger
               an agnate is sequenced from a point on
               the cellular timeclock. i t is spawned
               post-maturate. it is `created' adult.

                                                              21.



                                dr. sanger (cont'd)
              o f course, its brain is still vestigial
              s o for the first three years we keep it
              i n suspension. during which time we use
              d a t a impression to supply a template
              f o r functionality - a process we call
              " f o u n d a t i o n " . after foundation we
              t r a n s f e r the agnate into "containment"
              w h e r e it enters the conditioning
              p r o c e s s . an ongoing series of quality
              c o n t r o l s designed to test and maintain
              i t s functionality. after a minimum of
              t w o years conditioning, the agnate
              b e c o m e s eligible for harvest...
                      ( t o the fat man, smiling)
              an d you, my friend, get your new kidney.

a hush falls among the group as they process what they've heard.
it's a sign of the times that none of them seems to be horrified.

                        t h e fat man
             l e t me see if i got this straight. you
             can create this whatever... this walking
             spare parts holder... but i gotta w a i t
             five years to get hold of em?

                        dr. sanger
             the spare parts, as you put it, need to
             be tested for integrity. but as many of
             our clients leave it till late in life
             to take out the policy, we do offer the
             option for early harvest. given the
             risks, however, a waiver is required.

                       t h e fat man
             s o five years or no warranty? for the
             premiums you're asking?

                        dr. sanger
             an d what if the organ you   needed was a
             heart? ask yourself, each     of you. if
             you had to put a price on     your life,
             your very survival - what     would it be?

a deep lull as the group considers this. sanger picks his moment.

                         dr. sanger
             i t ' s a question your insurance company
             has already answered. for them, the
             agnate obviates costly and ineffective
             treatment programs. should you decide
             t o take out our policy, not only will
             they lower your existing premiums but
             they'll also cover the production cost.

                                                               22.



the incentive ripples across the faces. a troubled one speaks up-

                          t o u r member
              this "agnate"... what happens to it?
              after our friend here gets his kidney.

                            dr. sanger
              that's entirely his decision. our role
              is intermediary. we, as the insurance
              provider, guarantee the condition and
              availability of the agnate but all
              other rights are retained. in legal
              terms, the policy holder is defined as
              a "sponsor". the premiums, in effect,
              becoming sponsorship payments,
              maintaining the agnate until such time
              as harvest is required. at such time
              and where feasible, the sponsor has
              the option to extend sponsorship,
              retaining the agnate for secondary
              harvest or, shall we say, let the
              policy expire.

                             t o u r member
              e x p i r e ? you mean... let it die?

                            dr. sanger
              n o . not as you and i know it, at least.
              the associations of life and death are
              no more applicable to an agnate than to
              a cow in a field. it exists in a state
              of limited consciousness - aware not of
              life but of functionality. imbued with
              the knowledge to maintain its function
              but without the capacity to question it.
              and yet, in many ways, the end if the
              most humane part of the process. the
              agnate goes to harvest without any fore-
              b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the
              sleep from whence it came. eternal or
              otherwise. there is mortality for an
              agnate. just utility and redundancy.

                        t o u r member
              s o it doesn't know? it doesn't know
              its... its p u r p o s e in life?

                         dr. sanger
              w h o does know my friend? who among us
              knows our true purpose in life?
s a n g e r ambles on, plunged in thought. lydia picks up the slack-

                                                                  23.



                          lydia
              this month we're offering a special
              rate for new sponsors. including a 10%
              discount on the his-and-hers plan.

she ushers the group round another corner. another holoframe and
another commercial, displaying the same characters as the first;
the old man with the walking frame is now running in a park--
the woman with the mastectomy is now at a party, her cocktail
dress broadcasting a full cleavage -- the young mother is now in
a waiting room, smiling as a doctor hands her a newborn baby.

                         lydia
              dr. sanger? would you like to close?

                            dr. sanger
              yes . . . now some of you may be thinking
              this commercial is staged. but these are
              not actors, these are past customers.
              real p e o p l e enjoying the real f r u i t s of
              sponsorship. what we offer here at the
              sanger institute is not just health
              insurance but indemnity. what we offer
              is the chance of a new lease on life...

the tour group applauds, this time without prompting from lydia.

                         dr. sanger
              n o w lydia will walk you through the
              rest of the tour and explain the
              various limitations and exclusions.
              but i do have time for a few questions.
h a n d s are raised. a waspish-looking woman butts ahead of them-

                         t h e wasp
              the commercial. the girl with the baby.
              what is that? a fix for infertility?

                         dr. sanger
              you mean the maternity plan? no.
              n o t endemic infertility at least. as i
              said, the law prohibits genetic
              alteration so a defect endemic in a
              sponsor will also be present in their
              agnate. no, what the maternity plan
              provides is a way round the risks and
              rigors of childbirth. under this plan,
              an agnate becomes eligible for
              pregnancy shortly after foundation. a
              simple donation of sperm from the
              father, then the agnate is fertilized
              and brings your baby to term.

                                                                      24.



                                the wasp
                     an d then what? you get it in the mail?

                                dr. sanger
                     f o r practical reasons, delivery is
                     handled by your healthcare p r o v i d e r .

                                t h e wasp
                     an d "the agnate" - what happens to it?
                     when it's, you know - delivered.

                                dr. sanger
                     the same rule applies. you can continue
                     your sponsorship. or not. and in this
                     case, there's a natural window for
                     compliance as the agnate is routinely
                     sedated after delivery. as to whether
                     it wakes up from that sleep, like i
                     said, the choice is yours...

                                      t h e wasp
                            ( b e a t , a shrug)
                     an y t h i n g to avoid stretch-marks, right?

     the other tour members, some more guiltily than others, laugh.
