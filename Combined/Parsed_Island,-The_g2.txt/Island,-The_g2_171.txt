173   int . studio - ranch home - late afternoon

      late golden sunlight through a mist of sawdust. abstract wood
      sculptures are visible. juniper wood, carved along the bias of
      the grain, polished to accentuate the curves of natural growth.
      an older woman runs a sander over a work in progress - 60's, in
      coveralls, gray her tied back, her face shielded by goggles and
      a bandana. she pauses to review her work, shutting down the
      sander, slipping off her goggles and bandana. her face is eerily
      familiar. her name is katherine. she now moves to the window,
      catching sight of something outside. curiously, she watches a
      vehicle coming down the long driveway. a dusty, grey cutter.
