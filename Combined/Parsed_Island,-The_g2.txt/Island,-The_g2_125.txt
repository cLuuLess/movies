      a blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. more like
      a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. "liners" slot
      in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries.

                                                                    85.



      lincoln and ester sit waiting. lincoln, rigid, watchful. ester,
      gazing across at the mexican woman, who as the infant cradled
      asleep. ester glances wistfully at lincoln. then she frowns-

                                      ester
                      lincoln , what is that? on your face?

      lincoln turns, touching his face. he feels stubble there. for
      the first time. his body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural
      to him. ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek.
      lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. but
      her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. their eyes
      slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. then
      ester's face contorts slightly. she emits a shallow cough.

                                 lincoln
                      a r e you alright?

      ester clears her throat. but another cough follows.

                                ester
                      m y throat... it feels dry...

                                     lincoln
                      o k a y . . . i'll get you some water.
