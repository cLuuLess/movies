171   ext . the north face - morning

      diggs and burdon reach the foot of the rocks. neither speaks,
      communicating in hand-signals. diggs slips into the lode-canal.
      burdon covers, sweeping the thunderbolt across the south face.

      diggs emerges from the far side of the lode-canal. he stays low,
      moving up into the rocks. then, from above, a rock dislodges,
      rattling down. diggs reacts instantly, targeting, opening fire-

      - b o o m - b o o m - the shots from the rainmaker swathe across the rock.
      the thunderbolt now adding to the barrage, burdon firing from
      the far side - shots, bolts, kicking up a storm of dust --
      suddenly holding fire, waiting for the dust to clear, reloading.
      no sign of movement. just a slide of rubble. fading echoes.

      d i g g s steals onwards up the rocks - into the fog of dust - the
      sunlight and shadow playing tricks on his eyes - then suddenly-
      lincoln bursts out of the dust - from the left - tackling the
      pale man - both of them toppling - tumbling down the slope --

      thudding to a halt at the lip of the lode-canal - the rainmaker
      lost in the fall - the impact throwing up a billow of dust --
      the dustcloud - diggs and lincoln struggling, clawing, punching -
      lincoln, with surprise on his side, gaining with the upper hand--

                                                               108.



diggs' clawing fingers discover lincoln's knife - tugging it from
his jacket - lincoln grabbing his wrist, fighting for control -
the knife moving between them - diggs with better leverage - the
blade inching towards lincoln's face - pressing into his cheek--

lincoln's eyes - welling black, almost inhuman - the sense of
danger screaming in his ears - he grabs the pale man's throat -
diggs' eyes - bulging as he strains to push the knife home -
oxygen draining - conscious ebbing - he slumps back -

lincoln regains the knife - the pale man seems to be out cold -
but he's not sure - he pauses holding the blade over him, then--
- b o o m - the knife flies from his grip in a burst of discharge -

burdon snaps aim for another shot - beading - his target moving
now - dropping out of the firing line - into the lode-canal--

burdon inches toward the edge - thunderbolt angling downward -
into the trench - then suddenly he's grabbed by the ankles -

lincoln straining to overbalance the giant - feet up against the
wall - like trying to topple a tree - finally winning some give-

burdon topples into the trench - his ankles clamped by his
quarry - both men meeting the concrete with a bone-shaking-

- thud - lincoln is crushed beneath the massive weight - the giant
already recovering from the fall - now dragging him upright--

- thud - burdon throws a punch - mightily - hurling his quarry
across the trench - moving in quickly, following up with a kick--

- thud - lincoln crumples as the boot smacks into him - then
another kick - then another - the world starts blurring --

burdon turns away - his quarry disabled for now - he recovers
his thunderbolt - turns back to administer the coup de grace--

lincoln looks up - the giant looming - the muzzle of his weapon
thrumming with energy - the rivets on his denims start rattling--

burdon spins round - the thunderbolt suddenly ripped from his
grasp - there, in the distance - an eastbound barge is coming -

lincoln scrambles up the wall of the trench - muscles straining,
feet slipping on the concrete - escaping the imminent vessel --

                                                               109.



diggs coming to - now seeing his quarry a short distance away -
emerging from the lode-canal - he looks around for a weapon, then-

                             burdon (o.s.)
               diggs! get me outta here!

burdon struggling to climb out of the trench - with one arm,
it's almost impossible - fighting against his own weight--
diggs reaching the edge - seeing the eastbound barge coming -
grabbing his partner's outreached hand - pulling him upward -

burdon's panic - his other arm flinging away - his metal brace
snared by the lode-stream - the force shuddering his entire body-
diggs pulling with all his might - feet slipping - locked in a
tug of war with the lodestream - the barge is closing fast--

burdon's horror - now suspended between the two forces - feet
kicking - the barge is almost upon him - he screams agonized--

                           burdon
               help me! help meeeee!

the scream is instantly lost in the whoosh of the barge. diggs,
stunned, just looks at his hands, empty, spattered with blood.

                        diggs
               burdie...?

the shadow of the rock - lincoln rejoins ester - casting a look
back - the eastbound barge now plummeting into the distance--
d i g g s stooping at the edge of the trench - looking down - all
that remains of his partner is a smear of blood at the concrete--

lincoln and ester reaching the foot of the rocks - seeing the
westbound barge against the sunrise - snaking into the passage--
diggs pulling upright - spotting his quarry - fire in his eyes -
drawing out a boot-knife - slipping it between his teeth--

the westbound barge pulling through the canyon - lode-poles
pulsing ahead of it - polarity thrumming in opposing flow--
lincoln and ester start running as the barge comes towards them -
lincoln pulling ester along - struggling to match the pace--

a sound like a beating tympany coming towards them - they look
round to see - a shadow running along the top of the barge--
d i g g s flinging himself off the barge - the blade in his teeth -
arms spread - for an instant, like a vulture against the sun--

                                                                110.



lincoln is suddenly crushed by the weight of his landing - ester
is hurled sideways - into a ditch - lost in a cloud of dust--
d i g g s pulling himself up, astride of lincoln - snatching the
knife from his clenched teeth - the sound, like a whetstone--

lincoln spitting dirt - suddenly grabbed by the scalp and tugged
sideways - twisted partways o n t o his back, forced to look up at--
a black spot against the sun - diggs' face set in a murderous
sneer - he wants to see this fucker's e y e s - the torment--

lincoln dazzled by the sunlight - but suddenly knowing the face
of death - now catching the brief glint of the knife as --
d i g g s plunges the blade down - slicing into his quarry's hand as
he throws it up in defense - his quarry yowling with pain--

lincoln feeling the stab - his deepest instinct suddenly awoken -
every impulse, every fiber brought into alignment - survival--
d i g g s is hurled into the air as lincoln surges upward - he
tumbles backward into the dust - losing hold of the boot-knife--

lincoln pushes himself upright - only makes it half-way -
scrambling towards the pale man - all fours, like an animal--
d i g g s clawing around in the dust - fingers finding metal - the
boot-knife - he brings it up - slashing at his imminent quarry--

lincoln recoiling - the blade nicking his face - sudden rage -
grabbing the pale man by the arm - swinging him round into--
- b o o m - the moving wall of freight containers - as the westbound
barge passes - diggs bounces off - stumbling to keep balance--

lincoln on the retreat - the pale man coming at him with the
knife - another nick - seeing a gap now, shoving him backwards--
- b o o m - the moving wall resounds - diggs howls - snagged by a
bolt - hurt, his fury becomes incandescent - he strikes madly--

lincoln stumbling back - the pale man coming at him - the blade
flashing to and fro - frenzied - like a threshing machine--
f o r c i n g him up against the rocks - the knife almost upon him -
he grits his teeth and lunges forward - charging like a bull --

diggs careens backward, still swiping the blade - digging into
his quarry - headlong towards the moving wall - hitting with--
- w h u m p - no resonant boom - no bouncing back - diggs has hit a
gap between the containers and his head has been lopped off -

                                                                       111.



      lincoln stands horrified - as the headless body is spun by the
      moving wall - dropping into the trench as the barge tails off-
      the westbound barge gains speed, leaving the canyon. but there
      is ester, running after it, vainly, coughing and sputtering.

                                   lincoln
                     ester! stop! it's no use!

                               ester
                     we have to... get to... the island...

                                 lincoln
                     it's going too fast!

                               ester
                     we have to... get to...

      ester staggers a few more steps, then collapses to her knees,
      rasping for breath. as lincoln reaches her, she slumps back into
      his arms. her head lolling, eyes rolled back to white, a drool
      of blood spilling from her lips. then the blast of a claxon c u t s
      the air as the westbound barge disappears into the distance.

                                                          f a d e to black.
