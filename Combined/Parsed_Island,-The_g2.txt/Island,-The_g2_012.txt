14   int. subway platform - sector four - day

     not so crowded at this hour. halfway down the platform we see a
     vending machine with confections in nameless silver wrappers. a
     mouse-ish resident collects a bar from the trough. his name is
     kleinwort nine-alpha. seeing lincoln approach, he preempts-

                              kleinwort
                   no, no, no. use your own sugar quota.

                                 lincoln
                   c'mon, kleinwort...

     he says this amicably enough but he's using his imposing presence
     on the smaller man. kleinwort sighs and breaks off a chunk.
                             lincoln
                   so what's up with the censors, huh?

                                  kleinwort
                   they're conducting a census check. or
                   don't you watch the bulletins?

                            lincoln
                   i know what it is. i've just never
                   seen them out in this sector before.

                                     kleinwort
                   probably just tracking a glitch. a bad
                   scanner or maybe an userware defect.
                          (off lincoln's puzzled look)
                   ethercuffs. they get damaged, you get
                   a false read. sometimes even a dropout.

                               lincoln
                   what are you saying? they lost someone?

                                  kleinwort
                   someone just isn't showing up where
                   they should be. what do you care?

     a rush of air heralds the shuttle, curtailing the conversation.
     beneath his tousling hair, a frown plays on lincoln's brow.
