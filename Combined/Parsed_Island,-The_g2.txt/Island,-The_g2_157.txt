      silence prevails but for the faint rattle of ester's breathing.
      lincoln sits on low stool, in sentinel over her as she sleeps.
      in his eyes, we see the weight of foreboding. he doesn't know
      what they'll do when she wakes. of a moaning sound he looks at
      ester. then realizes it isn't coming from her. the sound is far
      off, a rhythmic moaning. now discernible as the chant of voices.
