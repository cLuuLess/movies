145   int . apartment - day

      lincoln enters, wary, scanning around. a living room. framed
      pictures. a sofa, chairs. a coffee table, empty bottles,
      cigarette packs, a full ashtray. a bureau, some paperwork.
      silence, stillness. no sign of life, no sense of danger. lincoln
      moves across to the bureau and starts leafing through the
      papers. ester ventures in through the door, curious-

                                 ester
                     what are you looking for?

                              lincoln
                     i don't know. something. just wait
                     there and make sure nobody's coming.

                                                                    95.



as he leafs the papers, ester waits dutifully by the door. her
eyes wander across the framed pictures. then narrow onto a 3d
p h o t o g r a p h . a college boxing team photo, grinning cup winners.

                            ester
                l o o k at this...

lincoln returns to her. ester points to the photo. a face in the
row, blurred but eerily familiar. lincoln seems not to react.
ester, curiosity piqued, scans the other pictures. she alights
on a framed certificate - "thomas r. lincoln, attorney-at-law".

                            a man's voice (o.s.)
                what the hell are you doing?

lincoln turns to confront a man in a robe. disheveled from sleep,
grey from a hangover... the man's face is unmistakably his own.
this is tom lincoln, sponsor of lincoln six-echo, his bleary
eyes now widening in disbelief as he recognizes his agnate-

                           tom
                oh, jesus...

lincoln is better prepared for this encounter but still stunned
by the sight of his double in the flesh. sponsor and agnate stand
frozen. the only movement is ester, her eyes flicking between
the same men, fraught, confused. lincoln breaks the silence-

                           lincoln
                who are you?

lincoln steps closer, eyes piercing. tom takes a step back.

                            tom
                the y said... i'd never have to see you.

                           lincoln
                who?
lincoln takes another step closer. tom takes another step back.

                           tom
                the people...

                            lincoln
                what people?

lincoln takes another step closer. tom stiffens, gathers himself-

                             tom
                look, if you don't get out of here
                right now, i'm calling security...

                                                                  96.



lincoln examines him, assimilating. his double seems to be as
belligerent as he is. reasoning now, threat response kicking in.
lincoln draws the hunting knife. unused to it, he points it like
a gun. but it's enough of a threat for tom, who swallows dryly-

                           tom
                why are you here? what do you want?

                         lincoln
                i want to know...

tom grimaces at the ambiguity. that face. his f a c e . if not for
the pounding headache this would be a bad dream. he lowers onto
the sofa. finds a cigarette and lights up. a drag, mind kicking
in. the knife cautioning him. with a slow exhale, he confesses-

                             tom
                one of the partners at my firm... he
                told me about it. gave me a referral.
                i thought he was joking at first. i
                went out there, took the sales tour.
                even before that i knew it wasn't a
                joke. there was this discretion agree-
                ment. i never saw anything like it and
                i've seen a lot. ironclad... breathe a
                word and they've got you by the balls.
                i don't know... there's cancer in my
                family. maybe it was just to keep up.
                all the partners were on the policy.

                           lincoln
                the policy?

he looks at his agnate. then realizes the level of ignorance.

                               tom
                christ, you have no idea, do you?

                             lincoln
                about what?

tom drags his cigarette, fingers trembling. he shakes his head-

                         tom
                i can't fucking do this...

                            lincoln
                what are you talking about?

lincoln moves closer, pointing the knife. tom flinches, then-

                                  tom
                insurance. you're an insurance policy.

                                                                   97.



                           lincoln
               what is that?

                             tom
               health insurance... medical...

                           lincoln
               what does that mean?

                         tom
               if i get sick... if part of me gets
               sick... i take a healthy part from you.

                             lincoln
               why?

                          tom
               how do you expect me to answer that?
               it's just how it works, that's all.

tom looks at his agnate. the insistent stare. the knife, pointing
at him like a finger. his fear yields to a flicker of anger-

                           tom
               what do you want? a fucking apology?

                          lincoln
               why do i look like you?

                              tom
               because you are me . . .

                        lincoln
               i don't understand.

                              tom
               because they made you from my cells...

                             lincoln
               made me?

                             tom
                      ( a flare of anger)
               that's right. you were made. cooked up
               in a centrifuge like a fucking boiled
               egg. every thought running through your
               head, every word coming out of your
               mouth, all of it, manufactured, made...

lincoln frowns, trying to assimilate. too much to process.

                             lincoln
               you . . . you're the one who made me?

                                                                98.



                         tom
               no.

                          lincoln
               who made me?

                        tom
               i signed a contract. i can show you.

he gestures to a mirror on the wall. lincoln steps back but his
eyes are unremitting. tom rises, cautious, crossing to the wall.
he opens the mirror to reveal a wall safe. his trembling fingers
tap the keypad and the safe hisses open. he draws out a contract
folder embossed with a crosshatch. then offers it to his agnate-

                           tom
               it's all right there. who, why...

lincoln takes the contract folder and starts flipping the pages,
reading. a pendulous silence falls. tom stands watching, smoking
nervously. ester stands by the door, trying to take all this in.

                           tom
               look you've got what you wanted. now
               why don't you just get out of here?

                                lincoln
                      (pause, looks at him)
               there are men out there, looking for
               us. i want you to make them stop.

                        tom
               i can't...

lincoln sets down the contract and brings up the knife again.

                          tom
               i can't. look, i'm a lawyer, i know how
               it works. the contract, everything, it's
               all laced with confidentiality clauses.
               it means they don't want this to get
               out. it means whatever i do, they're
               not going to stop. you understand?

lincoln pauses, assimilating. his double's expression indicates
that he's telling the truth. maybe try a more practical request-

                         lincoln
               do you have transport?

                                 tom
               transport , yes... yes, parked
               downstairs... bay 53... take it...

                                                                      99.



                                lincoln
                     and then you'll call security?

      lincoln steps closer, pointing the knife. tom tries to stay dead-
      pan. the lawyer kicking in. look them in the eye when you lie-

                                tom
                     i'm not going to call security. i'm
                     not going to call anybody, okay?

      lincoln looks at his double, reason now yielding to anger. deep,
      roiling. tom looks at his agnate, fear welling, deadpan cracking-

                                  tom
                     look, maybe there's something... maybe
                     there's a way to cancel the contract...

      lincoln presses the tip of the blade to his double's cheek.

                                tom
                     for christ's sake! it's not my fault!

      lincoln inches the blade deeper into the trembling face, drawing
      blood. the anger urging, hungry for more blood. then suddenly-

                                     ester
                     lincoln ! no!

      lincoln looks at her, the anger interrupted, the knife still in
      place. he pauses. then returns to his double. the dreading eyes,
      the trickle of blood down the face. his e y e s . his f a c e . a long,
      foreboding moment. then suddenly lincoln lashes out. his fist
      sends his double flying, falling in a flurry of contract pages.
      lincoln stands over him, looking down, like a dominant species.
      his double is unmoving, unconscious. lincoln abruptly spins away.
