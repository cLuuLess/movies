143   ext . apartment building - morning

      an apartment building towers overhead, vaguely ominous. lincoln
      approaches the entrance with ester. we now see he has a band-aid
      covering his crosshatch. he takes ester briefly aside, teasing
      some tresses over hers. as she gently smooths down her hair,
      ester catches his eye. a look flickers between them. then-

                                  d o o r m a n (o.s.)
                     fancy dress, was it, sir?

      a doorman is looking at them like they just rolled out of a club
      he wouldn't be seen dead in. off their flustered looks, he gives
      an apologetic smile. then opens the door and holds it for them.
      lincoln reaches for ester's hand. then stiffly leads her inside.
