140   int . cin booth - night

      the flourish of music greets lincoln as he enters. the cartoon
      rattlesnake appears and smiles his clownish, fanged smile:

                               the snake
                     hi there! i'm tattletail! what e v e r you

                     got the answers! let's look at the menu!

      the set of text frames appears: "residential listings", "business
      listings", "transport listings", "hotel listings".

                                the snake
                     n o w let's make a selection!

      a heavy pause. lincoln's voice comes with a slight tremor.

                              lincoln
                     residential...

      the snake rattles and coils. then a headshot a p p e a r s with the
      face of jamil starkweather , scaled across with a red line.

                                       the snake
                     starkweather , jamil... i'm sorry! this
                     listing is blocked from the directory!

      lincoln stands, darkly intent on the face. now irrefutably the
      same face he saw in his life below. the snake shakes its rattle-

                                                                           93.



                                the snake
                     you want me to find another listing?
      lincoln looks at the snake, flicking its tongue, coiling.

                                                             f a d e to black.
