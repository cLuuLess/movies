44   int. residential block - sector four

     a vertical onto a residential block: the grid of crosswalks, the
     tiers of frosted facades; quiet, the residents still dormant--

     a drum of footfalls: then a figure breaking frame, racing up the
     walkway of an upper floor; then another figure, in hot pursuit --

     t h e lockdown i n i t i a t e s : the lights shifting spectrum from white
     to ultraviolet, bathing the quadrant in a lambent purple haze--

     s t a r k w e a t h e r : his eyes bulging with panic as he races up the
     walkway, straining for an ethergate a t the far end of the floor--

     lincoln : his eyes charged with adrenaline, straining to close
     ground on his assailant; oblivious to the building noise of--

     t h e lockdown: locks hissing, lights flashing, ripping up the row
     of frosted facades; sweeping past lincoln and onward toward--

     s t a r k w e a t h e r : the ripple of hissing locks rushing up on him, he
     pours on the pace, sneering with effort as he tries to outrace--

     t h e lockdown: the ripple spearing ahead of him to the end of the
     floor; now banking across the ethergate a n d sealing the exit.

     s t a r k w e a t h e r : stalled by the realization he's trapped; he spins
     round, looking for another avenue of escape only to find--

     lincoln: blindsiding h i s assailant with a headlong tackle; both
     men toppling over, hitting the floor with a bone-jarring thud--

     s t a r k w e a t h e r : quick to recover, breaking lose of entanglement;
     now struggling to his feet, stumbling onward up the walkway--

     lincoln : gets up to resume pursuit, then pauses, spotting his
     ethercuff, discarded on the ground. he looks up in confusion at--

     s t a r k w e a t h e r : a short distance ahead, climbing over the walkway
     rail; launching himself off, into a seemingly suicidal plummet--

     lincoln : leaning over the rail, seeing his assailant land safely
     on a crosswalk beneath, resuming his flight on the lower floor as-

     - b o o m - a gunblast r i p s the air. a keening sound builds to a wail-
     - t h u d - lincoln jolts as something hits his shoulder, catching him
     off-balance, a stab of pain keeling him onto the rail -clang -

     lincoln slumps into fg - two censors converging like white ghosts
     from the purple haze - one reprimanding his recalcitrant cohort-

                                                                           39.

                    you asshole! you hooked the wrong one!
     he crouches to examine lincoln. blood is blossoming from a wound
     on his shoulder, jutting from which is a projectile. the censor
     presses its base and it snaps loose of its unintended target.

     n o w we see the projectile more clearly. a fat metal pellet, snub-
     n o s e d , finned at the tail by four metal teeth. on impact, the
     nose recesses to release a springload a n d the teeth snap forward
     to bite into the target. this device is known as a "hookhead".

                    t h i n k you can walk, buddy?

     lincoln nods slightly. the censor unloops a tri-key f r o m his neck-

                               censor
                    you see this? it'll get you past the
                    lockdown. you're to report to the
                    medical center. you understand?

     o f f lincoln's blank stare, the censor presses the tri-key i n t o
     his palm. then departs. lincoln stays where he sits, still dazed
     from the concussion. absently he watches the censors race off up
     the walkway, dissolving back into the purple haze as we-
