179   int. motel room - evening

      s c h e e r opens the door. merrick stands at the threshold with an
      attache case. scheer, seemingly unsurprised, brings him inside.

                              scheer
                     i told you we shouldn't have gone to
                     outside personnel. they were cowboys.

                               merrick
                     we had no choice, karl. we had to keep
                     this away from the institute.

                                  scheer
                     an d now?

      merrick lowers in a chair, grim and leaden. he opens his attache
      and pulls out a contract folder. he hands it to scheer.

                                   scheer
                     what's this?

                                 merrick
                     your resignation papers. maybe `early
                     retirement' would be more accurate...

      s c h e e r leans forward, frowning, curious.

                                merrick
                     t e n platinum bounty - if you sign the
                     papers, their loss becomes your gain.

                              scheer
                     a parachute... so there's a jump?

                                merrick
                     you understand that whatever happens,
                     the institute must be able to deny it.

      s c h e e r says nothing. merrick reaches in the attache and pulls out
      a case. inside are a row of ampules and a pressure syringe-gun.

                               merrick
                     we use a chemical to dispose of waste
                     product. it's called di-halcyonate. i t
                     reacts on a molecular level to start a
                     process of internal combustion. the
                     subject is incinerated from the inside
                     out. in post-mortem application it's
                     done its job before rigor mortis. in a
                     live subject, well... you can imagine.

                                                                     118.



                                scheer
                     you want to dispose of your products.

                                 merrick
                     i t ' s a little more complicated than
                     that. we have to be very... thorough.
                     if you still have it in you, that is.

      s c h e e r gives him a sideways look. then displays the usmc ring.

                                scheer
                     why do you think i still wear this?

                              merrick
                     i don't know.

                               scheer
                     i was discharged from the marines for
                     insubordination. if you asked anyone
                     i n my unit, they'd call it heroism. i
                     disobeyed an order to fall back. i took
                     out a bunker complex single-handed.

                               merrick
                     s o you wear it is a badge of honor?

                                scheer
                     n o . it wasn't bravery. i wasn't afraid
                     of dying. i just didn't care. you see,
                     i suddenly realized i was just a sack
                     of flesh with a heartbeat. life, death,
                     i just couldn't see the point anymore.

      merrick allows a respectful pause, then-

                                   merrick
                     you'll find a vehicle parked outside.
                     it's unregistered, difficult to trace.
                     i take it we have an agreement...?
