158   int . pithouse - sunset

      the mud walls show a skeleton of saguaro ribs, cholla branches.
      it's cosy in here, dim. the living area, recreated with mats and
      pottery. lincoln finds ester looking around, between excitement
      and confusion. she turns to him, her voice wavering, wheezing-

                               ester
                     is this... is this place the island?
      lincoln answers with a softly negating look. ester's face slowly
      falls, the energy draining from her eyes. she lowers onto one of
      the mats and lies down, huddling. she looks up to him, wheezing-

                                ester
                     i'm tired. let me rest for a while.
