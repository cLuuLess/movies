99    ext . sky over the desert - night

      f r o m darkness grows a seed of light. the whisper flies low and
      quiet, its spotlight roving the undulant desert. now picking out
      metal glints as it banks over a scrapyard. now training its beam
      on a figure in the dust whirl beneath. ozzie, his hair flying
      wild, gesticulating madly. the whisper follows his directions,
      nosing onwards, its spotlight corrugating across the red rocks.
