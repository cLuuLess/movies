118   ext . street - day

      lincoln and ester walk up the street. wary of attention, they go
      with the flow of figures, eyes peeled for predators. the sights
      of the city now seem hostile. faces flash past, dead-eyed in sun-
      g l a s s e s . traffic rushes like steel rapids. storefronts construct
      a black wall. holoframe b i l l b o a r d s loom, mocking, half-noticed:

      - - a woman in a bathroom, adjusting her sexy neglige; a crack in
      the door shows a man in bed, waiting; the woman closes the door
      and picks up what looks like a toothpaste tube; she arches her
      eyebrow; "f.i.g. f e m i n i n e impulse gel... because who needs him?"
      - - a cemetery under a grim overcast sky; suddenly a frisbee flies
      across frame; an old woman, dressed like a teenager, catches it;
      she tosses it to an old man dressed likewise; a text super "death
      sucks!", a sting, "new gaza healthcare: your life is our life."
      lincoln and ester stop at the corner. they look around, blindly,
      no coordinates, no frame of reference. urban canyons, identical,
      gordian a n d chasmic. p a s s i n g figures jostle. then lincoln spots
      something across the street. it looks like an over-sized phone
      booth. its beacon flashes; "c.i.n. - city information network."
