219   int . containment

      i n t e r c u t t i n g : agnates a t workstations watching on visors. in the
      subway watching on platform banner. in the plaza watching on the
      glass wall. an agnate in an apartment, watching on a wall panel.
      p / b j u m p cut to: a still image of starkweather's storage tank.
      t h e blinking grid of bio-monitors. t h e shadow in the block of ice.

      we are still   in the apartment when the playback cuts out. the
      agnate looks    around as every piece of glass dissolves to trans-
      parency. the    mirror panels, the frosted walls, the window, which
      now shows no    view at all. just the gleam of a holographic lens.
