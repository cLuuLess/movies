     the proxy of starkweather spins over the desk. merrick regards
     i t with a frown. scheer sits turning the ethercuff i n his fingers
     with a demeanor of cool curiosity. underneath, he's rattled.

                               scheer
                    you want to tell me what's going on?

                                   merrick
                    there's nothing going on, karl.

                               scheer
                    i'm jaded. not stupid.

                                  merrick
                    what's your point?

                             scheer
                    i checked up. in the past year, three
                    products have destabilized. all of them
                    deltas... and there's nothing going on?

                                  merrick
                    you're jumping to conclusions.

                                scheer
                    once i can overlook. twice i can call
                    coincidence. three times i start giving
                    a shit. because if these products are
                    defective...

                                   merrick
                    q u a l i t y control is not your concern.

                                                               42.



                        scheer
              s o it is a quality control issue?

                            merrick
              that's not what i said.

                        scheer
              he was in the subway tunnels for two
              days. in the dark, no food, no water.
              his fingers were scraped to the bone.
              he was trying to dig his way out. now
              you try to explain to me why that is.

his look says he smells a rat. merrick weighs him a moment. then
sighs, a little depleted. he gets up and crosses to the glass
wall. looks down on the avenue, at the agnates m i l l i n g beneath.

                               merrick
              it's not an exact science - biogenesis.
              there's a degree of trial and error. if
              the agnate doesn't come together on the
              first pass, we have to abort and start
              over. it's like breaking inertia. the
              bioreactor, the growth medium - we just
              keep upping the levels till we achieve
              integration. at which stage the agnate
              is deemed physically stable. we rely on
              foundation to provide mental stability -
              matching the templates to their capacity
              but walling it in with parameters.
                     ( b e a t , considers the proxy)
              when signs of instability started to
              show up, it pointed to foundation. a
              hole in the wall, an oversight. but it
              was only happening in the later generat-
              ions . which pointed back to biogenesis.

                        scheer
              so there was a production defect.

                              merrick
              actually the opposite. we found out in
              the later generations, the levels were
              so high that when we broke inertia, the
              process kept going. over-integrating.
              specifically the neural system. it
              produced a condition called synesthesia.

                       scheer
              synesthesia...

                                                                  43.



                             merrick
               a fusion of the senses, creating a
               component awareness. sixth sense,
               s e c o n d sight, whatever you want to call
               it. its emergence seems to be arbitrary.
               but it gives them experiences beyond
               their functional parameters. and
               ultimately... it destabilizes them.
               however, if we catch it early enough we
               can control it with re-conditioning.

scheer absorbs this with a slow grin. merrick looks puzzled.

                          merrick
               you find this amusing?

                          scheer
               poetic.

                          merrick
               poetic?

                           scheer
               this "agnate" took off just before his
               sponsor placed an order. maybe he got
               the sense his days were numbered...

merrick ' s composure cracks a little. he hadn't thought of this.

                           merrick
               this stays between you and me, karl. i
               trust i can rely on your cooperation?

                            scheer
               don't you mean my complicity?

                                merrick
                      (hardening again)
               remind me, why is it you were
               discharged from the military?

                             scheer
               what's your point?

                            merrick
               learn to be a team player, karl. or
               you'll find yourself out of another
               job.

scheer rises, discarding the ethercuff onto merrick's desk.

                             scheer
               nobody else would take it.

                                                                     44.
