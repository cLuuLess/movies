101   int . the glass villa - night

      silence. still. sanger sits nursing a cup of herb tea. crowne
      sits smoking. stubs in the ashtray speak of long hours waiting.
      the still is broken as merrick emerges from an adjacent room.
      sanger and crowne look up, expectant. merrick closes the door
      with slow care. then he faces them, a grim tenor in his voice-

                                   merrick
                     bad news.
