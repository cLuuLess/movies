102   ext . phoenix - night

      the whisper slices the night, running lights blinking. we pan to
      frame it against a skyline of black towers. a glittering row of
      domes and spires, somehow celestial, touching the sky. the city
      bears no trace of its origins, once built over indian ruins, now
      rebuilt, subsumed by urban overhaul. it has become a metropolis.

                                                                        69.
