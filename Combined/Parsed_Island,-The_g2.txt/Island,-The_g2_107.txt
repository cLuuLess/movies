      f a s t food outlets have evidently changed little. promotional
      posters in 3d: "ham slam", "porker forkers", "bacon blitz".

                                                                     75.



      service counter, seating area. ester is looking around like
      alice in wonderland. lincoln comes up, out of breath, edgy-

                              lincoln
                     i told you to stay with me.

                                     ester
                           ( i n n o c e n t , plaintive)
                     i'm hungry.

                                  lincoln
                     o k a y . okay...

      he nods, realizing he is too. he plants ester in a seat and looks
      around. people stand in line transacting, receiving food trays.
      not unlike nutrition plaza. lincoln ventures to the counter. he
      offers the blue card hopefully. the service clerk looks at him-

                                t h e service clerk
                     a r e you gonna tell me what you want?

                                      lincoln
                            ( b e a t , no other reference)
                     what are my options?

                                  t h e service clerk
                     k n o c k yourself out, buddy.

      he indicates a menu above. lincoln assimilates, looking up at
      the menu. understanding now, his face lifts to almost a smile.
      it's the first time he's been given an unrestricted choice.
