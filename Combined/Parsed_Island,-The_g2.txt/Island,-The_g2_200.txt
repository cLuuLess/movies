      p e a c e . sunlight. a bell tolling in the background. we make out
      katherine, dressed in black, standing at a grave. the headstone
      reads simply: "here lies ester & her unborn son - may they rest
      in peace". there are no dates. katherine lays down some flowers
      then looks across at dr. abrams. as he escorts her away, we see
      crowne crossing towards them. she introduces herself delicately-

                                crowne
                    m r s . ester? my name is ellen crowne.
