     the crosshatch emblem spins on a wall-to-wall screen. not a real
     screen but a projected flat known as a "holoframe". here, lydia
     assembles the tour group, nursing wine glasses and canapes. the
     holoframe fades up a serene music track and a commercial begins:
     a series of vignettes; an old man shuffling on a walking frame --
     a middle-aged woman in a bathing suit, one breast flattened by a
     mastectomy -- a young woman in labor, her face knotted in pain.
     the group watches with frowns and disapproving mumbles. then-

                                v o i c e (o.s.)
                    i t ' s not a pretty sight, is it?
     e y e s turn to a figure behind them, dressed in a vestmental w h i t e
     labcoat - 70's, tall, slightly hunched by senility, eyes like
     quicksilver, glittering. he has the hauteur of a visionary
     stooping to the role of a salesman. his name is dr. henry sanger.

                                      dr. sanger (cont'd)
                    m o r t a l i t y . we all know its face and yet
                    w e look away, don't we? we deny that our
                    l i v e s are ordained to suffering. that
                    w e are all, inalterably, going to die.

     he pauses, fielding the various disconcerted looks. then smiles.

                                dr. sanger
                    i t takes courage to confront mortality,
                    my friends. and i see it in each of
                    y o u . my name is dr. henry sanger and
                    i'm here to reward your courage.
     l y d i a applauds. the tour group dutifully follows suit. sanger
     whispers a question in lydia's ear. she broadcasts her response-

                                   lydia
                    t o d a y ' s group is from new gaza health
                    care. they're with the platinum plan.

                               dr. sanger
                    n e w gaza. yes, very good oncology unit.

     m u l l i n g this, he ambles through the holoframe which ripples at
     his passage. rallied by lydia the tour group follows him into--

                                                                  19.
