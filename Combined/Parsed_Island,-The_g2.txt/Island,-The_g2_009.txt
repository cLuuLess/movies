11   int. bedroom - lincoln's apartment - the next day

     the horizon. the morning sun streams over the green mountains.
     lincoln lies sleeping, his head buried under the pillow. off a
     beeping sound, he stirs and squints up at the mirrored ceiling:

     - - ether call pending ; accept or send to message bank?

                                   lincoln
                       accept.

     the etherscreen resolves ester's face, fresh and bright.

                                       ester (on etherscreen)
                       lincoln? i missed you at breakfast.

                                lincoln
                       i guess i overslept.

                                ester (on etherscreen)
                       i just wanted to check we're still on
                       for tonight. the interact.

                                     lincoln
                       right. i'll be there.

                                   ester (on etherscreen)
                       i'll see you then. enjoy your day!

     her face blinks out. lincoln gets out of bed with a smile.
