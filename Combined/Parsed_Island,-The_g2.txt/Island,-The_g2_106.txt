108   ext . street - day

      the sunlight flares off passing vehicles, hypnotic. the faces of
      pedestrians flash past. lincoln and ester wander in thrall up the
      street. everywhere new sights, new curiosities bombard them...

      the storefronts, mysterious recesses behind polarized glass. the
      glass, alive with pixellated g r a p h i c s , marquees: "temps! temps!
      new tech opportunities!" - "beauty therapy! manicures, dermals,
      follicle grafts!" - "discount legal service! class actions only!"

      h o l o f r a m e b i l l b o a r d s loom over the street, huge shimmering
      panels like phantom jumbotrons, commercials playing on a loop:
      - - a businessman in a conference room, shrinking from a fierce
      negotiation; the scene replayed with the same businessman, now
      on his feet, stabbing his finger angrily in the air; a pill
      bottle in cu, a text super "combatrine! the aggression enhancer"
      - - a teenager bemused by his homework: his parents escorting him
      into a clinic; the teenager hooded by an electronic dome; his
      parents clapping; the teenager smiling as he accepts a diploma;
      a text super "intellex: data impression for a new generation"

      lincoln suddenly looks round, realizing ester is gone from his
      side. he scans the sea of faces. then spots her stepping through
      a doorway. over the threshold is a holoform: a pig with wings,
      circled by the legend "hog heaven! home of the true hamburger".
