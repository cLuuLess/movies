37   int. nutrition plaza - sector four - predawn

     the glass wall reprises the predawn glower. the plaza is empty
     at this hour. but the service counters are staffed as breakfast
     is being prepared. the clerk looks surprised to see lincoln
     arriving so early. he seems grim, latent, stiffly swiping his
     ethercuff o v e r the scanner. she eyes the readout on her screen-

                                   n u t r i t i o n clerk
                    lincoln six-echo... options are dried
                    fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.

                             lincoln
                    i want some bacon.

                               n u t r i t i o n clerk
                    you heard the options.

                               lincoln
                    an d coffee. i want coffee.
     the clerk sighs and taps her screen. turning to the chutes, she
     collects a foil covered bowl and a juice can and sets them on
     lincoln's tray. lincoln glances down at it, then back up-

                                lincoln
                    this isn't what i asked for.

                               n u t r i t i o n clerk
                    you want to get into it? look, i just
                    work here, pal. i serve the meal and
                    make sure it goes down on your record.
     lincoln nods slowly. then picks up the bowl. and flings i t across
     the plaza. then the juice can, trying to outdistance the bowl.
     finally, the tray, which rotors almost to the far side before
     clattering into obscurity. then he turns back to the clerk-

                               lincoln
                    p u t that on my fucking r e c o r d .
