93   int . the glass villa - day

     the flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude.
     the decor is minimalist with native american accents, kokopelli
     spirits in carved silhouette. dr. sanger stands at a glass wall,
     looking out across the green mountain valley. on the sofa sits
     merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. the air stirs
     as a maid ushers in a woman - 30's, all business, sharp blue
     eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. her name is ellen crowne.

                                crowne
                    good morning, gentlemen.

                                    sanger
                    bernard, this is ellen crowne from our
                    legal department. ellen, this is
                    bernard merrick, director of products.

                                 merrick
                    thank you for coming out here.

                                crowne
                    well when henry called me i got the
                    sense it wasn't for a social visit.

     they settle at a table. a jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out.

                             crowne
                    i understand there was an incident?

                                                                 60.



                            merrick
              first, let me stress there's no way we
              could have anticipated what happened...

                           crowne
              we're on the same team, mr. merrick.
              just give me the facts down-and-dirty.

                               merrick
                     (uneasy, clears his throat)
              we'v e lost two of our products. they
              escaped containment last night.

crowne casts a troubled look at sanger. merrick quickly adds-

                                merrick (cont'd)
               however, we have all available
               resources dedicated to the search.

                         crowne
              how exactly did this happen?

                           merrick
              we'r e still piecing it together.

                        crowne
              do we expect more products to escape?

                           dr. sanger
              don't be so alarmist, ellen.

                         crowne
              i'm sorry, henry, but you asked me
              here to assess our liabilities.

                        merrick
              to answer your question, we condition
              our products with a deterrent. a fear of
              contamination. and thereby of the outer
              environment. so to escape, they first
              have to escape their conditioning.

crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette.

                                crowne
              containment is one of the terms of our
              state health license. the fact it was
              compromised could put us in violation.

                       dr. sanger
              bureaucracy.

                                                  61.



              crowne
henry , it was a bloody battle getting
our license through in the first place.

                dr. sanger
they're not going to pull our license,
ellen. we have a lot of friends on the
commission. not to mention the goodwill
we earned in dc when we took over the
facility; a bunker complex for a bio-
chemical war that never happened... we
relieved them of a costly embarrassment.

           crowne
i'm not sure we can rely on that.

                dr. sanger
alright . what do you suggest?

              crowne
first, i need you to level with me.
what are our chances of finding them?

             merrick
well, in our favor, they've never been
outside containment. they'd have no
coordinates, no sense of direction.

         crowne
i don't see how that's in our favor.

               merrick
they're in the middle of the desert.
food and water become an issue.

          crowne
so they might return to the trough?

            merrick
possibly.

           crowne
and if not? how long could they last?

         merrick
a few days maybe. but there is another
variable. we maintain the products in a
sterile environment. so basically their
immune systems are untested. toxins,
pathogens, environmentals t h e rest of
us overcome routinely, to them...

                                                               62.



                             dr. sanger
               that's a little drastic. some immune
               systems are more adaptive than others.

                            crowne
               let's take the drastic case. what then?

                              merrick
               well . . . the male, we could cover. fast-
               track another generation before the
               sponsor ever needed access. the female
               comes under the maternity plan. she's
               three months pregnant. even if we fast-
               tracked another generation, we couldn't
               fast-track the pregnancy. we'd miss the
               delivery date, the sponsor would wonder
               why and there would be... difficulties.

crowne looks worried. sanger pours a glass of icewater.

                           dr. sanger
               even so, the worst may not happen.

                         crowne
               we haven't even touched on the worst. if
               these products reach a populated area,
               there's the problem of scrutiny.
                             dr. sanger
               ellen , we operate under state license on
               a lease from the federal government...

                             crowne
                    ( c u t s him off, harshly)
               we slipped through a loophole in the
               clone laws, henry. and they only let
               u s through because they smelt money.
               and they gave us a government basement
               to cover their own a s s e s not ours. it's
               at the core of our license - why we
               screen potential sponsors, why we make
               them sign discretion agreements, why
               containment is such a critical factor -
               to limit the extent of public scrutiny.

                             dr. sanger
               e i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get
               that far. it's at least twenty miles to
               the next settlement. right, bernard?

merrick hesitates before nodding his assent. crowne pounces on it-

                                                                    63.



                                     crowne
                    something to add, mr. merrick?

                                    merrick
                    i just don't think we should under-
                    estimate them. especially the male.

                               dr. sanger
                    and i don't think we should panic.

     he cautions merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill
     from a bottle. crowne looks forward to both men. very serious.

                                      crowne
                    gentlemen, whatever happens we need
                    t o keep one thing clearly in mind. as
                    far as the world at large goes, we are
                    just another medical services company.
                    anything that alters that perception
                    puts us at risk. and we cannot rely on
                    the sanction of the law to protect us.
                    whenever and wherever and in whatever
                    condition we recover these products, we
                    have to stay beyond reproach. all it
                    takes is one nudge to put us in the
                    spotlight. then you'll see how fast
                    politicians can run for cover.

     merrick shifts, uneasy. sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile-

                              dr. sanger
                    i n other words we need to find them
                    o r else. that's very astute, ellen.
