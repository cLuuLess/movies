142   int . store - morning

      l i g h t s flicker on to disclose a gunshop. the array of firearms
      a s fathomless as their purpose. the scruffy gunshop o w n e r slouches
      inside. diggs and burdon enter on his heels. he yawns at them-

                               g u n s h o p owner
                     we ain't open for another hour.

                                  diggs
                     y e a h , well we ain't in the market.

                                       g u n s h o p owner
                     e v e r y o n e ' s in the market, pal. one end
                     of the barrel or the other...

                                  diggs
                     we ' r e chasing up a currency record from
                     last night. these two ring a bell?
      d i g g s displays two digital slides. the owner pauses, suspicious.

                                 g u n s h o p owner
                     what are you? cops? lawyers?
      d i g g s answers by jerking out the rainmaker. the twin barrels
      aimed at his head, the gunshop o w n e r loses his cool a little-

                                 g u n s h o p owner
                     h i m , i remember... came in just before
                     closing... wanted a shooter but didn't
                     have no id... settled for one of these.

      he displays a hunting knife, unsheathing it, showing the blade.

                                diggs
                     did he give you a name?

                                g u n s h o p owner
                     no.

                                                                    94.



                                diggs
                     did he say where he was going?
                                 g u n s h o p owner
                     no.

      d i g g s cocks the hammer. the owner flinches. then, off the knife-

                                  g u n s h o p owner
                     the r e was one thing. kinda w e i r d .
                     he wanted to know how to use it...
