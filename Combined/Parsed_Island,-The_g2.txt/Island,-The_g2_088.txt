     in civvies, scanning the terrain with electronic binoculars. the
     flight console beeps. he taps a keypad. a holoframe resolves:

                                  censor (on holoframe)
                    ground team checking in.

                                 scheer
                    anything?

                               censor (on holoframe)
                    the storm pretty much covered their
                    tracks. we're scanning for thermals
                    b u t the hotter it gets, the harder it
                    is to isolate a heat signature. i don't
                    know, sir, it's a big desert out there.
