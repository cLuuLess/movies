      a grill bar. a rank of vending machines. ester moves through the
      seating area as if drawn. now over the ambient noise, we isolate
      the cry of a baby. ester is following the sound to its source.
      she finds a mexican woman shushing her infant. the woman looks
      up and smiles. ester just stands there, awe-struck. lincoln now
      comes up to reclaim her. he's about to ask why she wandered off
      when she turns to him. he sees her eyes are brimming with tears.
      tears of joy and sorrow. it's the first time she's seen a baby.
