     merrick   is at his console, working late. off a buzz, he taps a
     button.   the door opens and an outsider enters - 40's, square set,
     hollow,   remote eyes. his hair is damp and he wears post-decon
     scrubs.   a usmc ring is visible on his finger. his name is scheer.

                                    merrick
                     k a r l . . . welcome back.

     s c h e e r pauses, his face twitching. then sneezes violently.

                              scheer
                     i forgot how much i hate the air here.

                                 merrick
                     j u s t a histamine reflex. your system's
                     readjusting to the sterile environment.

                                 scheer
                     i t ' s the smell i hate. empty.

                                 merrick
                     yes , well i cut short your leave for a
                     reason. i take it you've been briefed?

                                                                     32.



                                scheer
                      ( s i t s , sniffing)
                o n e of our lab rats is missing.
w i t h a dour look, merrick slots his etherboard i n t o a dock. a
proxy resolves over the console, quarter scale, spinning in 3d;
male, african american, bull neck. data etches across thin air:

- - p r o d u c t id: starkweather; foundation: ii; generation: delta;
- - i n t e g r a t i o n date: 01/27/84 // containment ref: 102, sector 4

                           merrick
                his name is starkweather two-delta. he
                dropped off the ether two days ago. at
                first we thought it was a system error.
                then we found this in a garbage chute.

he opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. he hands it to
scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds. then-

                             scheer
                d e l t a generation, huh?

                              merrick
                that's right.

                          scheer
                i t was a delta the last time.

                            merrick
                t h a t was entirely different. the
                product suffered a head injury.
                            scheer
                what happened to this one?

                          merrick
                we don't know. he just disappeared.
                           scheer
                n o t easy to disappear. unless he
                figured a way through the boundary.

                            merrick
                he's a code two, karl. a low functioner.
                          scheer
                i f you ask me, it's a mistake giving
                them any functions at all.

                            merrick
                the y don't function mentally, they don't
                function physically - you know that.

                                                                      33.



                           scheer
               the n perhaps if you're going to breed
               lab rats, you should breed them tame.
his look, albeit from a distance, throws a stone. merrick hardens-

                         merrick
               i f you bothered to read the clone laws,
               you'd realize we have no choice in the
               matter. the virtual humanity statutes
               accord them a set of freedoms. all we
               can do is prescribe the limits. and
               even those are subject to regulation.
               scope of knowledge, range of activity,
               even their speech patterns. the law
               requires that what is of human origin
               be provided with human characteristics.

                          scheer
               you mean, like fallibility?
merrick pauses. he's not going to take the bait.

                          merrick
               the ether shows no attempts on the
               boundary. he's here, karl. but for
               some reason, your men seem unable to
               find him. it's your job to contain the
               products. i'd like you to do it, okay?

                        scheer
               a little sensitive, aren't we?

                           merrick
               j u s t after starkweather went missing,
               his sponsor placed an order. an order we
               can't fill. damn right i'm sensitive.

                               scheer
               a l r i g h t . how much time do i have?

merrick taps a button. a holoframe appears beside the proxy.
even in two dimensions, the face is identical. just a different
hairstyle and a gold earring. this is the face of the sponsor.

                               merrick
               j a m i l starkweather . . . last week he
               sustained a hepatic trauma resulting in
               liver hemorrhage. in medical terms, we
               have maybe a few weeks. in legal terms,
               we're already o n borrowed time...
                      ( a s scheer rises to leave)
               an d karl?

                                                                            34.



                                   merrick (cont'd)
                      i don't want a godawful m e s s like the
                      l a s t time. minimal damage. understood?
