16   int . construction zone - sector six - day

     an arc of blue light. a uniformed worker steers a plasma torch
     over a conduit. in the fog of smoke, we see wires being spliced,
     circuits, tested. outsiders in hardhats, goggles and cup masks.
     lincoln comes over the crosswalk, starkly contrasted in dacron
     coveralls and a hooded gasmask. the crew foreman intercepts him -
     drawn, desiccated features, a husky drawl. his name is mccord-

                                      mccord
                        sorry, chief. i can't let you get any
                        closer. we got live wires over there.

     lincoln's reply is muffled by the gasmask, lost in the noise.

                                      mccord
                        what's that you said?

     lincoln repeats to no avail. frustrated, he peels off his gasmask-

                                 lincoln
                        i said i can't hear you.
     m c c o r d c h u c k l e s at the irony.

                                                                      15.



                                mccord
                    he y , you get yourself contaminated,
                    don't come pointing the finger at me.
                               lincoln
                    how are you doing, mac?

                               mccord
                    you know how it is. `gets to the end of
                    shift, `crew starts draggin t h e i r feet.

                                lincoln
                    we l l the guys upstairs are griping
                    about the backlog. they want to know
                    when you'll be ready for move in.
                             mccord
                    i guess if we bust our backs, we could
                    be out of here by the end of the week.

                                lincoln
                    i'll tell them two weeks.

                                   mccord
                    thanks , chief. i appreciate that.

                                 lincoln
                    so . . . got any stuff on you today?
