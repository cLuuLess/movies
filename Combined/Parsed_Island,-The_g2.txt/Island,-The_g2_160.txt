162   int . pithouse - night - later

      ester stirs from slumber. on the ground beside her, she finds a
      bowl of food and a water gallon. now through the gloom, she sees
      lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil.
      something seems different about him as he turns, registering her-

                                lincoln
                     a r e you alright?

                              ester
                     i feel better after i sleep.

      lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. ester
      moves closer, sensing something. he speaks as if from far away-

                                                                      105.



                                lincoln
                     the man out there... he said
                     everything has a spirit... every
                     living thing... but not...

      his voice cuts off. ester looks at him, recognizing his pain.
      she doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. it's pain
      and it evokes a response in her. a feeling, taking her over. her
      hand reaches out and strokes his hair. lincoln looks up at her,
      questioning. with supreme knowing, ester leans down and kisses
      him. at the touch of her lips, lincoln pauses. the first kiss
      for both of them but ester takes it in her stride. the calm
      ballet of nature. fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts
      steeping with moonlight. lincoln rising to face her, feeling her
      proximity, her radiant heat. his fingers touching her breasts.
      ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. lincoln closing
      his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. he yields to it,
      returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.
