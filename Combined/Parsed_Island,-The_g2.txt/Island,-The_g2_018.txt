20   int . entrance hall - the sanger institute - day

     the polarized glass shows the liner has docked and a tour group
     is disembarking. the men are mostly over 40, bloated by luxury.
     the women, mostly under 30, wives and girlfriends, all jewels and
     haute couture. they filter into the entrance hall to be greeted
     by the courtesy staff. pretty girls in short skirts and blazers
     with the crosshatch insignia, led by a pert redhead named lydia.

                                  lydia
                    l a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is lydia
                    and on behalf of our staff, i'd like
                    t o welcome you to the sanger institute.

                                                                          18.

                                    lydia (cont'd)
                    before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                    i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                    and circulating our standard discretion
                    agreements. i should add that today you
                    are all very lucky because our ceo and
                    founder, dr. henry sanger, is with us
                    and will be leading the tour personally.
