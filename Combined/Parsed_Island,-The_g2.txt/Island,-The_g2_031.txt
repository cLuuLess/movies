33   int . lincoln's apartment - predawn

     the horizon. the green mountains cast black by the predawn
     glower. lincoln sits rigidly hunched on his bed, still in
     yesterday's clothes, sleepless. he is staring fixedly out of the
     window, hungrily, as if inviting the outer darkness to come in.

     his gaze lowers onto his jacket, slung across the bed. he digs
     in the pocket. and pulls out the cigarette pack. for a moment he
     considers it. then slowly, purposefully, he opens it. he slips a
     cigarette between his lips. and lights up. he leans back, taking
     a slow drag. exhaling, he watches the smoke rise. his gaze rests
     on the etherscreen above, expectant. the cursor comes to life:

     - - s c r e e n i n g . . . contaminant detected: advising sanitation ctrl

     r e f l e c t e d in the ceiling, lincoln grins at his small victory.
