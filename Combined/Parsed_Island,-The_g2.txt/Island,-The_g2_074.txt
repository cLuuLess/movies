76   int . / ext . the funnel - night

     a pov looking up. the funnel mouth framing a vista of the world
     outside. a hostile vista of black sky, maelstroms of sand. the
     sound of blasting air, suborned to the giant howl of a duststorm.
     a hand. reaching over the funnel lip as lincoln pulls himself up
     with a mighty effort. blinking, blinded by the sand, he swings
     astride the lip. then he reaches down to pull ester up. ester
     gains the lip and likewise swings astride, coughing, blinking.
     t h e dusty earth as lincoln leaps down to meet it. we track up as
     he helps ester down from the funnel. her feet meeting the earth,
     we are now in cu o n their faces. gaping and blinking at the
     prospect of the world outside. a world of darkness and storm.

     sudden blinding light as halogens explode the darkness. lincoln
     shields his eyes, scanning for their source. he spots a large
     cubic building, banks of spotlights on the roof. he pulls ester
     away. away from the lights and towards the safety of darkness.
