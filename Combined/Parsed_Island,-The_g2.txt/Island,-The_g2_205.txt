207   int . entrance hall - the sanger institute - day

      t h r o u g h the polarized glass we see the liner has docked. a tour
      group is disembarking. another parade of plutocracy, aging
      bloated me and brittle young women. they filter inside to be
      greeted by the courtesy staff, led by the ever-perky lydia.

                                     lydia
                     l a d i e s and gentlemen, my name is lydia
                     and on behalf of our staff, i'd like
                     t o welcome you to the sanger institute.
                     before we start the tour, we'll be serv-
                     i n g r e f r e s h m e n t s in the visitor center
                     and circulating our standard discretion
                     agreements. i should add that today you
                     are all very lucky because our ceo and
                     founder, dr. henry sanger, is with us
                     and will be leading the tour personally.
