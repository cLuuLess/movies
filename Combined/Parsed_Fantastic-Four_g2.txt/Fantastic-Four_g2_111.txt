               ext. street/alley - day

               sue wades through the throng of new yorkers.  tries to catch
               up with ben...whose presence parts the crowd like moses.

                                   sue
                         ben!  slow down...

               ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  she catches up.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         he didn't mean it.  you know johnny. 
                         he's always been a hothead --

                                   ben
                         it's not him.  it's them.
                             (pointing to crowd)
                         i can't live like this.

                                   sue
                         just give reed a little more time.
                         you know how he works -- analyzing
                         every little step before he takes
                         one --

                                   ben
                         it's easy for you to be patient.

                                   sue
                         no, it's not.  i thought i was done
                         waiting for reed... we're all in this
                         together now, ben.

               he slows down, gets closer, intense.

                                   ben
                         together?  look at me, susie.  you got
                         no idea what i'd give...to be
                         invisible.  your nightmare...is my
                         dream.

               she opens her mouth, but has no response.  she doesn't know
               his depth of pain.  as he disappears into the alley, we cut
               to --
