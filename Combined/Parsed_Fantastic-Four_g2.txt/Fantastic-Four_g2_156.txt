               johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the
               missile streaking closer.  as he moves, the missile shifts
               slightly with his motion!  his eyes narrow, thinking.

               he flames on a hand.  he waves his flaming hand, and the
               missile locks onto the fire!  johnny darkens, realizing...

                                   johnny
                         great.  heat-seeker.

               his mind races.  he makes a decision, and steps up onto the
               ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.

                                   sue
                         what are you doing --

                                   johnny
                         sis.  let me take care of you for
                         once.

                                   sue
                         but johnny...you can't fly.

               johnny considers, a half-beat.  he looks out.  under breath:

                                   johnny
                         well then this'll be one hell of a
                         basejump.

               sue reaches out to stop him, but johnny dives heroically off
               the edge!  he flames on!  the missile follows his arc.  as he
               drops, his clothes burn off, revealing his uniform.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                             (under breath)
                         come on...come on...come on...

               he falls lower, lower.  and...he...banks!  swoops up! 
               flying!

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         flame on.

               sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.

                                   ben
                         we need to help reed --

               sue shakes her head, sympathetic.

                                   sue
                         ben, you got what we all wanted. 
                         you need to stay here.  it's too
                         dangerous.

               she heads off.  ben watches her go, helpless.
