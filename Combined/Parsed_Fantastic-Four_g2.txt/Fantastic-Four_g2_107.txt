               int. baxter building - media room - day

               crash!  bang!  ben stalks around the room, furious.  reed and
               sue rush in.

                                   reed
                         ben!  what?  what's going on!?

               ben points to the wall-sized tv: the espn moto x games.

                                   x games reporter (on tv)
                         so what can you tell us about the
                         outfit?

               reveal: johnny standing next to an x games reporter.  he is
               peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,
               revealing his ff uniform, with a "4" stitched onto the chest.

               behind them, step up riders launch their moto-bikes off huge
               18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.

                                   johnny (on tv)
                         not too much, but i will say that it's
                         all weather and no leather.  kind of
                         armani meets astronaut.

               ben, sue, and reed stare at the wall-sized tv.  mouths agape.

                                   sue
                         he didn't.

                                   ben
                         oh, he did.

                                   sue
                         what did he do to the uniform?!

               she turns to reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back
               his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.

                                   reed
                         he talked me into it.

                                   x-games reporter (on tv)
                         so what are your superhero names?

                                   johnny (on tv)
                         i go by the human torch.  the ladies
                         call me torch.

                                   x-games reporter (on tv)
                         what about the rest of the team?

               johnny hadn't really thought about them.  he spitballs:

                                   johnny (on tv)
                         uh, we call my sister the invisible
                         girl...the invisible girl.

                                   sue
                         girl...?!

                                   x-games reporter (on tv)
                         that's easy to remember.  and reed
                         richards?  he's the leader.  so
                         what's he?  mr. fantastic?

                                   johnny
                         well, i wouldn't say he's the leader.

               reed shrugs.  he doesn't hate the name.

                                   ben
                         could be worse.

               case in point: a photo of ben fills the tv.

                                   x-games reporter (on tv)
                         what about this one?  what do you call
                         this thing?

               johnny smiles, looking right into camera.

                                   johnny
                         that's it.  just the thing.  we would
                         have gone with the rock, but it was
                         taken.  and "thing" pretty much sums
                         it up.

               a laugh from the studio audience.

                                   ben
                             (matter-of-fact)
                         okay.  i'm gonna go kill him now.

               he turns to go.  reed wraps an arm around ben.

                                   reed
                         ben!  slow down a second and --

               he sees a photo of himself on screen.

                                   x-games reporter (on tv)
                         is it true what they say?  that he can
                         expand any part of his anatomy?

                                   johnny (on tv)
                         actually, between us, i think he's got
                         some problems staying rigid.

                                   reed
                             (finishing his thought to ben)
                         ...wait for me...

                                   x-games reporter (on tv)
                         which may explain why this woman's
                         not smiling.

               they put up a shot of susan.

                                   sue
                         i'm driving.

                                   johnny (on tv)
                         dude.  that's my sister.
