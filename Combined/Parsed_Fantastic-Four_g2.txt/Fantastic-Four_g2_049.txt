               int. von doom compound - ben's room - early evening

                                   reed (o.s.)
                         ben, are you there?

               a creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and
               gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the
               contours of ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough
               and craggy.  sound of grinding heavy rocks.

                                   sue (o.s.)
                         open up ben, we need to talk.

               it all stops.  a beat, then all four legs of the bed give way
               and it crashes to the floor.  under the covers, he groans in
               pain, and his voice is deeper, gravely, but definitely clear:

                                   ben
                         leave me alone!!!
