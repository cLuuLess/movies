               ben puts the seat down, with the driver on it.  he lunges
               behind a truck.  the cops try to follow, but flames push them
               back.  ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.

               he tries to hide from onlookers around him and pedestrians on
               walkways overhead.  he wants to escape, but hears screaming
               motorists.  he grits his teeth, and moves to help them.
