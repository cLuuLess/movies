               int. von doom industries tower - elevator - moments later

               reed and ben step into the elevator.

                                   ben
                         he knew about nasa.  what if he made
                         the call to shut us down --

                                   reed
                         ben, think about all the people we can
                         help if this works --

                                   ben
                         maybe you should think about yourself
                         for once.  you always let this guy
                         push you round --

                                   reed
                         we got what we wanted.  that's
                         enough.

                                   ben
                         i know, i know.  i'm just worried
                         about what he wants... speaking of
                         which...

               reed follows ben's eyes to...sue.  she joins them.  doors
               shut.
