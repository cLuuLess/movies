               int. transformation chamber - night

               leonard leads the thing inside.  the ominous chamber sits
               with its door open.  victor enters from the control station.

                                   victor
                         ben, come in.

                                   ben
                         what is this?  where's reed?

                                   victor
                         where do you think?  with sue.

               ben looks at the flickering lights.  suspicious.  victor
               turns to leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark
               room.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                             (quiet)
                         i'll take it from here, leonard.

               leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.

                                   leonard
                         yes sir.

               leonard disappears fast, as victor turns back to ben.

                                   ben
                         what do you want, vic?

                                   victor
                         to help you.  i've run every test
                         known to man.  and they all yield the
                         same result: the machine is ready.

               ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...

                                   ben
                         reed said it'd be weeks till --

                                   victor
                         he also said we'd avoid that storm in
                         space.  and we know how that turned
                         out.

               ben nods.  reed was wrong before.  ben gets closer to the
               machine, drawn to it.  he wants to believe, so badly.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         he couldn't generate enough power for
                         the machine to reach critical mass. 
                         yet another mistake for "mr.
                         fantastic."

                                   ben
                         and you can?  power it up?

               victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little spark
               around him.  the lights...?  or his skin...?

                                   victor
                         yes.  i've found a new energy source.

               he keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course
               with electricity.  it starts to build, sparking up his arm.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         tell me...do you want to be ben grimm
                         again?

               ben keeps his eyes on the machine.  his dream is alive.

                                   ben
                         let's do it.
