               int. baxter building - reversion lab - night

               inside the machine, the red cloud swirls with debris,
               crackling with light.  the chamber rattles dangerously, as
               the power seems to shake the very foundation of the building. 

               and then it's over.  the light dies down...somewhat.  it
               still pulses along with the chamber.  the chamber door slides
               open.

               beat.  and...ben grimm steps out.  not the thing.  no more
               rocks.  ben grimm.  naked, tired, but finally a normal man. 

               he slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  he
               collapses.  he stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

                                   ben
                         oh my god... th-thank you.  thank
                         you...vic?!

               ben sees a spark in shadows.  that spark is...

               victor's arm.  victor steps forward, and reveals himself to
               ben: electricity pumps through his body.  his skin is part
               flesh, part metal.  cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.

               he is doom.

                                   ben (cont'd)
                         vic... what the...?

                                   doom
                         everyone thought i was safe behind
                         those shields...

                                   ben
                         victor, the machine worked for me.  it
                         can work for you --

                                   doom
                         it did, ben.  it worked perfectly. 

               ben starts to realize...

                                   ben
                         you planned this...?

               doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- electricity builds from
               his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.

                                   doom
                         i've always wanted power.  now i've
                         got an unlimited supply...

                                   ben
                         and no thing to stand in your way. 

               doom smiles, nods, stronger than ben now.

                                   doom
                         take a good look, ben.  this is what a
                         man looks like who embraces his
                         destiny.

               doom clenches his fist and blasts ben, sending him flying
               backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.

                                   doom (cont'd)
                         one down, three to go.

               suddenly, whoosh!  the lab door flies open.  reed enters. 
               doom steps back into the shadows.

                                   doom (cont'd)
                         right on cue.

               reed's eyes go wide.  he sees ben crumpled in the corner.

                                   reed
                         oh god ben.  are you okay?
                             (amazed)
                         you did it, you really did it...

                                   doom
                         no, reed.  i did.

               reed slowly turns to see...doom.  his body, his face.

                                   reed
                         victor...?  what, what happened to
                         you?  what did you do to your --

                                   doom
                         exactly what i said i would: i built a
                         better, stronger being.  and
                         outsmarted the great reed richards --

                                   reed
                         victor, this isn't the way to --

                                   doom
                             (a dark smile)
                         you always know best.  so tell me. 
                         what happens when you superheat
                         rubber?

               doom blasts an electrical bolt at reed, knocking reed through
               the huge window!  reed's body rubber-bands from the blast.
