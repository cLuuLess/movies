               int. von doom compound - hallway - early evening

               double doors burst open.  reed, sue, and johnny urgently
               walk.

                                   sue
                         it has to be the cloud.  it's
                         fundamentally altered our dna.

                                   reed
                         let's not jump to conclusions, we need
                         a massive amount of evidence before
                         making that leap.

               reed glances over his shoulder.  he stares.  sue follows his
               gaze to see: johnny's fingertips are on fire.  he snaps his
               fingers.  they go out.  he's totally unharmed.

                                   johnny
                         now what is up with that?

                                   reed
                             (deadpan)
                         the cloud has fundamentally altered
                         our dna.

                                   johnny
                         cool.  what'd it do to you guys?

                                   sue
                         apparently i can disappear.

                                   johnny
                         please tell me you go silent too. 

               only one thing on reed's mind --

                                   reed
                         we have to find ben.
