               reed, sue, ben and johnny sit together, getting changed. 
               they get ready to go, but the chief fireman enters, stopping
               them.

                                   chief fireman
                         there's some folks outside, want to
                         talk to you.

                                   reed
                         we're not going public with this. 
                         we're scientists, not celebrities.

                                   chief fireman
                         too late, son.

               he turns on a little tv monitor in the corner.  news footage
               plays on all stations, with the tagline: fantastic four.

                                   chief fireman (cont'd)
                         that's what they're calling you.  the
                         fantastic four.

                                   johnny
                         nice.

               johnny heads for the exit.

                                   sue
                         johnny, slow down.  let's think this
                         through, a second.

               johnny pauses.  rubs his chin once.  and...

                                   johnny
                         okay.  done thinking.

               he runs out.  sue, ben, and reed swap glances, knowing johnny
               cannot be their spokesman.  they take off after him, out to --
