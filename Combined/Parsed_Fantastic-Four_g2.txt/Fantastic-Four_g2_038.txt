               int. von doom compound hospital corridor/sue's room - day

               reed walks down the hall.  his hair is graying at the
               temples.  he passes johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying
               his joke on ben.  johnny slows, looking at reed's hair.

                                   johnny
                         nice 'do.  going for the "grandpa"
                         look?

               reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  he
               keeps going.  he passes a partially open door.  he stops when
               he catches a glimpse of sue asleep in bed.  he sees a vase of
               flowers.  he grabs a couple lilies, and enters.

               but reed sees...the room is already filled with expensive
               flowers.  all from victor.  reed is trumped once again.

               a doctor writes on sue's chart.  a wall tv plays a press
               conference with victor, outside the facility.  he looks worse
               for wear.  a few hairs out of place, and a small bandage on
               his face.  we push into the press conference --

                                   reporter #1
                         you've been accused in the past of
                         moving science a little too fast --

                                   victor
                         accused by who?  my competitors?

                                   reporter #2
                         but surely this accident gives you
                         pause --

                                   victor
                         danger is always part of discovery. 
                         what would have happened if ben
                         franklin never went out in a storm?
                         without risk, there's no reward.

                                   reporter #3
                         so where's the reward?  you promised a
                         cure-all.

               victor pauses.  for the first time.  just a flicker.

                                   victor
                         and you'll have it.  i've never come
                         up short.  and i'm not going to start
                         now.

                                   reporter #2
                         so you're still taking vdi public --

                                   victor
                         yes, of course.  i've never been more
                         confident in the compan--

               reed mutes the television.

                                   reed
                         how's she doing?

                                   doctor
                         stable.  vitals are strong.

               reed takes the clipboard, looks for himself.

                                   reed
                         blood panels show no irradiation. 
                         good.  you'll step up this protocol,
                         every --

                                   doctor
                         four hours.  we know what we're
                         doing... one more day of observation,
                         then you're all cleared. 

               the doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  reed steps to
               sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  quiet:

                                   reed
                         sue...i want to tell you...i'm...

               whoosh.  a nurse rolls in with a tray bearing ten more
               extravagant bouquets.  reed looks resigned.  he walks out.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         she's allergic to orchids.  put that
                         amaryllis apapathos by her bed.  the
                         african lilies?  they're her
                         favorites.

               reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash. 

               sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.
