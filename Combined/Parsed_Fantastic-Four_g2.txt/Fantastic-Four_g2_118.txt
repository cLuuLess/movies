               ext. brooklyn streets - day

               ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,
               mind tossing and turning.  people stare, point.  a little
               girl and friend run up to him.

                                   little girl
                         mister, mister!  please help me!  my
                         kitty is stuck in a tree.

               she gestures to a tree next to ben.  looks up.

                                   little girl (cont'd)
                         please save miss lucy.

               ben rolls his eyes.  looks up.  considers climbing the tree,
               but thinks better of it.  he has another idea...

               ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap
               out of it.  meeeeeeooooooowwwwrrrrrrr!!!!

               the cat falls into frame.  at the last instant, ben sticks
               out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  he hands
               the cat to the girl.  barely acknowledges her profuse thanks. 
               he just moves on.
