               int. hayden planetarium - night

               stars on the ceiling.  a voice drones about the galaxy.  in
               the last row, we find: reed and sue.  reed is thinking about
               work.

                                   reed
                         i could get ben to tap into the
                         baxter's main power to generate enough
                         voltage --

                                   sue
                         reed.  shh.  just be quiet.  and look
                         up.

               he slowly looks up.  the stars seem to calm him.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         remember our first date here...?  god,
                         i was so nervous.

                                   reed
                         you were?

                                   sue
                         of course i was.  i'd read all your
                         papers on bioethics.  some of them two
                         times just so i'd have something to
                         say to you.

               reed smiles softly, thinking back.

                                   reed
                         you know, i bribed the projectionist
                         ten bucks to keep it open late?

                                   sue
                         i gave him twenty.

               they laugh.  sue looks up to the stars.  quiet:

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         i didn't want that night to end.

               reed looks at her.  wrestles with a decision.  then quietly:

                                   reed
                         sue, you were right.  it wasn't
                         complicated.  i just wasn't ready to
                         be...to become...
                             (a beat)
                         you can be a little intimidating. 

               she knows.  he trails off.  sue looks at him.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         you always talked about how you liked
                         the kind of man who could approach
                         you...speak his mind.  one who wasn't
                         afraid to tell you what he wanted.

                                   sue
                         i did.  i did, reed...but i wanted
                         you to be that man.

               someone shushes them.  they slump down further.  closer.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         when i walked out, i waited ten
                         minutes outside your door.  ten. 
                         waiting for you to come find me.

                                   reed
                         why didn't you say something?

                                   sue
                         that would have kinda defeated the
                         purpose.  and reed...
                             (closer, emotional)
                         i'm saying it now.

               their eyes lock.  a heated beat.  no more secrets.  their
               faces are close.  a kiss is coming.  closer, closer.  sue
               disappears.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                             (quiet, playful)
                         come find me.

               reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...

                                   sue (o.s.) (cont'd)
                         that's my nose, genius... these are my
                         lips.

               reed's face is squeezed on both sides by sue's invisible
               hands.  she pulls him into a kiss.  lips touch.  soft,
               tender.  stars twinkle.  and we slowly dissolve to --
