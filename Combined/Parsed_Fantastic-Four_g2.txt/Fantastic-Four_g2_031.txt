               clutching the diamond ring, victor stands defiantly.  showing
               absolutely no concern for the others.  interested only in the
               event itself.  lights and equipment fall, crashing around
               him.

               a control panel explodes in victor's face.  he jumps back,
               and into the falling equipment.  collapses under the weight.
