               sue looks at johnny, more disappointed than angry.

                                   sue
                         damn it, johnny.

               she goes after ben, leaving reed and johnny on the sidewalk.

                                   reed
                         you need to control yourself and think
                         before you --

                                   johnny
                         act.  here we go again.  reed, what if
                         we got these gifts for a reason?  what
                         if we have some, you know...like,
                         calling?

                                   reed
                         a higher calling like getting girls
                         and making money?

               johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

                                   johnny
                         is there any higher?

               reed looks at him, disgusted.  johnny waves to the crowd,
               hand flaming.  people shriek, snap pictures.  johnny smiles at
               reed.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         this is who we are reed.  accept it. 
                         or better yet: enjoy it.

               johnny steps into the sea of fans.  reed stands alone.
