               int. space station - command center/observation deck - same

               sue watches the monitor, also helpless.

                                   sue
                         johnny... reed...

               victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to
               sue.  practically shoves her aside as he hits the intercom.

                                   victor
                         reed, you need to get up here so we
                         can close the shields!  now!

               sue glares at victor.  his lack of compassion shocks her.

                                   reed (on radio)
                         not until ben is back inside!

                                   victor
                         it's too late for him, and soon it'll
                         be too late for all of us.

               victor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  he takes over
               the console, punching keys.

                                   sue
                         what are you doing?

                                   victor
                         raising the shields.

                                   sue
                         you can't leave them out there.

               sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.

                                   victor
                         watch me.  reed had his chance.  you
                         can't help them any more than i can.

               beat.  she takes a step toward the door.  not sure what to
               do.

                                   sue
                         i can try.

               with one final glare, she bolts from the room.
