               int. von doom industries - victor's office - day

               close on: an x-ray.  victor's arm.  the metallic
               transformation is higher now.  pull back to reveal: victor
               and his doctor.  in the wall behind them: ancient armor
               (maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  it adds a little
               menace to the room.

                                   doctor
                         your tissue, your organs, your entire
                         biophysical structure is changing. 
                         every system is still functioning,
                         somehow --

                                   victor
                         and they're changing into...

                                   doctor
                         i don't really know.  a compound
                         organic-metallic alloy.  stronger than
                         titanium or carbon steel.  harder than
                         diamonds --

                                   victor
                         like the shields reed said would
                         protect us.
                             (cold fury, deadly focus)
                         how long?

                                   doctor
                         at this rate, the infection should be
                         complete in two, maybe three weeks --

                                   victor
                         what do you mean "complete"?

                                   doctor
                         i wish i could tell you.  i can't
                         pretend to know what we're dealing
                         with here.  i'll notify the cdc and --

               victor hardens, razor sharp.

                                   victor
                         what?

                                   doctor
                         the center for disease control.  if
                         this thing is contagious --

               whhm!  victor grabs the doctor by the throat.

                                   victor
                         look at me.  i have a life.  i'm the
                         face of a billion-dollar-company... we
                         need to keep this confidential,
                         understand?

               victor's grip tightens around the man's throat.

                                   doctor
                         but...this disease...is progressive...
                         degenerative...

                                   victor
                         that's terrible news...

               with one cobra-swift move, victor thrusts his metallic arm
               into the doctor, killing him instantly.  victor retracts his
               arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         ...but i think i'll get a second
                         opinion.
