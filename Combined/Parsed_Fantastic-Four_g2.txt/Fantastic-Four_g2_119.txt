               ext. another brooklyn street - night

               ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses a large
               sculpture of his bust.

               he stops, steps back to take a look.  it's exquisitely
               rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the
               haunting anguish in his eyes.  ben is amazed, and touched,
               but...

                                   ben
                             (under breath)
                         eyebrows are a little big...

               a beat.  he stares at these images of himself.

                                   voice (o.s.)
                         i figured the only way to get you here
                         was to stick that in the window.

               he turns to see...alicia in the doorway.

                                   ben
                         how'd you know it was me?

                                   alicia
                         i'm blind, not deaf.  wanna come in?

               he steps toward her.  but he sees...a party in the back part
               of the gallery.  ben pauses, a little insecure.

                                   ben
                         i'm not really dressed for a party.

                                   alicia
                         relax, it's casual.

                                   ben
                         no, i mean...i'm a little...dusty... 

               she smiles, a thought forming, as we cut to --
