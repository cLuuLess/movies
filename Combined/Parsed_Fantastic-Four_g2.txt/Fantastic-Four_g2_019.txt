               int. space station - observation deck - same time

               behind his back, victor holds the ring box in hand.

                                   victor
                         you've been with me two years now.

               sue doesn't know where this is going.  she treads lightly.

                                   sue
                         it's been a good two years, victor...
                         the company's accomplished so much.

                                   victor
                         right, of course, the company... but
                         you see, i've come to realize all the
                         accomplishments in the world mean
                         nothing without someone to share them
                         with --

                                   sue
                         uh, victor, i hope i haven't done
                         something to make you think...

                                   victor
                         sue, i've lived my life unafraid of
                         taking big steps.  and this is the
                         biggest step yet.  if it helps, think
                         of this as a promotion.  a merger of
                         sorts...
                             (getting closer)
                         four little words that can change our
                         lives...

               he is about to spring the ring on her.  she looks like a deer
               in headlights.  she opens her mouth, and...wham!  doors slam
               open.  reed rushes into the room.

                                   reed
                         the cloud is accelerating!

               victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         i don't know what happened.

               sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify reed's
               claim.  starts punching buttons.  confirms reed's findings
               with a nod.  victor hardens, in control.

                                   reed (cont'd)
                         we've got minutes until it hits, not
                         hours...victor, that storm's deadly --
                         the radiation's lethal.  we need to
                         abort.

                                   victor
                         get a grip.  reed.  we didn't come all
                         this way to lose our nerve at the
                         first little glitch.  just close the
                         shields...

                                   reed
                         ben's still out there --

                                   victor
                         so reel him in.  but we came here to
                         do a job.  so let's do it.  quickly.
