               int. space station - command center/observation deck - same

               they enter the nerve center of the space station.  victor
               goes to a computer console on the observation deck below. 
               the windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.

                                   victor
                             (to ground; via comm-link)
                         leonard, how's the feed?

                                   leonard (v.o.)
                         recording, sir.  we see you perfectly.

               victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.

                                   sue
                         we can monitor the cloud's approach
                         and observe the tests from here.

                                   ben
                         is it safe?

                                   reed
                         the shields on the station should
                         protect us.

                                   ben
                         should?

                                   victor
                         what's wrong, ben?  eighty-million
                         dollars worth of equipment not enough
                         for you?

               ben turns to victor.  a little tension.  reed cuts it:

                                   reed
                         let's start loading those samples. 
                         get your suit ready, ben.

               victor keeps his eyes on ben.

                                   victor
                         so you still do all the heavy lifting?

               victor gives a friendly smile, patting reed.

                                   victor (cont'd)
                         maybe you should have stayed back in
                         the lab.  field work never suited you.

               reed doesn't defend himself.  ben steps up.

                                   ben
                         he does the talking.  i do the
                         walking.  got it?

               victor holds tight to his smile.  he nods, condescending.

                                   victor
                         got it.  so take a walk, ben...i'm
                         going to borrow susan for a second.

                                   reed
                         sure.

               ben and johnny read his eyes, as we cut to --
