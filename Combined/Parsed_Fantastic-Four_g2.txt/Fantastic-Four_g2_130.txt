               int. baxter building - ground floor - night

               ben pounds across the lobby.  he sees johnny coming in.

                                   johnny
                         christmas come early!  check it out!

               he holds up an action figure of ben: a horribly bloated body
               topped by a tiny pinhead.  johnny pushes a button and --

                                   ben action figure
                         it's clobberin' time!

               with one arm, ben shoves johnny into a wall.  with his other
               hand, ben grabs the toy and smashes it into the wall, inches
               from johnny's head.  the toy lodges into the plaster.

                                   johnny
                         hey!  that's a prototype!

                                   ben
                         go back to the drawing board.

               he strides away.
