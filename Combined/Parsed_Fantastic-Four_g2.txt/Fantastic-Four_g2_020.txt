               ben is carefully arranging sample boxes of plants.

                                   reed (on radio)
                         ben, we need you back inside.

               ben turns to see reed and johnny staring from a window.

                                   ben (into radio)
                         i ain't done arranging your flowers,
                         egghead.

                                   reed (on radio)
                         ben.  this is serious.  turn around.

               ben sees johnny motioning for ben to look behind him.  ben
               turns and sees: the cosmic storm, rumbling toward the
               station.  not close, but not far.  that gets ben's attention.

                                   ben (into radio)
                         roger that, on my way.

               he turns back towards the ship.  behind him, the storm grows.
