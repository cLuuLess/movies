               int. baxter building labs - day

               from their second level control room, reed and sue observe
               johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  flames escape
               through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!

               reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000
               degrees kelvin.  they are essentially taking his temperature. 

               inside the chamber: johnny turns white hot, blinding to look
               at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  machines go
               haywire.

               his feet even start to lift off the ground, levitating a foot
               or two.  he looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

                                   reed
                         back it down, johnny!

                                   johnny
                         i can go hotter!

               he won't stop.  reed pulls a switch on the wall.  foam sprays
               out of nozzles, dousing johnny's flames.  he stands there,
               covered in thick foam.  his body steams.  so does his temper.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         you're really cramping my style here.

                                   sue
                         you were at 4000 kelvin.  any hotter,
                         you're approaching supernova --

                                   johnny
                         sweet.

                                   sue
                         that's the temperature of the sun.

                                   reed
                         not only could you kill yourself, but
                         you could set fire to earth's
                         atmosphere and destroy all human life
                         as we know it.

                                   johnny
                         gotcha.  okay.  supernova bad.

               reed looks at the control panels.

                                   sue
                         he cooked the equipment.

               frustrated, reed looks at the smoking system.  and we cut to --
