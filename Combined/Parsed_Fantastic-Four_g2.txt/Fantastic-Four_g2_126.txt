               int. diner - later

               victor and ben sit in a window booth.  a waitress sets a
               foothigh stack of pancakes in front of ben, removes huge
               plates he's just cleared.  victor's aware of the other
               customers in the diner staring at ben.  ben burps: it rattles
               the plates.

                                   the thing
                         'scuse me.

                                   victor
                         i know it can't be easy.  life hasn't
                         changed that much for reed, sue and
                         johnny.  at least they can go out in
                         public.  but for you?  people staring.
                         whispering behind your back...

                                   the thing
                         if you're trying to cheer me up you're
                         doing a helluva job --

                                   victor
                         i'm just saying, i know what it's like
                         to lose something you love.  to see it
                         slip away, and know it's never coming
                         back.

               the thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.

                                   the thing
                         reed's gonna fix me up --

                                   victor
                         for your sake i hope you're right. 
                         i'm sorry if that sounds a little
                         skeptical.

                                   the thing
                         skeptical...?

               ben doesn't trust him.  but victor is hitting pressure
               points.

                                   victor
                         look, he's a brilliant man, we should
                         trust he's working as hard as he can. 
                         you're his best friend.  so what
                         possible reason could he have for
                         taking his time?
                             (a beat)
                         i mean, other than getting close to
                         sue?

               off the thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  he can't
               help but find truth in the words.  and we cut to --
