               whoosh!  a sculptor's hose sprays a thin stream of water at
               ben.  alicia cleans ben with her hands, using thin carving
               chisels for his cracks.  intricate, intimate work.

               ben enjoys every moment.  he eyes a couple, large puppets in
               the corner.

                                   ben
                         those yours too?

                         my step-dad's.  i'm strictly into
                         stone.  i was wondering when you'd
                         walk by.

                                   the thing
                         you know, you could'a run an ad in the
                         personals.

                                   alicia
                         "sensual blind chick seeks three-ton,
                         rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual
                         relationship."

                                   the thing
                         this ain't permanent.  my friend
                         reed's working on a cure...i think.

               she gets closer, running her hands across his arm.

                                   alicia
                         bennie.  you feel pretty good as is.

               ben bristles.  he doesn't want to stay this way.

                                   the thing
                         you don't know what it's like out
                         there.  walking around like some kind
                         of circus freak.  people staring,
                         whispering --

                                   alicia
                         i wouldn't know anything about that.

                                   the thing
                         i mean...

                                   alicia
                         tell me.  when you grew up in
                         brooklyn, how many astronauts did you
                         know?
                             (a beat)
                         you went your own way then.  you
                         didn't listen to people.  so why start
                         now...?

               as he ponders that, we hear a crowd swelling on the cut to --
