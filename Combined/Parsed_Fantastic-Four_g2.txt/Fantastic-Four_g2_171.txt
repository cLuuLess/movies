               int. circle line boat - banquet room - dusk

               reed and sue kiss on the deck of the circle line as it chugs
               around new york city.

                                   johnny (o.s.)
                         dude, that's still my sister.

               a party in progress.  drinks, food, music.  we see in the
               crowd a familiar faces: o'hoolihan (cast on his arm),
               bartender ernie, others.  johnny and ben stand behind reed
               and sue.

               reed and sue pull apart.  reed turns to ben, excited.

                                   reed
                         ben, i've been crunching the numbers
                         on the machine.  i think if we can
                         rework the power settings...

                                   ben
                         forget it, egghead.  i'm good as is.

                                   alicia (o.s.)
                         that's my benny.

               she hands ben a big metal mug.  ben takes the mug.  he
               clinks, but shatters her glass.

                                   alicia (cont'd)
                         we're going to have to work on your
                         touch.

                                   ben
                         i like the sound of that.

               alicia gets close.  a soft smile.  reed turns to sue.

                                   reed
                         sue, can i talk to you for a second?

               reed leads her out.  ben and johnny swap a glance.
