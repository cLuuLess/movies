               int. von doom compound - victor's office - early evening

               clunk.  the candles burn low on the table.  victor strides
               out, heading for the door.  he runs his hand through his hair
               to comb some strays.  a clump comes off in his fingers.  he
               pauses.  he steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  his scar. 

               it is longer than the bandage now (as if it spread).  victor
               peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray. 
               deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...
