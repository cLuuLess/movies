               ext. von doom compound - outside ben's room - early evening

               johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive
               bursts of flame.  he turns it on and off, like the "clapper."

                                   johnny
                         flame on, flame off.  flame on, flame
                         off --

                                   sue
                         johnny.

               he does it again.  flame on, flame off.

                                   sue (cont'd)
                         stop it.

                                   johnny
                         okay, "mom."

               reed's about to knock on ben's door when he hears the
               banging, moaning and pleading inside.  johnny smiles.

                                   johnny (cont'd)
                         oh, you dawg you.  better not be my
                         nurse!
