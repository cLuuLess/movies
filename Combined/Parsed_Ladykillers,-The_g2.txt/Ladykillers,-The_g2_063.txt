               the power-tool whine is louder here. we are looking at a 
               patch of wall.

               after a beat, and with a loud rev as resistance gives way, a 
               drill bit emerges from the wall, spitting out bits of the 
               masonry.

               the drill withdraws.

               after a beat, hammer blows.

               the chunk of masonry begins to buckle.
