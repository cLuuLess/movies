               ext. mississippi river - day

               a boat

               specifically, a garbage scow.

               we see it from on high, chugging down the placid but mighty 
               mississippi.

               head credits play over coverage of the garbage scow. no sound, 
               except for an incongruously heroic score.

               the coverage is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with 
               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film 
               rather than a feature.

               one piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is 
               obviously library. and not a new library either.

               the garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, 
               sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming 
               river island. disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise 
               from where they were picking through trash. their squawks, 
               like the boat horn, are not quite believable as sync.

               the head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.
