               int. munson house - staircase/living room - night

               --and he falls down the stairs, each thudding impact bouncing 
               his body like a rag doll's.

               at the bottom of the stairs he lies still.

               a close-up shows his head bent at an unnatural angle, 
               unblinking eyes staring. traces of smoke wisp from each 
               nostril and his open mouth.

               over the mantle, othar returns the dead man's stare. he looks 
               somewhat smug.
