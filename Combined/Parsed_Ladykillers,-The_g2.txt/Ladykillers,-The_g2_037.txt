               int. waffle house - day

               the band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of 
               coffee. dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality 
               of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string 
               tie. his manner is more mournful even than usual:

                                     dorr
                         oh my. oh my my my my my. this is a 
                         severe setback. i am distraught. i 
                         am more than distraught, i am 
                         devastated. oh my, this is quite the 
                         monkey-wrench heaved into the 
                         meticulously engineered construct of 
                         our little escapade.

                                     lump
                         yeah, it fucks things up.

                                     dorr
                         i am beside myself. i am at a positive 
                         loss for words.

                                     gawain
                         you still talkin' okay though.

                                     waitress
                         have you all decided?

               dorr's intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon 
               her:

                                     dorr
                         oh madam, we must have waffles. we 
                         must all have waffles forthwith!

               they hand in their menus.

                                     dorr
                         ...oh we must think. we must all 
                         have waffles and think, each and 
                         every one of us to the very best of 
                         his ability! perhaps if you apologized 
                         to the man and gave him flowers, or 
                         perhaps a fruit basket, with a card 
                         depicting a misty seascape and 
                         inscribed with a sentiment.

                                     gawain
                         shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'! 
                         he fired me 'cause i'm black!

                                     pancake
                         he can't do that. you could sue him. 
                         open and shut case.

                                     gawain
                         fuckin' a.

                                     pancake
                         this is not 1952.

                                     gawain
                         man's a fuckin' bigot.

                                     dorr
                         well then, perhaps, surely, a 
                         chocolate assortment has been known 
                         to warm the heart of even the most 
                         hardened misanthrope, especially if 
                         it's a premium chocolate, imported, 
                         say, from switzerland, or the 
                         netherlands, or some other of the so-
                         called "low" countries be they dutch 
                         or flemish or walloon--

                                     gawain
                         walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna 
                         roll over for a fuckin' candy bar!

                                     pancake
                         i'm afraid there's a setback on the 
                         tunneling front too. we've run into 
                         a pretty large rock, and--

                                     general
                         -- rock!

               all turn to look at the general. he continues to stare at a 
               spot in space. he slowly releases some inhaled cigarette 
               smoke, murmuring:

                                     general
                         ...very bad.

                                     dorr
                         oh my my, it seems that the poet was 
                         right: troubles never singly come.

                                     pancake
                         oh, we can get through the rock, no 
                         worries there. simplest thing in the 
                         world. why we blow right through it; 
                         i've got a pyro license, we bore a 
                         hole in the rock, pack in a little 
                         plastique; igneous blows pretty good, 
                         and we--

                                     lump
                         is he gonna want a piece of the 
                         action?

               all turn to look at lump.

                                     pancake
                         ...who?

               lump hesitates, looking at the inquiring faces that surround 
               him.

                                     lump
                         ...igneous?

               a female voice:

                                     mountain girl (o.s.)
                         hello clark. am i ordering the prima 
                         cord?

               the men look up at her.

                                     pancake
                         yes, mountain, we were just talking 
                         about that, and some plastique.

               all the men are staring at her, agog.

                                     gawain
                         ...the fuck is this?

                                     pancake
                         this is mountain girl. mountain is 
                         my right hand. she helps me with 
                         ordnance. helps me with damn near 
                         everything.

               the men stare.

                                     gawain
                         ...you brought your bitch to the 
                         waffle house?!

               there is tension in the air. dorr clears his throat.

                                     dorr
                         i confess myself to be puzzled as 
                         well. i thought we all understood 
                         that, so far as our little enterprise 
                         is concerned, mum, as the saying 
                         would have it, is the word--

                                     pancake
                         of course. i understand that. but 
                         this is mountain...

               he chuckles.

                                     pancake
                         ...i don't keep secrets from mountain. 
                         that's not how you maintain a loving, 
                         caring relationship.

                                     gawain
                         ...you brought your bitch to the 
                         waffle house?

               he looks around.

                                     gawain
                         ...man brings his bitch to the waffle 
                         house!

                                     pancake
                         look, you, i'll thank you to stop 
                         referring to mountain that way. she's 
                         the other half of my life.

                                     gawain
                         everybody lookin' at me like i'm a 
                         fuck-up, losin' that sorry-ass job, 
                         and this motherfucker bring his bitch 
                         to the waffle house!

               pancake lunges across the table, sending dishes clattering 
               to the floor as he grabs gawain by the shirt.

                                     pancake
                         you son of a bitch punk! shut your 
                         goddamn mouth!

               he shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at 
               him.

               gawain draws a gun.

                                     gawain
                         come and get me motherfuck! come on, 
                         baby, let's get it on!

               mountain starts screaming.

               people look, aghast.

                                     dorr
                         gentlemen, please!

               the other men pry pancake and gawain apart.

                                     dorr
                         ...gentlemen, this sort of behavior 
                         does you no credit in the eyes of 
                         your colleagues, or in those of the 
                         other patrons of this waffle house!

               pancake grumbles as he composes himself and straighten his 
               clothes.

                                     pancake
                         ...nobody talks to mountain girl 
                         that way. she had an abusive family!

                                     gawain
                         fuck you, man.

                                     pancake
                         little punk. i got syrup on my safari 
                         jacket.

               he embraces mountain, who continues to sob quietly.

                                     dorr
                         gentlemen, i propose that we consider 
                         the matter of this woman, mountain 
                         water, to be--

                                     pancake
                         mountain girl.

                                     dorr
                         i am so very sorry. i propose that 
                         we consider this matter to be closed, 
                         and we shall chose to trust her, 
                         since we now have no choice, and 
                         since she shall share only in mr. 
                         pancake's portion of the booty.

               over the shoulder of the quietly weeping mountain girl:

                                     pancake
                         of course. wouldn't have it any other 
                         way.

                                     gawain
                         damn right you won't.

                                     pancake
                         up yours, punk.

                                     dorr
                         gentlemen! and the manner of disposing 
                         of our igneous impediment is also 
                         settled. that leaves only the question 
                         of gawain retrieving his job.

                                     lump
                         couldn't you just bribe the guy?

               all turn to look at lump.
