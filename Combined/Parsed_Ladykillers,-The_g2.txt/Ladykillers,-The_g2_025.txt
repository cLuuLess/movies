               int. munson house - kitchen - day

               mrs. munson is at the kitchen table. she folds a five dollar 
               bill into a sheet of paper, raising her voice as she does 
               so:

                                     mrs. munson
                         it was a good sermon. that man has a 
                         lot to say.
