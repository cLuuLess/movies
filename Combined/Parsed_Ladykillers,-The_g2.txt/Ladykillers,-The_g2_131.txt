               int. saucier municipal building - day

               the sheriff is busy on the phone; there is a deputy today 
               also on the phone. the sheriff, seeing mrs. munson enter, 
               covers the phone with one hand.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         miz munson.

                                     mrs. munson
                         sheriff, i gotta make a statement.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         could it possibly wait, ma'am? we're 
                         a little busy today.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i guess it can wait, but it's about 
                         that casino money.

               the sheriff exchanges a significant look with the deputy, 
               then murmurs into the phone:

                                     sheriff wyner
                         call you right back.

               he cradles the phone and smiles at mrs. munson.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         ...you know something about it?

                                     mrs. munson
                         something? everything! i got it at 
                         home.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         you... you have what at home, now?

                                     mrs. munson
                         the money. two point six million 
                         dollars. down in my root cellar. all 
                         stacked up nice and neat.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         mm-hmm.

               the deputy pauses to look up from his phone:

                                     deputy
                         how'd it get there, marva?

                                     mrs. munson
                         bunch a desperate men that stole it 
                         put it there, that's how! they was 
                         musicians of the renaissance period, 
                         played the sackbutt and so on -- 
                         well, it turns out they really 
                         couldn't play, although they could 
                         recite poems to break your heart. 
                         their ringleader speaks in dead 
                         tongues.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         does he now.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i tried to get you to see him! that 
                         night?

                                     sheriff wyner
                         oh yes.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin' 
                         all that money and i guess i made 
                         'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked 
                         up and left without takin' the money. 
                         but i was peeved with 'em, sheriff, 
                         they'd been up to all sorts of 
                         mischief, come close to blowin' up 
                         the house, disturbed othar no end.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         angry, was he?

                                     mrs. munson
                         wouldn't you be? all that racket!

                                     sheriff wyner
                         i expect so.

                                     mrs. munson
                         and they let pickles out too!

               the sheriff sighs.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         so you want us to go fetch him.

                                     mrs. munson
                         no, he's back, but what you want me 
                         to do with the money?

                                     sheriff wyner
                         well...

               he and the deputy exchange looks. the sheriff looks back at 
               mrs. munson.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         ...why don't you just keep it, miz 
                         munson.

                                     mrs. munson
                         keep it?

                                     deputy
                         you keep it, marva.

                                     mrs. munson
                         well... i know it's only a penny 
                         offa everybody's policy...

                                     sheriff wyner
                         how's that ma'am?

                                     mrs. munson

                         i... you s'pose i could...

                                     sheriff wyner
                         yes ma'am?

                                     mrs. munson
                         could i give it all to bob jones 
                         university?

                                     sheriff wyner
                         that'd be nice, ma'am.

               she picks up her handbag and heads for the door.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...well, long as everybody knows.
