               ext. mississippi river - night

               we are at the mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue 
               to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted.

               the hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and 
               dimming its lights. the men emerge; when they open the back 
               of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to 
               watch from a distance.

               we watch the men from high, angled down along the masonry of 
               a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge. 
               an ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground.

               the garbage scow is approaching. we hear the low toot of its 
               horn as it nears the bridge.

               lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, 
               leaning over the railing.

               the nose of the barge enters below us.

               lump releases the sack.

               we watch it drop dead away like a bomb from an airplane.

               it thuds distantly onto the barge. the next sack has been 
               passed up to lump and is released.

               the cat watches. its orange eyes blink. its pupils adjust.
