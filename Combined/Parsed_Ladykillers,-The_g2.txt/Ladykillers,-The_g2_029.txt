               the men at work, tunneling.

               the cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the 
               hole now opened in the wall.

               lump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, 
               wields a pickaxe at the forward point.

               at the mouth of the hole clark pancake shovels dirt into a 
               heavy plastic refuse bag held open by gawain.

               g.h. dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to 
               the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses 
               perched midway down his nose.

               the general hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and 
               steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly 
               pressed leisure suit and ascot.
