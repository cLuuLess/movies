               int. church - day

               at the cut many voices are swelling in a song of worship. it 
               is a black baptist church, and the music has great energy.

               the white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the 
               podium.

                                     preacher
                         i know you all remember that when 
                         moses came down the mountain, carrying 
                         the word a god, come down that sinai 
                         peak, he caught those israelites red-
                         handed. what he catch 'em doin'? he 
                         caught 'em worshipping a golden calf.

               shouts of "that's right!"

                                     preacher
                         ...he caught 'em with their backs 
                         turned on god!

               more shouts of "that's right!"

                                     preacher
                         ...he caught 'em worshipping a false 
                         god! a god of earthly things! he 
                         caught them israelites in decline!

               "he caught 'em!"

                                     preacher
                         ...because backslidin' is decline, 
                         brothers and sisters! you hear talk 
                         these days, and i know you've heard 
                         this talk, you hear talk of decline, 
                         well all that means is we done turned 
                         our back on god!

               "that's right!"

                                     preacher
                         ...people say civilization doin' 
                         this, civilization doin' that, 
                         civilization in decline! well it 
                         ain't no civilization! it ain't no 
                         them! it's us, brothers and sisters!

               "amen!"

               we are tracking among the congregants, disproportionately 
               women, mostly of middle age and elderly, mostly wearing 
               elaborate go-to-church hats.

                                     preacher
                         ...it's what's in our hearts, each 
                         and every one of us when we like 
                         them israelites! slidin' awa-a-a-ay 
                         down that godly slope, slippin' and 
                         slidin' toward the mire and muck a 
                         the stinkhole of greed -- that's 
                         decline!

               "that's decline!"

               the continuing track brings us onto mrs. munson, wearing, 
               like most of her peers, an oversized hat; hers is adorned 
               with a great deal of plastic fruit.

                                     preacher
                         ...and what did moses do when he saw 
                         those declinin' backslidin' never-
                         mindin' sinners?

               "what he do?"

                                     preacher
                         ...moses smote those sinners in his 
                         wrath yes he did!

               "yes he did!"

                                     preacher
                         ...y'all know what smote is! i smite! 
                         you smite! he smites! we done smote!

               "that's right!"

                                     preacher
                         ...to smite is to go upside the head!

               "uh-huh!"

                                     preacher
                         ...because sometimes, brothers and 
                         sisters, that is the only way!

               "yes it is!"

                                     preacher
                         ...to smite is to remind! we got to 
                         stop that decline! and scramble back 
                         up to the face a the almighty gyod!

               "amen!"

                                     preacher
                         ...'stead a worshippin' that golden 
                         calf, that earthly trash on that

                         in that shadowland way outside the

               "way outside!"

                                     preacher
                         ...that garbage island where scavenger 
                         birds feast on the bones a the

               "yes they do!"

                                     preacher
                         ...and so, let us pray...
