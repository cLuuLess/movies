               int. munson house - kitchen - night

               dorr enters breezily; mrs. munson is at the sink, filling a 
               teapot.

               dorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, mrs. munson 
               has her back to the living room.

                                     dorr
                         well, my dear mrs. munson, i have 
                         outlined your position to my 
                         colleagues and i now return to you 
                         to return our collective verdict.

                                     mrs. munson
                         mm-hmm.

               behind her, the general peers around the corner and starts a 
               catlike advance across the living room.

                                     dorr
                         there was much spirited discussion 
                         and an atmosphere of frank give-and-
                         take. some of our number were 
                         initially appalled at your proposal 
                         that we simply return the money; 
                         some were more receptive.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i don't care they was receptive or 
                         not!

                                     dorr
                         and that attitude, madam, was a factor 
                         in our discussions. to a man, i must 
                         say, they were devastated at the 
                         prospect of not being able to 
                         contribute to their respective 
                         charities.

               the general signals to lump who now crosses the living room 
               with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's 
               carry.

                                     mrs. munson
                         well that is a shame.

                                     dorr
                         indeed. but at the end of the day, 
                         your position prevailed, and the men 
                         have decided that we shall return 
                         the money -- every last cent of it! -- 
                         and attend sunday services, rather 
                         than spend the remainder of our years 
                         wasting away in the mississippi men's 
                         correctional facility. though that 
                         was the original preference of some.

                                     mrs. munson
                         well i'm glad y'all came to see the 
                         light, anyway. i'm gonna have some 
                         tea and go to bed.

               the professor, seeing that the general and lump have made it 
               out the door, is anxious to wind things up:

                                     dorr
                         so the money shall be returned 
                         tomorrow at the opening of the casino 
                         office. enjoy your tea, madam...

               backing out, he looks to one side.

               through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling 
               away from the curb. there is another car -- an old volkswagon 
               microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street.

               dorr looks back to mrs. munson.

                                     dorr
                         ...and congratulations on having 
                         recalled to the fold five poor, 
                         confused sheep who had momentarily 
                         strayed.
