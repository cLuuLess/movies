               int. munson house - living room - day

               the cellar door opens and the men troop out, g.h. dorr leading 
               and the other men following rather sheepishly behind.

                                     dorr
                         madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you 
                         will have to accept our apologies 
                         for failing to perform since, as you 
                         see, we are shorthanded. gawain is 
                         still at work and we could no more 
                         play with one part tacit than a horse 
                         could canter shy one leg.

                                     ladies
                         mm-hmm.

                                     mrs. munson
                         hmph.

                                     dorr
                         perhaps i could offer as a poor but 
                         ready substitute a brief poetic 
                         recital. though i don't pretend to 
                         great oratorical skills, i will 
                         happily present, with your ladies' 
                         permission, verse from the unquiet 
                         mind of mr. ed g'allan poe.

               lump, pancake, and the general sit and awkwardly accept dainty 
               teacups.

               the professor rises, spreads his hand, and pronounces:

                                     dorr
                         ..."ladies, thy beauty is to me like 
                         those nicean barks of yore..."

               close-ups of the various ladies, some sipping tea or slowly 
               munching biscuits, but all eyes glued to the declaiming man 
               in the cape.

                                     dorr
                         "that gently, o'er a perfumed sea 
                         the weary, wayworn wanderer bore to 
                         his own native shore... "

               murmuring voice:

                                     voice
                         amen.

               a slurp of tea from another quarter.

               dorr bears on:

                                     dorr
                         "on desperate seas long wont to roam, 
                         thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, 
                         thy naiad airs have brought me home 
                         to the glory that was greece and the 
                         grandeur that was rome... "

               a long silence.

               then, scattered:

                                     voices
                         mm-mm. glory hallelujah.

               a lady holding a teacup turns to the general:

                                     lady
                         that was soooome poem.

               the general stares at her.

                                     lady
                         ...you know any?

               we hear the front door opening and gawain enters, still 
               wearing his lady luck custodial uniform. he looks.

               his pov: church ladies with teacups and his comrades seated 
               among them, also holding teacups and scones.

                                     gawain
                         y'all been celebratin'?.
