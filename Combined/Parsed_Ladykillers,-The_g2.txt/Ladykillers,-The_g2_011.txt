                         you see, madam, i am currently on 
                         sabbatical from the institution where 
                         i teach -- the university of 
                         mississippi at hattiesburg. i am 
                         taking a year off to indulge my 
                         passion -- i don't believe that is 
                         too strong a word -- for the music 
                         of the renaissance. i perform in -- 
                         and have the honor of directing -- a 
                         period instrument ensemble that 
                         performs at renaissance fairs and 
                         other cultural fora...
