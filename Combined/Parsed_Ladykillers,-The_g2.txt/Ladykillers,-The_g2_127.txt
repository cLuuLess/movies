               int. munson house - mrs. munson's bedroom - day

               drinking glass

               it is resting on the very edge of the night table -- 
               protruding, in fact, past the table's edge.

               it is morning. we hear rustling from the bed.

               hands reach into frame and hesitate, finding the glass empty 
               of water and precariously perched.

                                     mrs. munson (o.s.)
                         hmm.

               the hands tip the glass and take the teeth. we hear 
               complicated oral noises.
