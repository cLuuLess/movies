               int. munson - living room - night

               in the foreground mrs. munson sits knitting, humming an old 
               temperance tune. in the background the cellar door swings 
               open. marva munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles 
               continue their rhythmic clack.

               we pull gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious 
               steps across the floor.

               we intercut his pov of the back of the old lady's head, bowed 
               over her knitting.

               as gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries 
               in it his hand holding the gun.

               he looks back up at the old lady. but now, still cautiously 
               approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.

               his pov

               nearing the old lady is now different somehow. the perspective 
               is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the 
               same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly 
               different.

               when we cut back to gawain

               he is a runty, ten-year-old child walking slowly across the 
               floor; he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming 
               little puppy dog.

               the dog yips; the woman turns to look at us. it is not mrs. 
               munson, but another black woman of about the same age.

                                     mama
                         what you got there, gawain?

                                     child gawain
                         why -- nothin', mama.

                                     mama
                         nothin' my ass! you got a dog there!

                                     child gawain
                         no, mama!

                                     mama
                         a filthy noisy little pest of a puppy 
                         dog gonna shit all over the house!

                                     child gawain
                         he won't shit in the house, mama, 
                         i'm gonna train him, i promise, gonna 
                         train him real good--

               whap! she cuffs him on the side of his head.

                                     mama
                         i'm gonna train you real good! i 
                         told you don't bring no stray dogs 
                         into this house!

               whap! another slap.

                                     mama
                         ...you wait til your daddy gets home, 
                         he gonna lay into you proper!

               whap!

               the little boy, weeping, throws his arms around his mother:

                                     child gawain
                         please don't hurt me no more! i love 
                         you, mama!

                                     mama
                         daddy gonna kick your ass!

               whap!

                                     mama
                         ...bringin' in a filthy dirty dog!

               whap! gawain's little brothers and sisters, drawn by the 
               commotion, have gathered excitedly to watch.

                                     sister
                         mama's whuppin' gawain's ass!

                                     brother
                              (eagerly)
                         ain't you gonna use the strap, mama?

               whap! whap! gawain is sobbing:

                                     child gawain
                         please don't hurt me, mama!

               now it is the adult gawain blubbering.

               the clack of knitting needles stops and mrs. munson turns to 
               look.

                                     mrs. munson
                         what you doin'? what you doin' with 
                         my pillow there?

               he surreptitiously slides the gun into his pocket, sniveling:

                                     gawain
                         i'm sorry, ma'am, i--

               whap! she cuffs him on the side of the head.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i'm displeased with you! colored boy 
                         like you, falling in with that trash 
                         downstairs!

               whap!

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...ashamed a yourself! didn't your 
                         mama raise you right!
