               int. munson house - cellar - night

               gawain is tramping down the stairs.

                                     gawain
                         i can't do it!

               the men are stunned.

                                     dorr
                         why... this is most... irregular.

                                     gawain
                         she reminds me of my mama. i can't 
                         shoot my mama! you motherfuckers 
                         just draw straws again.

                                     pancake
                         wait a minute. you've got to accept 
                         your responsibilities, young man.

                                     gawain
                         fuck you. and your irritated bowel. 
                         i can't shoot that old lady.

                                     general
                         must shoot!

                                     pancake
                         now look here, it's the easiest thing 
                         in the world. pretend her head is a 
                         casaba melon, and the gun is a melon-
                         baller, and--

                                     gawain
                         what the fuck you talkin' about, 
                         man? you think this a melon-baller, 
                         you do it, man!

                                     dorr
                         my my, this is most irregular.

                                     pancake
                         look, with equal rights come equal 
                         responsibilities--

                                     dorr
                         i'm afraid that mr. pancake is right, 
                         my dear fellow. we cannot draw straws 
                         again; the exercise loses all 
                         credibility if you show that the 
                         loser can simply beg off doing the 
                         job.

                                     general
                         must shoot!

               gawain shoves the gun toward pancake.

                                     gawain
                         she just an old colored lady to you -- 
                         you do it, man!

                                     pancake
                         why you sniveling little coward!

                                     gawain
                         what you say, you whiney motherfucker? 
                         i come up your irritated ass with 
                         this -- motherfuckin' gun--

               he is waving the gun.

                                     pancake
                         you think you scare me, you mewling 
                         punk! you don't scare me! bull connor 
                         and all his dogs didn't scare me!

               he shoves gawain.

                                     pancake
                         ...be a man!

                                     gawain
                         you fuck!

               he shoves him back.

               pancake shoves:

                                     pancake
                         be a man!

                                     gawain
                         you ain't no fuckin' man, fuckin' a 
                         sixty-year-old lady in pigtails!

                                     pancake
                         why you bastard punk! mountain girl 
                         is fifty-three!

               they are shoving each other now, getting into it.

                                     pancake
                         ...she could ride your ass to jelly!

               he lunges at him with a bear hug and his inertia sends both 
               men tumbling to the floor, where they roll and wrestle.

                                     dorr
                         gentlemen, please!

                                     gawain
                         i seen virginia hams i'd rather stick 
                         my dick in than your old--

               bang! a muffled gunshot.

               quiet.

               the two men have stopped rolling.

               they stare at each other where they lie, pancake on top.

               at length:

                                     pancake
                         ...oh my god...

               horrified, he slowly rises.

                                     pancake
                         ...i think he's hit!

               the men gather round and look down.

               gawain still stares up at the ceiling.

               pancake stoops, waves his hand in front of his eyes. no 
               reaction.

                                     pancake
                         ...i'll just check the carotid artery.

               he checks the carotid artery.

                                     pancake
                         ...that's a negative.

                                     lump
                         oh, fuck.

                                     dorr
                         oh my.

                                     lump
                         is he dead, professor?

                                     pancake
                         sure he's dead. i checked his carotid 
                         artery.

                                     dorr
                         well this is most irregular. we will 
                         need a hefty bag.
