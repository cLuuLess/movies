               int. munson house - cellar - night

               dorr ducks while descending the steep, narrow stair in order 
               to avoid an overhead beam. he is followed by mrs. munson.

                                     dorr
                         yes, yes, yes, this looks promising...

               he pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead.

                                     mrs. munson
                         little dank, ain't it?

                                     dorr
                         oh, indeed, but that only improves 
                         the acoustics...

               he experimentally claps his hands.

                                     dorr
                         ...marvelous. these earthen walls 
                         are ideal for baffling the higher 
                         registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, 
                         sackbutt. that's why so much music 
                         of the cinquecento was played in 
                         crypts and catacombs. yes, this will 
                         do nicely...

               he dry-washes his hands with enthusiasm, but his tone remains 
               mournful.

                                     dorr
                         ...this is perfect. this is more 
                         than perfect. i can scarcely contain 
                         my glee.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you containing it okay.

               he starts to peel cash out of a large, well-worn billfold:

                                     dorr
                         allow me to pay you a week in advance. 
                         allow me to pay you two weeks in 
                         advance. allow me to pay you a month 
                         in advance. i cannot countenance the 
                         thought of these charming apartments 
                         being tenanted by someone 
                         unappreciative of their special je 
                         ne sais quoi.

                                     mrs. munson
                         that would be a shame.
