               we are close on gawain peering anxiously to one side.

               he turns and peers the other way.

               we hear a toilet flush and, after a beat, clark emerges from 
               the men's room door next to which gawain stands. his manner 
               is now completely relaxed.

                         feel thirty pounds lighter.

               they start walking back to the vault.

                         ...thank you for being so 
                         understanding. not everyone is, of 
                         course, which is why the biggest 
                         challenge of ibs is educating the 
                         public. afflicts over two million 
                         people yet most of us have never 
                         heard of it. and it strikes without 
                         regard to age, gender or race.

                                     gawain
                         oh fuck, man, i don't wanna know 
                         about it.

                                     pancake
                         that's the kind of attitude we're 
                         fighting.

                                     gawain
                         well maybe you should sign me up, 
                         man, 'cause you startin' to irritate 
                         my bowel.
