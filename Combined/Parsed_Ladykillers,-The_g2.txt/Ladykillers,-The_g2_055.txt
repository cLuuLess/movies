               ext. munson house - night

               the two women looking.

               the front door of the house opens. lump, the professor, and 
               gawain emerge, escorting pancake. just before gawain finishes 
               closing the door the cat slips out.

                                     mrs. munson
                         pickles!

               the door is yanked fully open and the general races out after 
               the cat.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...you catch pickles now!

               the cat races across the lawn and, with no break in stride, 
               up his favorite tree.

               the general follows and, also without breaking stride, 
               clambers up the tree after it.

               tree limbs shake with activity hidden by the leaves. we hear 
               the hiss of the cat.

               the men are bundling pancake into the hearse. dorr calls to 
               the women before climbing in:

                                     dorr
                         the house is perfectly in order, but 
                         we need medical attention for mr. 
                         pancake who, during the disturbance, 
                         pinched his finger in a valve of the 
                         sackbutt.

               the cat leaps out of the tree and runs away down the road.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you let the cat out!

               the general leaps out of the tree to land catlike on the 
               street, arms tensed, casts a look both ways, and then pursues 
               the animal down the road. we hear the retreating padding 
               footsteps of all six feet.

                                     dorr
                         the general is even now exercising 
                         every effort to retrieve your 
                         mischievous little pet. please go, 
                         go and enjoy your concert, and we 
                         shall see you later in the evening. 
                         au revoir, mes dames!
