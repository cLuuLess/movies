               int. munson house - cellar - night

               we hear the whine of the drill faintly here, all but covered 
               by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box.

               the other men sit around. dorr gives a casual glance at his 
               watch as the whine subsides.

               pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime.

                                     pancake
                         the drill bit's getting awfully hot. 
                         gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson 
                         sprayer and spritz it down while i 
                         drill.

                                     gawain
                         fuck you, man, i ain't your house 
                         nigger. i'm the inside man!

                                     pancake
                         look, are you gonna have a bug up 
                         your ass for the rest of the time we 
                         work together?

                                     lump
                         i'll get the sprayer.

                                     pancake
                         no no, me and this gentleman here 
                         have to get square. let me tell you 
                         something, macsam. you wanna know 
                         something?

                                     gawain
                         i don't wanna know shit from you.

               pancake leans against the wall and pushes his goggles up on 
               his forehead, leaving raccoon eyes.

                                     pancake
                         i'm gonna tell you how i came down 
                         to mississippi. wasn't born here, 
                         you know. i'm from scranton, 
                         pennsylvania...

               abruptly, he stares off into space.

                                     pancake
                         ...nnnff!

                                     gawain
                         huh?

               pancake's eyes regain their focus:

                                     pancake
                         ...scranton, pennsylvania. came down 
                         here in 1964. greyhound bus. with 
                         the freedom riders. you know who the 
                         freedom riders were, macsam?

                                     gawain
                         i don't give a shit who they were. 
                         just tell me when they gonna leave.

                                     pancake
                         the freedom riders, my fine young 
                         man, were a group of concerned 
                         liberals from up north -- whites, 
                         negros, and yes, jewish people -- 
                         all working together, just like we 
                         are here. concerned citizens who 
                         came down here so that local black 
                         people could have their civil 
                         liberties. so that people like you 
                         could have the vote.

               all look at pancake. quiet, except for the delicate chamber 
               music.

               gawain's tone softens:

                                     gawain
                         ...you know what, man?

                                     pancake
                         what, brother?

                                     gawain
                         i don't vote. so fuck you.

               pancake darkens:

                                     pancake
                         why you fucking--

                                     gawain
                         and the bus you rode in on!

                                     pancake
                         that's it!

               he peels off his coat.

                                     pancake
                         ...let's step outside, macsam!

               there is a knock on the cellar door. the men freeze 
               momentarily, then scramble for their instruments. the general 
               flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth.

               dorr turns off the boom box, then calls:

                                     dorr
                         yes, madam?

               the door opens and mrs. munson comes down the stairs, holding 
               a large plate covered by a checked napkin.

                                     mrs. munson
                         my friend mrs. funthes is here so 
                         i'm about to go on out. i just wanted 
                         to leave y'all with some cinnamon 
                         cookies...

               she takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person 
               to person; each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured 
               "thank you, ma'am."

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...y'all sound pretty good. it'd be 
                         nice if you'd come by the church 
                         some day, give us a recital.

               dorr takes her by the arm and escorts her back to the stairs.

                                     dorr
                         oh madam, you are too kind. our music, 
                         however, is -- how shall i put it? -- 
                         rather roman in its outlook; many of 
                         our pieces were commissioned by the 
                         holy see.

                                     mrs. munson
                         oh, i see all right, but we don't 
                         make a big whoop-dee-do about 
                         denominations; everybody welcome at 
                         our church. we've had methodists 
                         come in. episcopals. even had a jew 
                         come in once with a guitar back in 
                         the sixties.

                                     dorr
                         indeed. excuse me, one moment, ma'am, 
                         and i shall see you off...

               they have reached the top of the stairs and the professor 
               ushers her out but stays behind himself. he turns to address 
               the rest of the men below:

                                     dorr
                         ...if you gentlemen can labor 
                         harmoniously in the course of my 
                         absence, then perhaps upon my return 
                         we shall be prepared to explode that 
                         vexin' ol' piece a igneous.

                                     gawain
                         he's the motherfuckin' piece of 
                         igneous.
