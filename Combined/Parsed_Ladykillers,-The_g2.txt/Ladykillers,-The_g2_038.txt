               int. munson living room - night

               othar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece. 
               marva munson knits; g.h. dorr sits nodding over an ancient 
               volume of half-forgotten lore, reading glasses perched midway 
               down his nose. curtains waft lazily in the summer night 
               breeze.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...you just a readin' fool, ain't 
                         you mr. dorr.

                                     dorr
                         yes yes, i must confess, madam, that 
                         often i feel more at home in these 
                         ancient volumes than i do in the 
                         hustle-bustle of our modern world. 
                         to me, paradoxically, the literature 
                         of the so-called "dead tongues" has 
                         more currency than this mornin's 
                         newspaper.

                                     mrs. munson
                         mm-mm.

                                     dorr
                         in these books...

               he removes his glasses and lazily twirls them.

                                     dorr
                         ...in these volumes, there is the 
                         accum'lated wisdom a mankind which 
                         succours me when the day is hard or 
                         the night lonely and long.

                                     mrs. munson
                         wisdom of mankind, what about the 
                         wisdom of the lord?

                                     dorr
                         oh yes, the good book, mm. i have 
                         found reward in its pages. but for 
                         me there are other good books as 
                         well; the heavy volumes of antiquity, 
                         freighted with the insights of man's 
                         glorious age. and then of course i 
                         love, love, love the works of mr. ed 
                         g'allan poe.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i know who he is. kinda creepy.

                                     dorr
                         oh no, madam, noooo. not of this 
                         world, true; he lived in a dream, an 
                         ancient dream...

               dorr himself is lost in a dream:

                                     dorr
                         "helen, they beauty is to me like 
                         those nicean barks a yore that gently, 
                         o'er a perfumed sea, the weary, 
                         wayworn wanderer bore to his own 
                         native shore... "

                                     mrs. munson
                         who was helen? she wasn't a loose 
                         woman, was she? some kinda whore a 
                         babylon?

               dorr is still lost:

                                     dorr
                         one doesn't know who helen was, though 
                         i picture her as bein' very, very 
                         extremely... pale.

               he comes to himself, focuses on mrs. munson.

                                     dorr
                         ...miz munson, i was tryin' to think 
                         of some way of expressin' my gratitude 
                         to you for takin' in...

               he chuckles.

                                     dorr
                         ...this weary, wayworn wanderer...

               the professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it 
               had served as bookmark, and hands it across.

                                     dorr
                         ...it's just a modest little ol' 
                         present, why it's practically nothing 
                         at all.

               beaming, she takes two tickets out of the envelope and 
               inspects them.

                                     mrs. munson
                         oh mr. dorr, why you are such a 
                         gallant man...

                                     dorr
                         oh no madam, i blush. i melt. no, i 
                         just happened to hear of this gospel 
                         concert tomorrow night, the mighty 
                         mighty clouds of joy, and i thought 
                         you and a friend from church, 
                         perhaps...

                                     mrs. munson
                         othar loved that music... yes, i got 
                         a widow-lady friend...

                                     dorr
                         the concert is up in memphis, but i 
                         have arranged for a car service to 
                         transport you thither and, needless 
                         to say, back home at the concert's 
                         termination. my friends and i will 
                         be rehearsing here tomorrow evening 
                         so you needn't worry about the 
                         security of your charming little old 
                         house...

               there is a knock at the door.

                                     mrs. munson
                         huh? excuse me.

               i/e. munson house - foyer - night

               mrs. munson swings the door open to sheriff wyner. his squad 
               car is parked at the curb.

                                     mrs. munson
                         sheriff wyner, how you doin'...
