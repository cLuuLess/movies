               ext. mississippi river - bridge - night

               we are at the middle of the bridge, the tower gargoyle looking 
               blankly down at the doings below.

               in the misty night lump and the general are braced over the 
               railing, looking down, each holding one of the feet that 
               protrude from the hefty bag cinched around gawain's ankles. 
               a cigarette burns on the general's lower lip. behind the two 
               men we can see the idling hearse.

               there is the toot of the garbage scow. lump and the general 
               release gawain's feet.

               their pov shows the sack receding and flumping into the 
               garbage piled onto the scow that slips by below.

               a flock of scavenger birds, disturbed by the impact, lifts 
               off the scow with angry caws.
