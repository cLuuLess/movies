               ext. mississippi river - bridge - night

               the tower gargoyle stares sightlessly down.

               lump and the general are at their accustomed place, each 
               holding a foot shod in a large hiking boot.

               behind them we see the hearse idling.

               near them on the bridge, both hands grasping the railing as 
               he gazes dreamily out into the night, is the professor.

                                     dorr
                         "...like those nicean barks of yore 
                         that gently, o'er a perfumed sea..."

               we hear the toot of the boat's horn and the men drop the 
               body.

                                     lump
                         quick! grab clark!

               they quickly stoop and grab another bag-swaddled body out of 
               which even larger hiking boots protrude.

                                     dorr
                         "...the weary, wayworn wanderer 
                         bore... "

               they drop the second body.

                                     dorr
                         "...to his own native shore."

               we hear the distant flump and the cawing of scavenger birds.
