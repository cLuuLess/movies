               int. munson house - living room - night

               othar's portrait, upside-down, seems to be looking bemusedly 
               down on us.

               an objective angle shows dorr lying on the couch, a damp 
               washcloth on his forehead, eyes rolled back to look at the 
               picture.

               mrs. munson is entering with a cup of tea. dorr swings his 
               feet out to sit up and accept the tea.

                                     dorr
                         i thank you, madam, for your act of 
                         kindness.

                                     mrs. munson
                         well you let him out.

                                     dorr
                         i certainly did and i do apologize 
                         no end. allow me to present myself, 
                         uh, formally: goldthwait higginson 
                         dorr, ph.d.

                                     mrs. munson
                         what, like elmer?

                                     dorr
                         beg your pardon, ma'am?

                                     mrs. munson
                         fudd?

                                     dorr
                         no no, ph.d. is a mark of academic 
                         attainment. it is a degree of higher 
                         learning bestowed, in my case, in 
                         recognition of my mastery of the 
                         antique languages of latin and greek. 
                         i also hold a number of other advanced 
                         degrees including the baccalaureate 
                         from a school in paris, france, called 
                         the sorbonne.

               munson chuckles.

                                     mrs. munson
                         sore bone, well i guess that's 
                         appropriate. you ever study at bob 
                         jones university?

                                     dorr
                         i have not had that privilege.

                                     mrs. munson
                         it's a bible school, only the finest 
                         in the country. i send them five 
                         dollars every month.

                                     dorr
                         that's very gener--

                                     mrs. munson
                         i'm on their mailing list. i'm an 
                         angel.

                                     dorr
                         indeed.

                                     mrs. munson
                         they list my name in the newsletter, 
                         every issue. i got the literature 
                         here, you wanna examine it.

                                     dorr
                         perhaps when my head has recovered 
                         from its... buffeting. mrs. munson, 
                         are you at all curious as to why i 
                         darkened your door, as the expression 
                         has it, on this lovely camelia-scented 
                         morn?

                                     mrs. munson
                         i was wondering, til you let pickles 
                         out. then in all the excitement--

                                     dorr
                         i quite understand. the fact is that 
                         i saw the sign on your window 
                         advertising a room to let, and it is 
                         the only such sign among the houses 
                         of this charming, charming street.

                                     mrs. munson
                         yeah, i got a room. i'm lookin' for 
                         a quiet tenant. fifteen dollars a 
                         week

                                     dorr
                         i quite understand. madam, you are 
                         addressing a man who is quiet -- and 
                         yet not quiet, if i may offer a 
                         riddle...

               he sets down the teacup and rises.

                                     dorr
                         ...perhaps you can show me the room, 
                         mrs. munson, and allow me to explain.

                                     mrs. munson
                         well you can see the room, but i 
                         don't like double-talk.

               mrs. munson precedes him...
