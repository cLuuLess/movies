               int. munson house - kitchen - day

               mrs. munson hand-cranks a can opener around a tin of cat 
               food.

                                     mrs. munson
                         mm... gizzards...

               the cat paces back and forth between her legs, leaning into 
               them and purring, responding to the snap of tin as the cover 
               comes off the can.

               the can contains cubed processed gizzard in a gelatinous 
               medium like the stuff that clings to gefilte fish.
