                         ...we academics are inordinately 
                         fond of wedgin' ourselves into 
                         confined spaces. at yale the students 
                         will see how many of their number 
                         they can enclose in a telephone booth;

                         craze, of course, a different but 
                         related phenomenon... ahem... i hope 
                         i didn't spill any tea...
