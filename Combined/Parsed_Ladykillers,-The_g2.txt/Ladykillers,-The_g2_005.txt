               ext. munson house - day

               with a neatly tended garden. it is the last house on a street 
               of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond 
               it the street disappears down a bluff. the empty space beyond 
               suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an 
               anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise. 
               the paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of 
               the river.

               mrs. munson is entering by the gate. she stops in the garden 
               and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect 
               row of flowers.

               mrs. munson lets herself in. a cat lopes up to her, the bell 
               around its neck tinkling, and leans mewing into her leg.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you need somethin' to eat, angel?
