               ext. saucier, mississippi - day

               an old hound dog

               lies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front 
               porch. the porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. it is 
               quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very 
               distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in 
               a baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze 
               fan them in and out of audibility.

               we once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now 
               and played as real, not slapdash effect. at this, the dog 
               lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, 
               lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his 
               forepaws. he huffs briefly and goes to sleep.

               we drift up to show that the dog is sleeping before the

               saucier worm store

               your source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera...

               we travel over to reveal that the modest one-story structure 
               houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the

               saucier municipal building.

               a campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a 
               black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a 
               thumbs-up:

               re-elect wayne wyner sheriff/he is too old to go to work.
