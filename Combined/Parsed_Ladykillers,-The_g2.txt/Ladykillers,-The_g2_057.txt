               int. munson house - cellar - night

               close on schematic map

               it shows the underground complex and, stretching towards it 
               in a line drawn with a blunt pencil, is the tunnel. it is 
               now almost to the vault.

               a violin bow enters to tap at the line.

                                     dorr (o.s.)
                         despite our little setback we find 
                         ourselves on schedule to penetrate 
                         the vault...

               the bow taps at the vault outline.

                                     dorr
                         ...here, this afternoon, having 
                         successfully blasted that little ol' 
                         rock to pieces during miz munson's 
                         choir practice.

               the violin bow withdraws.

                                     dorr
                         ...clark, perhaps you can run us 
                         through the game plan for what remains 
                         of our tunnelin'.

               a bandaged hand enters frame and a finger-stump points at 
               the end of the penciled line.

                                     pancake (o.s.)
                         of course. why, it's child's play 
                         now, easiest thing in the world. 
                         only a couple of feet separate us 
                         from the vault...

               wider

               the men are clustered around the map, spread out on the 
               sackbutt case in the cellar. clark continues:

                                     pancake
                         ...just the usual spadework until we 
                         hit the masonry of the vault, and 
                         then we drill through.

                                     dorr
                         and will you be able to wield the 
                         drill with your maimed extremity?

                                     pancake
                         oh, i should think so, it's only one 
                         finger. inhibits me in doing finer 
                         work, of course. i'll always have to 
                         live with that... ahem. maybe, and 
                         i'm just thinking out loud here, 
                         maybe since, as you say, it will 
                         present problems later...

                                     dorr
                         yes, clark?

                                     pancake
                         well, maybe -- and this is something 
                         i've talked over with mountain girl, 
                         and she agrees with me, so it's not 
                         just one person's opinion -- maybe i 
                         should get a little extra compensation 
                         for the accident.

               a long, stony silence.

                                     pancake
                         ...somewhat larger share. why, if 
                         this were any other line of work i'd 
                         be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't 
                         i? might even have a pretty good 
                         lawsuit.

                                     gawain
                         you gonna sue yaself for blowin' off 
                         your finger?

                                     pancake
                         well that is simply asinine--

                                     dorr
                         yes but you see, clark, this is not 
                         what you just called "some other 
                         line of work."

                                     pancake
                         but if it were--

                                     dorr
                         this is a criminal enterprise, not 
                         to put too fine a point on it, 
                         entailin' all manner a risks not 
                         involved in honest labor. governmental 
                         regulations an' civic safeguards 
                         cannot be assumed to apply to 
                         antisocial pursuits.

                                     lump
                         yeah, but he lost his finger.

                                     gawain
                         we don't give a shit! man can blow 
                         his own dick off, don't make no 
                         nevermind to us! we don't gotta pay 
                         the man for goin' around blowin' off 
                         body parts! getcha head outcha ass, 
                         man!

                                     pancake
                         look, you--

                                     dorr
                         i think that in this instance gawain 
                         has a very excellent point. i--

                                     general
                         no extra share!

               all stop and stare at the general.

               clark grumbles:

                                     pancake
                         well, okay, majority rules, like i 
                         say, it was just a trial balloon. 
                         hand's not so bad really, i even get 
                         some phantom feeling.

                                     gawain
                         you pull on your prick you get phantom 
                         feeling. greedy motherfuck.

                                     dorr
                         now that that matter is settled, let 
                         us synchronize our watches before 
                         gawain reports to work. in... twenty 
                         seconds... it will be twelve-sixteen 
                         exactly... fifteen...

                                     pancake
                         it will be twelve-fifteen?

                                     dorr
                         no, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven 
                         seconds -- it will be twelve-
                         sixteen... eight...

                                     lump
                         professor?

                                     dorr
                         six... five -- yes, lump?

                                     lump
                         i don't have a watch.
