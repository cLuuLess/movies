               ext. football field - day

               pov

               we are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear 
               the super-present breathing of the helmet's occupant. just 
               over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a 
               snap count.

               we are in a crouch position looking downfield. at the call 
               of "hike!" we and everyone on the field spring into action.

               we sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder. a 
               very big person downfield is sprinting toward us.

               after several yards, still on the move, we pan quickly around 
               to look back for the quarterback. barely visible among 
               converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone 
               else.

               easing up on the run we pan back around to look downfield 
               just as the oncoming defender is upon us and -- crunch -- 
               slams into us. a strobing pan leaves us looking up at the 
               sky. our loud breathing has stopped.

               after a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored 
               inhale. it continues irregularly. another helmeted player 
               appears above us to peer down into our helmet. he extends a 
               hand to help us up.

               huddle

               we are looking back and forth around the circle at our 
               gathered teammates.

                                     quarterback
                         delta thirty-seven. on four!

               all, with a simultaneous hand clap:

                                     team
                         huh!

               line of scrimmage

               lined up opposite us is a snarling defender.

               once again, over loud breathing, we can just hear the shouted 
               count.

               at "hike!" we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging 
               at us. his mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific 
               close-up he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort 
               audible over our own ragged breath.

               with a primal roar from the defenseman our pov tips back and 
               up, booming down to stop with a crunch against the ground, 
               staring up. once again our breathing has stopped.

               after a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming 
               running back steps on us in his charge downfield. he is 
               pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of 
               whom by the sound of it step on various body parts.

               huddle

               the same back-and-forth pan.

                                     quarterback
                         okay, epsilon twenty-two! you the 
                         man!... hey! butthead!

               this brings our wandering attention panning back to the 
               quarterback:

                                     quarterback
                         you the man!

               a very, very present voice (hudson):

                                     hudson (o.s.)
                         me the man?

                                     team
                         huh!

               line of scrimmage

               the same breathing and count.

               on "hike!" we sprint downfield.

               the same distant defender sprinting toward us.

               we hear low but very present a dismayed:

                                     hudson (o.s.)
                         unh... oh no...

               our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we 
               continue to run.

               we look back.

               every player is looking directly at us.

               a huge spiralling football coming at us -- too close, too 
               soon -- and--

               bonk!

               it bounces off our mouth guard and flies up.

                                     hudson (o.s.)
                         ...shit...

               we are looking forward just as

               crunch!

               we are hit by the defender.

               we once again land face-up.

               very steeply foreshortened, right over us, we see the defender 
               juggling the live ball.

               with a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball 
               and the high, distant defender.

               he finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and 
               starts back upfield.

               we climb wearily to our feet. we look back upfield just in 
               time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in 
               the end zone. he pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand 
               directly at us, then resumes his strut.

               shouting from the sidelines brings our panning attention 
               over.

               the coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and 
               using his clipboard to wave us off the field.

               we trot toward the sidelines.

               all of our teammates stare at us Â–- some in shock, some in 
               anger, some in pity.

               at the sideline bench our pov swings round as we seat ourself. 
               a hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet 
               and we

                                                              match cut to:

               our first objective shot as the player (hudson) finishes 
               pulling off his helmet. he is a big blond boy. his entire 
               body, including his face, is solidly built.

               an offscreen voice:

                                     coach (o.s.)
                         hudson!

               the boy, hudson, turns to look, and we cut to one last

               pov

               the coach is striding up, swinging his clipboard at the 
               camera: with a loud crunch! it brings on:

               black
