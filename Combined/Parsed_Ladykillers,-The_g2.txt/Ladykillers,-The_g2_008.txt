               int. munson house - living room - night

               the candles below the portrait of othar go out, sending up 
               thin wisps of smoke.

               i/e. munson house - foyer - night

               the cat shrieks and bolts out the door, past the man on the 
               stoop: goldthwait higginson dorr, iii.

               he is a middle-aged southern gentleman wearing a panama hat 
               and a cape over a cream-colored suit. he has dark circles 
               under his eyes. the smile he attempts, mournful yet courtly, 
               is wiped away by:

                                     mrs. munson
                         pickles!

                                     dorr

                                     mrs. munson

                                     mrs. munson
