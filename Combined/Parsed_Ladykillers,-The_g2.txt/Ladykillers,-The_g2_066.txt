               int. casino - vault - day

               clark and lump, covered in dirt and plaster dust, have started 
               stuffing bundled bills and small sacks into large garbage 
               bags. an irregular hole, about three feet across, gapes in 
               the far wall.

               gawain punches off the boombox, looking at all the money.

                                     gawain
                         well ain't that somethin'.

               clark suddenly freezes in the act of collecting money. he 
               straightens slowly.

                                     pancake
                         hnnnn. arrunggggh! rnffff.

               he stands stock still, wincing, gazing off into space.

                                     pancake
                         ...mmmmnggh!

               he whispers hoarsely, urgently:

                                     pancake
                         ...ibs!

               the other men look at him.

                                     gawain
                         ...say what?

                                     pancake

                                     gawain
                         oh man, you shouldn't be using the 
                         men's room--

                                     pancake

                                     gawain

                         in the goddamn crapper!

               clark's voice is still hoarse. he does small knee bends of 
               urgency:

                                     pancake

                         condition!
