               int. munson house - cellar - day

               the men, having drunk deep, are setting down their glasses. 
               pancake looks at his watch with some concern.

                                     pancake
                         charge should've gone off already.

                                     dorr
                         i do beg your pardon?

                                     pancake
                         the charge to collapse the tunnel. i 
                         set it for eight minutes.

               dorr looks at his watch.

                                     dorr
                         well that time, and more, has most 
                         certainly elapsed.

               from inside the tunnel

               looking toward the mouth. the men stoop over and peek 
               fearfully in.

               they again stand upright. a silence.

               dorr clears his throat.

                                     dorr
                         i need not remind you of the 
                         importance of obliterating any trace 
                         of a connection between the vault 
                         and this house. it was of the essence 
                         of this plan that it should appear 
                         that the money had simply vanished. 
                         without a trace. spirited away, as 
                         it were, by ghosts.

                                     pancake
                         of course. i understand.

                                     dorr
                         the conundrum of the undisturbed yet 
                         empty vault, the unsolvable riddle 
                         of the sealed yet violated sanctum, 
                         is of the utmost importance not only 
                         to make our caper innelectually 
                         satisfying. it is also exigent as a 
                         matter of practical fact: i remind 
                         you that if a tunnel is ever found 
                         leading to this house, this house's 
                         owner knows all of your names.

                                     pancake
                         she certainly does.

                                     dorr
                         therefore -- to draw the unavoidable 
                         conclusion -- someone shall have to 
                         reenter the tunnel to reset that 
                         charge.
