               the cat, with a human finger in its mouth, sidles cautiously 
               to one side, warily eying someone.

                                     voices (o.s.)
                         get him!

               the general, pluming cigarette in his mouth, tensed arms 
               extended outwards, sidles cautiously to cut him off.

                         i propose that we get our fallen 
                         comrade to the hospital, and the 
                         general shall follow when he manages 
                         to recover the severed digit.

                         about.

               the cat jumps.

               the general leaps to follow.
