               int. munson house - cellar - night

               close on a fist

               with three protruding straws.

               sweating close-ups:

               lump picks a long straw: relief.

               the general picks a short straw. a short grunt.

                                     dorr
                         excellent. i believe, at last, we 
                         have the right man for the job.
