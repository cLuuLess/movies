               int. munson house - living room - night

               the voices approach:

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...we was just havin' tea, talkin' 
                         about othar--

               the two enter and mrs. munson stops short, looking.

               the living room is empty. even the professor's teacup is 
               gone.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...hm... bussed his own dishes. you 
                         can always tell a gentleman.

               the sheriff, hat in hand, gazes about.

                                     sheriff
                         someone was here, ma'am?

                                     mrs. munson
                         mm-hm, with me'n othar.

               once again, he tries to excuse himself:

                                     sheriff
                         well, maybe i'll catch him next 
                         time...

                                     mrs. munson
                         come on up to his room.
