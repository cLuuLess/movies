               ext. munson house - night

               quiet.

               the two women sit in the idling car, looking at the house.

               from the house there is very muted bellowing.

               still looking toward the house, mrs. munson offers a word of 
               explanation to her friend:

                                     mrs. munson
                         they using the house to practice 
                         music a the rococo.
