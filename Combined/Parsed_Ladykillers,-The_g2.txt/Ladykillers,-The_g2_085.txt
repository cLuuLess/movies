               int. tunnel - day

               pancake now has a mini-mag light clenched between his teeth, 
               aimed down at the timer. he opens the phillips head on his 
               leatherman but abruptly stops and stares off into space.

                                     pancake
                         nnnnrungh...

               he is squinting with pain.

               the muffled hip-hop song is beginning to recede.
