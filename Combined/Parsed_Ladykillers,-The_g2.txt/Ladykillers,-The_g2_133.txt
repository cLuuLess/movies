               ext. mississippi river - bridge - day

               pickles scurries along the walkway. we hear the toot! of an 
               approaching scow.

               the cat reaches the middle of the bridge. he sticks his head 
               through the bars of the railing.

               when we cut close on the cat as he looks down at the water, 
               we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger.

               as the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and 
               lets the finger drop.

               the finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it 
               hits the scow.

               the cat looks up into the lens, and blinks. its sideways 
               irises adjust.

               the scow is gliding away. with the low mournful toot of its 
               horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where 
               scavenger birds pick through the trash.
