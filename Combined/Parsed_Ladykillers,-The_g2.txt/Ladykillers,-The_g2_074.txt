               int. munson house - cellar - day

               we are looking from inside the tunnel towards its mouth, 
               where the professor stoops slightly to peer in, anxiously 
               dry-washing his hands.

               a reverse shows the hunched-over men scuttling along the 
               tunnel towards us, holding large garbage sacks.

                                     dorr

                         very delighted...

               he gives a hand down to each man as he exits the tunnel.

                                     dorr
                         ...congratulations. congratulations.
