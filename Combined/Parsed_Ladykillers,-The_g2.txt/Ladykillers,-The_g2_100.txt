               int. munson house - foyer - later (evening)

               the bustling and chattering ladies are just finishing leaving; 
               mrs. munson is seeing them off at the door. evening is 
               gathering, and we hear the lonely toot of the distant garbage 
               scow.

               the men as well stand by the door and, affecting good cheer, 
               wave off the departing ladies.

                                     dorr
                         goodbye, ladies. we had such a 
                         pleasant time.

               mrs. munson closes the door and her manner instantly darkens.

                                     mrs. munson
                         now, i wanna know what's goin' on.

                                     dorr
                         yes indeed, and the thirst for 
                         knowledge is a very commendable thing. 
                         though in this instance, i believe 
                         when you hear the explanation, you 
                         will laugh riotously, slappin' your 
                         knee and perhaps even wipin' away a 
                         giddy tear, relieved of your former 
                         concern.

                                     mrs. munson
                         hmph.

                                     dorr
                         you see lump here is an enthusiastic 
                         collector of indian arrowheads and, 
                         having found one simply lying on 
                         your cellar floor, a particularly 
                         rare artifact of the natchez tribe, 
                         he enlisted us in an all-out effort 
                         to sift through the subsoil in search 
                         of others. well, in doing so, we 
                         apparently hit a motherlode of natural 
                         gas -- i myself became acutely aware 
                         of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and 
                         it was at just this unfortunate moment 
                         that the general here violated one 
                         of the cardinal rules of this house 
                         and lit himself a cigarette.

               the general stiffly bows:

                                     general
                         so sorry.

               the professor, nodding, smiling, and dry-washing his hands, 
               continues to look at mrs. munson, though his story, 
               apparently, has ended.

               she returns his ingratiating look with a stare.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...what about all that money?

               dorr's smile fades.

                                     dorr
                         ...ah. the money. the money is... 
                         mr. pancake's.

                                     pancake
                         that's right.

                                     dorr
                         he only just re-mortgaged his house 
                         in order to pay for the procedure 
                         that will correct the wandering eye 
                         of his common-law wife, mountain 
                         water, who suffers from astygmia and 
                         strabismus and a general curdling of 
                         the vitreous jelly. mr. pancake 
                         however is an ardent foe of the 
                         federal reserve and is in fact one 
                         of those eccentrics about whom one 
                         occasionally reads, hoarding his 
                         entire life savings either under the 
                         proverbial mattress or, as in mr. 
                         pancake's case, in a hefty bag that 
                         is his constant companion.

               under her stare, he elaborates:

                                     dorr
                         ...steel sack.

                                     pancake
                         don't trust the banks. never have.

               she thinks, decides.

                                     mrs. munson
                         this don't smell right. i'm callin' 
                         sheriff wyner.

               a chorus of gasps.

                                     dorr
                         madam -- if you please. yes! yes! it 
                         was a lie! a fantastic tale! you 
                         have us! dead to rights! but please 
                         allow me to tell you the truth -- in 
                         private.
