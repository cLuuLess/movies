               ext. saucier, mississippi - day

               mrs. munson is walking home. it is a beautiful spring day.

               from far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear 
               the church chorus singing. mrs. munson joins in. she has a 
               strong voice:

                                     mrs. munson
                         leaning, leaning, safe and secure 
                         from all harm. lean on jesus, lean 
                         on jesus, leaning on the everlasting 
                         arm.

               she turns up the walk to her house.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...what a fellowship, what a peace 
                         of mind, safe and secure from all 
                         harm. lean on jesus, lean on jesus, 
                         leaning on the everlasting arm...

               when she opens the front door the cat slips out.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...pickles!

               it races off down the street.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...pickles!
