               he escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of othar, sits 
               across from her, and leans confidentially in.

                                     dorr
                         madam...

               he agonizes. the words do not come easy.

                                     dorr
                         ...what i am about to reveal to you, 
                         you may find... shocking. mrs. munson, 
                         i must tell you that we are not... 
                         what we appear.

                                     mrs. munson
                         mm-hm.

                                     dorr
                         we are not in fact musicians of the 
                         late renaissance. nor of the early 
                         or mid period. we are, in fact... 
                         criminals! desperate men, madam! we 
                         have tunneled into the nearby offices 
                         of the lady luck gambling emporium 
                         and have relieved it of its treasure!

                                     mrs. munson
                         lord have mercy!

                                     dorr
                         it is true that the lady luck is a 
                         den of iniquity, a painted harlot 
                         luring people into sin and exciting 
                         the vice of greed with her false 
                         promise of easy winnings. oh, her 
                         gains are ill-gotten, yes, but i 
                         offer no excuses -- save one! we men 
                         have each pledged half of our share 
                         of the booty to a charitable 
                         institution -- the general, to a 
                         placement service for southeast asian 
                         refugees; mr. pancake to the blue 
                         ridge parkway conservancy; and lump 
                         to the united jewish appeal. as 
                         compensation for use of your house 
                         we had planned to donate a full share 
                         to bob jones university, without 
                         burdening you with guilty knowledge 
                         by informing you of same. but you 
                         have wrested the information from 
                         me! now it is all on the table. now 
                         you have it, the whole story, the 
                         awful truth.

                                     mrs. munson
                         stolen money!

                                     dorr
                         yes, yes, shamefully i admit it, 
                         yes! but find the victim, mrs. munson, 
                         i challenge you! even the casino 
                         itself, that riparian gomorra, shall 
                         suffer no harm! it has an insurance 
                         company, a financial behemoth that 
                         will cheerfully replenish its depleted 
                         vaults! that is its function! and 
                         the insurance company itself is made 
                         up of tens and tens of thousands of 
                         policy-holders so that -- we have 
                         done the calculations, mrs. munson! -- 
                         so that at the end of the day, at 
                         the final reckoning, each policy-
                         holder shall have contributed only 
                         one penny -- one single solitary 
                         cent -- to the satisfaction of this 
                         claim.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...just one penny?

                                     dorr
                         think of it, mrs. munson! one cent 
                         from thousands upon thousands of 
                         people so that bob jones university 
                         can continue on its mission! why, i 
                         have no doubt that, were the policy-
                         holders aware of the existence of 
                         that august institution, why, each 
                         and every one of them would have 
                         volunteered some token amount to the 
                         furtherance of its aims!

                                     mrs. munson
                         well that's prob'ly true...

               the professor, warming, has resumed dry-washing his hands:

                                     dorr
                         yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain 
                         is upon my soul, but the benefit 
                         shall accrue to any number of worthy 
                         causes. as long, that is, as the 
                         secret stays with us. and i, surely, 
                         shall not be the one to divulge it.

               mrs. munson nods, musing.

                                     mrs. munson
                         well... it's hard to see the harm in 
                         it... one penny...

               her gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm 
               her face. the smile freezes, though, as her look catches on 
               something.

               her pov: othar, above the mantle, looks down with a 
               disapproving scowl.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...i'm sorry, professor.

               dorr is taken aback:

                                     dorr
                         excuse me, ma'am?

                                     mrs. munson
                         no. it's wrong. don't you be leadin' 
                         me into temptation.

                                     dorr
                         madam, i must strenuously protest--

                                     mrs. munson
                         no, it's just plain wrong. stealin'. 
                         i know your intentions were good, 
                         and i won't call the police if you 
                         give the money back. but i gotta see 
                         that you do it.

                                     dorr
                         madam--

                                     mrs. munson
                         and all a you gotta go to church 
                         with me next sunday.

               the professor is incredulous:

                                     dorr
                         and... engage in divine worship?

                                     mrs. munson
                         i made up my mind. you can double-
                         talk all you want, but its church or 
                         the county jail.

                                     dorr
                         but--

               she rises.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you think it over. i gotta feed the 
                         cat.
