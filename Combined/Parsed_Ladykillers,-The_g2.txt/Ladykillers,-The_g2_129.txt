               int. munson house - cellar - day

               mrs. munson is walking down the stairs.

                                     mrs. munson
                         professor!

               she stops midway down and looks:

               the empty cellar.

               money stacked neatly on the card table.

               mrs. munson sadly shakes her head.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...hmm. couldn't face the music.
