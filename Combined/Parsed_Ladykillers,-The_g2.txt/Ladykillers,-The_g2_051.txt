               ext. munson house - night

               --and there is the dull thud of an explosion and the house's 
               windows rattle in their frames.

               the professor, at the open door of the car into which the 
               two ladies have just sat, looks up at the house, as do the 
               ladies.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...what in the name of heaven was 
                         that?

               dorr stares at the house, appalled.

                                     dorr
                         i'm... quite sure... that there is... 
                         no cause for alarm...

               he struggles for self-possession.

                                     dorr
                         ...why, i'm not even absolutely 
                         certain that i heard anything at 
                         all.

                                     mrs. munson
                         didn't hear anything?!

                                     dorr
                         well, something, perhaps, but...

               marva munson starts to get out of the car.

                                     dorr
                         ...nothing that need discompose us, 
                         was the sense i was trying to 
                         convey...

               he urges her back into her seat.

                                     dorr
                         ...miz munson, i will not have you 
                         missing your musical recital. why, 
                         you go ahead now. miz funthes, you 
                         as well, i beg of you...

               he is backing up the walk.

                                     dorr
                         ...i shall call the gas company, or 
                         the water company, or whatever 
                         subterranean utility is implicated 
                         in this little... occurrence... i 
                         shall see to the matter... as only a 
                         highly educated classicist could.

               at the door now, he gives the two women peering out the car 
               window a smiling but vigorous wave away, which they do not 
               heed, and then he enters.
