               int. soundstage - smoking field set - day

               high angle

               it is a ruin of a field; charred trees point bare and gnarled 
               limbs toward a gray sky; smoke drifts across the desolate 
               waste.

               something is bounding towards us from the deep background. 
               we boom down as it approaches: a bulldog, running avidly 
               toward us on its stumpy little legs.

               an offscreen male voice (clark pancake):

                                     pancake (o.s.)
                         one, mountain!

               there is an explosion that showers dirt in front of the dog 
               and makes it veer. something strapped around the dog's neck 
               bounces as he runs.

                                     pancake
                         ...scrub two! scrub three! four, 
                         mountain!

               another explosion makes the dog veer back so that it once 
               again bears on us. the thing that has been bouncing around 
               its neck flies off.

               our continuing boom down has brought us to ground level just 
               as the dog arrives in front of us to feed at a dog food bowl 
               in the foreground. the yellow plastic bowl has a k-ration 
               logo facing us.

               we hear another offscreen voice (director):

                                     director (o.s.)
                         cut, goddamnit. his canteen fell 
                         off.

               the director's feet enter in the foreground. he hooks the 
               dogs belly with one foot and hoists it roughly away from the 
               bowl. we

                                                                 cut up to:

               the director. he scowls down at the animal.

                                     director
                         ...props!

               a man in a hemingway field-jacket with multiple pockets, and 
               also a loaded utility belt, trots up toward him, his belt 
               jangling as he runs. this is clark pancake.

               pancake is a florid beer-bellied man in his late fifties. he 
               has a full blond-grey grizzly adams beard and wears multi-
               pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his hemingway 
               jacket.

               the director is angry.

                                     director
                         ...the goddamn thing's canteen fell 
                         off. it would have been a good take.

               pancake is unperturbed.

                                     pancake
                         okay. okay. we're prepared for that...

               he hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his 
               headset:

                                     pancake
                         ... mountain, bring otto with the 
                         apparatus.

               pulling another bulldog

               he strains at his lead, muscling forward as quickly as his 
               minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow.

               he peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather 
               gas mask, its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own 
               snout. his phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device.

               we tilt up the lead to show his minder, mountain girl. she 
               is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning 
               to merge into age spots. her long straw-colored hair is 
               tightly braided into heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon. 
               otherwise her dress is unadorned.

               the director squints at the dog.

                                     director
                         what the hell is this?

               pancake's manner is professorial:

                                     pancake
                         world war i vintage gas mask. it's 
                         authentic. strapped on, of course, 
                         so it can't fall off. the animal is 
                         free to be as active as he wants, 
                         doesn't inhibit his movement, and i 
                         think it really sells the whole 
                         doughboy thing--

                                     director
                         it looks like a fucking joke.

               pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not 
               doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort:

                                     pancake
                         ...nnnnrnff!

               the director squints at him:

                                     director
                         what?

               pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was:

                                     pancake
                         no, nothing, uh... you're absolutely 
                         right, the gas mask is a whimsical 
                         concept--

                                     director
                         how the hell does it eat when it 
                         gets to the kennel rations?

               the dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, 
               twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes. its breathing 
               is growing louder.

                                     pancake
                         well, you're absolutely right-

                                     director
                         don't let the client see this.

                                     pancake
                         of course not, that would be 
                         inappropriate--

                                     director
                         or the humane fucker.

                                     pancake
                         no no--

               the dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel, 
               breathing ever more loudly.

                                     director
                         they'll shut the fucking spot down, 
                         pancake. put the goddamn canteen 
                         back on. that says he's a soldier. 
                         dented tin canteen. just tie the 
                         damn thing to his collar.

               the dog flops over into the mud.

                                     pancake
                         easiest thing in the world. i just 
                         thought -- but the canteen is much 
                         better. good concept. let's go with 
                         that--

                                     director
                         what's he doing?

               the dog has started to convulse.

                                     pancake
                         well, he's uh... just breathe 
                         normally, otto.

                                     director
                         the fucking dog can't breathe.

                                     pancake
                         oh, he can breathe, that thing is -- 
                         just breathe normally, otto.

               the dog's breath is rasping and horrible.

                                     director
                         the fucking dog cannot breathe! get 
                         that fucking thing off him!

                                     pancake
                         of course. easiest thing in the world.

               he stoops and fiddles at the straps.

                                     pancake
                         ...it's on good and tight, i, uh... 
                         just breathe normally, otto.

               he starts thumping at his pockets.

                                     director
                         get the fucking thing off him!

                                     pancake
                         don't have my leatherman. mountain! 
                         give me your leatherman! chop chop!

                                     director
                         get the fucking thing off him! chitra, 
                         make sure the humane fucker doesn't 
                         come over here! bring him to craft 
                         services!

               as he makes to scoop up the dog:

                                     pancake
                         good idea! ice water, treats-

                                     director
                         not the dog, you idiot! the humane 
                         fucker! distract him!

                                     pancake
                         right! of course!

               he goes back to work on the mask.

                                     director
                         oh my god, he's bleeding!

                                     pancake
                         no, that's me -- i -- the 
                         leatherman... here we go.

               his hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas 
               mask off.

               a crowd is starting to gather and gape. the director barks 
               at a grip:

                                     director
                         put up a couple solids here -- i 
                         don't want the client seeing this!

               pancake thumps on the inert dog's chest.

                                     pancake
                         come on, otto!

                                     director
                         otto is fucking dead!

                                     pancake
                         mountain, have electric run me a 
                         stinger! don't give up on me, otto! 
                         mountain, i need two live leads!

               more people crowd in to look.

                                     mountain girl
                         clark, the gennie's a hundred yards 
                         away!

                                     pancake
                         goddamnit! otto's gonna have brain 
                         damage in about ninety seconds! okay!

               he pulls the dog's lips back, exposing its teeth and slobbered 
               tongue.

                                     pancake
                         ...kiss of life!

               he sucks in a deep breath and starts mouth-to-mouthing the 
               beast.
