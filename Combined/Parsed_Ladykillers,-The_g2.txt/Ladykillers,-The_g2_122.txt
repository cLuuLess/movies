               int. munson house - mrs. munson's bedroom - night

               the door swings noiselessly open. the general pauses to 
               survey:

               the still room. the ticking clock. mrs. munson, a large 
               sleeping mound upon the bed.

               the general advances, raising the garotte in both hands.

               he closes on her sleeping form.

               the garotte is lowered toward her exposed neck.

               it is a foot -- half a foot -- inches-away...

               somewhere a muted gear ratchets and triggers the toll of--

               the clock, striking one. it is a cuckoo clock but, instead 
               of a bird emerging, a berobed jesus comes out with his hand 
               resting on the head of a child who gazes up in adoration.

               the general starts at the noise and then suddenly freezes, 
               his eyes widening.

               jesus retreats back into the clock.

               the general has swallowed his cigarette.

               he reaches up to his throat, panicked. in a silent frenzy, 
               he yanks loose his ascot.

               he gazes wildly about.

               he reaches for the water glass at mrs. munson's bedside.

               he tips it back into his mouth. there is a rattling sound.

               his pov

               the uptilted water glass is sending false teeth -- full uppers 
               and lowers -- rattling toward his face.

               the general

               he frantically -- but still noiselessly -- sets the glass 
               back down. wildly looks about, one hand clamped to his throat.

               a mad but silent dash for the door.
