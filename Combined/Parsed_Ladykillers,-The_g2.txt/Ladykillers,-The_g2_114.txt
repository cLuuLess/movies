               ext. munson house - night

               we are pulling clark down the street, a satchel in either 
               hand.

               his pov

               the microbus, parked halfway down the block, ominously idling.

               the bus

               we are close on its side-view mirror. someone leans from the 
               driver's seat for a view into the mirror, and in the mirror 
               we see her, pigtails swinging: mountain girl.

               her pov

               clark pancake, still rather small, approaching up the empty 
               street.

               pancake

               pulling him again. a smile is beginning to play at the corners 
               of his mouth.

                                     pancake
                         no extra share, huh...

               the smile abruptly fades.

               he stops in his tracks for no discernible reason. at length:

                                     pancake
                         ...nnnrnf.

               he pants.

               behind him, in the deep background, we see the general 
               bounding into the street and silently toward us.

                                     pancake
                         ...oof!

               the moment passes. pancake shakes his head, as if to clear 
               it, and resumes his walk.

               his pov

               we are nearing the bus.

               the bus

               mountain girl sits in the idling bus, waiting.

               with a thunk and a gentle rock of the bus, we hear its back 
               doors opening, and pancake's voice.

                                     pancake
                         mountain.

                                     mountain girl
                         clark.

               we hear an oof! of exertion as pancake hoists each of the 
               two satchels into the back. the oofs are followed by:

                                     pancake
                         ...nnrungh! aaarmh... ninnnff... 
                         offffflleghhll...

                                     mountain girl
                         ibs, dear?

                                                                 we cut to:

               the back of the bus

               to show pancake being garotted by the general.

                                     pancake
                         nnnnnmmmmfffgh!
