               int. munson house - cellar - night

               the men all sit around the card table, lit from below by an 
               oil lamp. the general is neatly packing the stacks of 
               banknotes into the sackbutt case.

                                     gawain
                         motherfuck!

                                     dorr
                         yes. unfortunately, mrs. munson has 
                         rather complicated the situation--

                                     gawain
                         i know how to discomplicate it! put 
                         a cap in the old lady's head! then 
                         everything simple again!

               the group lapses into silence, considering. even gawain needs 
               a moment to digest the horror that he himself has proposed.

               the professor is solemn:

                                     dorr
                         ...not easy to do. many reasons. 
                         practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, 
                         a sleepy town. reasons of moral 
                         repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed 
                         conceived and executed in cold blood. 
                         no, gawain; would that it were simple!

                                     gawain
                         well -- fuck, man! what we gonna do, 
                         give the money back and go to church?!

                                     dorr
                         i shudder. i quake.

               he turns to the general.

                                     dorr
                         ...you sir, are a buddhist. is there 
                         not a middle way?

               the general grunts as he closes the clasps on the sackbutt 
               case full of money:

                                     general
                         must float like a leaf on the river 
                         of life. and kill old lady.

               the men murmur.

                                     dorr
                         well... i suppose you are right. it 
                         is the active nature of the crime, 
                         though, that so horrifies -- the 
                         squeezing of the trigger, the plunging 
                         of the knife. but, think a moment -- 
                         look at the other tools we have at 
                         hand.

               he looks around.

                                     dorr
                         ...we have the cellar. we have masonry 
                         and trowel. perhaps we could simply... 
                         immure her.

                                     pancake
                         sure, easiest thing in the world. i 
                         could whip up a little mortar in one 
                         of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, 
                         anchor in some chains, mountain has 
                         a source for the manacles...

                                     dorr
                         ahh but gentlemen, we delude 
                         ourselves. think of the woman's 
                         piteous moans as we lay tier upon 
                         tier of brick. think of her 
                         lamentations as we fit the last brick 
                         into place, appealing to our better 
                         selves, the higher angels of our 
                         nature, our recollections of our own 
                         sainted mothers... no, i fear that 
                         we lack the sand to commit such an 
                         act. no... no... shortest and most 
                         painless is best. let us confront 
                         reality. gawain's gun... the retort 
                         muffled by a pillow... into the 
                         brain... the affair of an instant. 
                         the only question is... who wields 
                         the weapon.

               he looks around the table. silence. no volunteers.

                                     dorr
                         ...i believe it is traditional, in 
                         such circumstances, to draw straws.

                                     pancake
                         well, sure, fair enough.

               he takes a broom leaning against the wall, bends back and 
               snaps a handful of its bristles.

                                     pancake
                         ...i'm thinking, though, that since 
                         i lost my finger -- i mean, literally 
                         lost it because of that goddamn cat -- 
                         maybe i should be excused from this 
                         thing. hard for me to squeeze a 
                         trigger anyway--

                                     gawain
                         you one whiney motherfucker! i squeeze 
                         your nutsack you keep that up!

                                     pancake
                         listen, punk--

                                     dorr
                         gentlemen, no special pleading, no 
                         exceptions. it's in the nature of 
                         the situation that we would all prefer 
                         to be excused.

               pancake grumbles as he counts out five bristles, takes one 
               and snaps it in half, displaying the short straw to the group, 
               and then hands the four long and one short to the professor:

                                     pancake
                         well, okay... it was just a trial 
                         balloon...

               with a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and 
               encloses them in one hand.

               sweaty close-ups. each man stares at the straws. some 
               hesitant, some resolute, they draw:

               first, the general: long straw. his reaction: impassive.

               next, lump: long straw. his reaction: relieved.

               next, pancake. long straw.

                                     pancake
                         long straw. you all see it. all your 
                         fuss over nothing, punk.

               two straws left. gawain stares at them, licks his lips.

               he reaches for one straw, touches it, hesitates.

                                     gawain
                         ...motherfucker...

               he touches the other straw, hesitates.

               he goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, 
               closes his eyes, and pulls.

               he lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, 
               raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to 
               look: short straw.

               the professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he 
               holds the last long one.

               gawain moans.
