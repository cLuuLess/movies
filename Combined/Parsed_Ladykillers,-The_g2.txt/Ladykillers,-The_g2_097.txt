               int. munson house - living room - day

               the chattering ladies are gathered at the table, mrs. munson 
               pouring them tea.

               the cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say 
               gothically -- ajar, and the professor peers out with an 
               ingratiating smile.

                                     dorr
                         hsst... madam...

               the chattering abates and the ladies all look at him. his 
               smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward 
               mrs. munson.

                                     dorr
                         ...mrs. munson, if i might have a 
                         word...

                                     mrs. munson
                         you get back down those stairs!

                                     dorr
                         i assure you i shall be--

                                     mrs. munson
                         hush! down those stairs! we havin' 
                         tea now! i be down shortly.

               he nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut.

               the ladies look inquisitively at mrs. munson as his footsteps 
               are heard descending the stair.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...he's the tenant.

                                     ladies
                         mm-hm.
