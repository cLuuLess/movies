               int. munson house - dorr's bedroom - night

               they enter a small bedroom. there is a small bed on a brass 
               frame, a chair, a wash basin, and cheerful yellow chintz 
               drapes on the window. dorr appreciatively takes it in.

                                     dorr
                         ...thoo-out central and southern 
                         mississippi. we perform on the 
                         instruments for which the music was 
                         originally composed, in the belief 
                         that... that... why, this is lovely...

                                     mrs. munson
                         wait a minute. you got some kind of 
                         band?

               dorr once again wiggles quotes with his fingers:

                                     dorr
                         the word "band" would be, in this 
                         context, something of an anachronism. 
                         though we do play together -- hence 
                         the word "ensemble" -- the nature of 
                         the music is such that one would 
                         hesitate to apply the epithet "band" 
                         with its connotations of jangling 
                         rhythm and ear-popping amplification.

                                     mrs. munson
                         so you don't play hippity-hop, "i 
                         left my wallet in el segundo," songs 
                         with the titles spelt all funny?

                                     dorr
                         madam, i shudder. i quake. the 
                         revulsion i feel for modern popular 
                         music, and all other manifestations 
                         of contemporary decay, is, i have no 
                         doubt, the equal of y'own. why, we 
                         play music that was composed to the 
                         greater glory of god. devotional 
                         music. church music.

                                     mrs. munson
                         gospel music?

                                     dorr
                         well-inspired by the gospels, 
                         certainly. the vintage, of course, 
                         is no more recent than the rococo.

                                     mrs. munson
                         rococo, huh? well, i guess that'd be 
                         okay.

                                     dorr
                         but i certainly don't propose to 
                         inflict our rehearsals on you. may i 
                         enquire -- do you have a root cellar?
