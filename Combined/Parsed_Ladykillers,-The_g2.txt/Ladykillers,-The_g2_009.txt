               ext. munson house - night

               dorr walks down the stoop followed by the old lady.

                                     mrs. munson
                         oh, he's up the tree again. your 
                         gonna have to shimmy on up.

                                     dorr
                         i am so terribly sorry, madam. but 
                         won't the feline eventually tire of 
                         his lonely perch and, pining for his 
                         master's affection, return on his 
                         own initiative?

                                     mrs. munson
                         huh? no, he won't come down less you 
                         fetch him. he'd set there til gabriel 
                         blows his horn if someone didn't 
                         shimmy up. up with you now!

                                     dorr
                         well then couldn't we perhaps offer 
                         him kitty treats and enticements, or 
                         if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky 
                         little toys of the kind formerly 
                         manufactured in hong kong but now 
                         produced in the other so-called 
                         "little tigers"...

               his fingers form the quotes.

                                     dorr
                         ...of the pacific rim? the point 
                         bein', do we have to actually ascend 
                         the tree--

                                     mrs. munson
                         look, i don't want no doubletalk. if 
                         you ain't gonna fetch him down i 
                         guess i gotta call the po-lice...

                                     dorr
                         police...

               his face darkens.

                                     mrs. munson
                         they ain't gonna be happy. every 
                         time they come fetch him down they 
                         swear they won't do it no more...

               dorr casts his hat aside and starts awkwardly climbing the 
               tree. he gasps as he climbs:

                                     dorr
                         no need to call the authorities. i 
                         did this often as a youth -- why, i 
                         was a positive lemur... here, kitty...

               the cat backs away down a branch, arching its back and 
               hissing.

                                     mrs. munson
                         don't upset him, now!

               dorr, on his stomach, inches after the cat, grunting:

                                     dorr
                         i wouldn't dream of it... harmless 
                         little felix domesticus... come to 
                         g.h...

               the branch breaks, hinging down to slam dorr face-first into 
               the trunk, from where he drops the rest of the way to the 
               ground.
