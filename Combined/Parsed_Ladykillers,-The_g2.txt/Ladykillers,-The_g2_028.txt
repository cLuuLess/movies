               int. munson house - cellar - day

               the general stands stock still, his nose an inch away from 
               the earthen wall, studying it, squinting through the smoke 
               of the cigarette pinched between his lips.

               the rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out 
               the instruments. gawain's case contains, however, not a 
               musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes. he loads 
               one of the tapes into the machine.

                                     dorr
                         what do you think, general? present 
                         any problems?

               after a beat the general turns away from the wall to give 
               dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing.

               gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled 
               with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music.

               dorr nods.

                                     dorr
                         ...good then.

               he spreads a map open on the sackbutt case.

                                     dorr
                         ...all right, gentlemen, why don't 
                         we all crowd around and go over the 
                         plan.

               the biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north-south 
               pair of lines: a river. a boat icon sits at one edge and 
               from it a dotted rectangle extends inland.

               dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.

                                     dorr
                         ...this, gentlemen, is the lady luck, 
                         gambling den, cash cow, sodom of the 
                         mississippi delta -- and the focus 
                         of our little exercise. here is 
                         orchard street...

               he is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle 
               extending from the boat. the street is lined by small house 
               icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those 
               icons.

                                     dorr
                         ...and here is the residence of marva 
                         munson, the charming lady whom y'all 
                         met moments ago. gentlemen...

               bow taps emphasize:

                                     dorr
                         ...you... are... here. now. this 
                         brings us to this square...

               the bow indicates it, and then withdraws.

               dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins 
               to pace.

                                     dorr
                         ...gentlemen, i believe you are all 
                         aware that the solons of the state 
                         of mississippi, to wit, its 
                         legislature, have decreed that no 
                         gaming establishment shall be erected 
                         within its borders upon dry land. 
                         they may, however, legally float 
                         upon any watercourse defining a state 
                         boundary. but while the gambling 
                         activity itself is restricted to 
                         riverboats, no such restriction 
                         applies to the functions ancillary 
                         to this cash besotted bidnis. the 
                         casino's offices, locker rooms, 
                         facilities to cook and clean, and 
                         most importantly its counting houses-
                         the reinforced, secret, and super 
                         secure repositories of the lucre -- 
                         may all be situated... wherever. 
                         gawain -- where is wherever?

                                     gawain
                         say wha?

               dorr's smug smile fades. testily:

                                     dorr
                         where is the money?

                                     gawain
                         oh. end of every shift pit boss brings 
                         the cash down to the hold of the 
                         ship in the locked cash box; once a 
                         day all the cash boxes're moved to 
                         the counting room.

                                     dorr
                         and where is the counting room?

                                     gawain
                         well, uh... in that square there. 
                         where you pointing.

                                     dorr
                         and what, to flog a horse that if 
                         not at this point dead is in mortal 
                         danger of expirin', does the dotted 
                         square represent?

               gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to 
               him some trick.

                                     gawain
                         ...offices. underground.

               dorr's eyes close. a smile of feline contentment curls his 
               lips. he murmurs:

                                     dorr
                         underground... mmm... during the 
                         casino's hours of operation the door 
                         to the counting room is fiercely 
                         guarded, and the door itself is of 
                         redoubtable pittsburgh steel; when 
                         the casino is closed the entire 
                         underground complex is locked up and 
                         the armed guard retreats to the 
                         casino's main entrance. there, then, 
                         far from the guard, reposes the money, 
                         cosseted behind a five-inch-thick 
                         steel portal, yes, but the walls, 
                         gentlemen, the walls of that room, 
                         are but humble masonry, behind which 
                         is only the soft loamy soil deposited 
                         over the centuries by ol' man, the 
                         meanderin' mississip', as it fanned 
                         its way back and forth across this 
                         great alluvial plain...

               he has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall.

                                     dorr
                         ...this earth.

               he crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, 
               pleased with himself, he smiles.

                                     dorr
                         ...any questions?

               lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand.

                                     dorr
                         ...yes, lump?

                                     lump
                         what, uh... what does "cosseted" 
                         mean?

               once again dorr's smile fades. he does not dignify the 
               question with answer.

                                     dorr

                         gawain is the proverbial "inside

                         function could he possibly fill, 
                         what specialized expertise could he

                         in a project of such magnitude and 
                         such risks, it is traditional -- 
                         nay, it is imperative -- to enlist 
                         the services of a hooligan, a goon, 
                         an ape, a physical brute, who will
