               int. tunnel - day

               pancake, hunched over, scurries along the tunnel. he reaches 
               the remnants of a large rock, where the tunnel grows smaller.

               he drops to crawl position and elbows his way forward, 
               toolbelt clanking along.

               we are getting closer and closer to a muffled but thuddingly 
               bassy "i left my wallet in el segundo."
