               int. casino - gudge's office - day

               close on a box of chocolates

               the box is being pulled open.

                                     gudge (o.s.)
                         what the hell is this?

               wider

               shows gawain in mr. gudge's office as gudge, behind the desk, 
               looks at the gift-wrapped box.

                                     gawain
                         it's just my way of sayin', well, 
                         goddamnit, i don't know what it's 
                         like walkin' in your shoes, bein' 
                         all tightass and all, and you don't 
                         know what it's like to walk in my 
                         shoes, but, well...

               gudge is opening a card that was inside the box. its floral 
               front says in gold script, "i'm sorry... if i hurt your 
               feelings... "

                                     gawain
                         ...you know, there's the custodian, 
                         and then there's the man inside the 
                         custodian, y'understand what i'm 
                         sayin'...

               gudge opens the card. inside is a hundred-dollar bill.

                                     gawain
                         ...and that man has needs, dig, and 
                         i guess those needs, mr. gudge, which 
                         they usually involve women with big 
                         asses, well those motherfuckin' needs 
                         sometimes well up over the custodian 
                         like the motherfuckin' johnstown 
                         flood. but my point is it ain't gonna 
                         happen again. not if it's humanly 
                         possible...

               gudge reads the card, flips it over to look at its back.

                                     gudge
                         hmm...

                                     gawain
                         but jesus, if you'd seen the ass on 
                         that girl, mr. gudge, you'd a wanted 
                         her sitting on your face too.

                                     gudge
                         well, we're all human.

                                     gawain
                         ya damn skippy.

                                     gudge
                         this apology buys you a one-week 
                         probationary period. stay away from 
                         the customers, macsam.
