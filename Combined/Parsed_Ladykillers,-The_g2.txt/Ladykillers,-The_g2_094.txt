               int. munson house - living room - day

               mrs. munson is looking at the cellar door. dust drifts out 
               from under it.

               she takes a slow step towards it. another step. she opens 
               the door.

               there is no visibility in the cellar due to swirling clay 
               dust.

               she takes one step down the stairs, waving at the air in 
               front of her face.

               paper money wafts in and out of the dust.

               we hear voices:

                                     pancake (o.s.)
                         perfectly all right. not a problem.

                                     lump (o.s.)
                         well there sure as shit ain't no 
                         tunnel left.

               the clearing dust reveals the caped professor anxiously 
               dancing from foot to foot, gathering money out of the air. 
               as he reaches up to grab a bill that has him facing up in 
               mrs. munson's direction, he freezes.

               his pov reveals her through dissipating dust.

                                     mrs. munson
                         professor, i'm surprised.

               there is a long beat, through which all stare at her.

                                     dorr
                         ...properly speaking, madam, we have 
                         been surprised; you are taken aback. 
                         though i acknowledge that the sense 
                         you intend is gaining currency through 
                         increasing use.

               further dissipation of the dust reveals how much money there 
               is, settling now to cover the floor of the cellar.

                                     dorr
                         ...you have returned from your 
                         devotions betimes.

               we hear the ring of the doorbell.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i hadda fix tea. i wanna talk to 
                         you, professor, don't you be leavin'. 
                         and don't make any more noise! and 
                         you!

               she points at the general who, in the excitement, has 
               neglected to hide his ever-present cigarette.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...i told you, i don't want any 
                         smokin' in here!

               she clomps upstairs and shuts the cellar door.
