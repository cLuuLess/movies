               the general climbs into the tunnel with a garbage bagful of 
               money, followed by lump, likewise encumbered. lump hands 
               back out a satchel to gawain, who sets it on the vault floor 
               by the hole. from the way he handles it, it is quite heavy. 
               pancake, also with a bag of money, is getting ready to climb 
               in:

                                     pancake
