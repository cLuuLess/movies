               int. tunnel - day

               quiet here as well, now. pancake's moan trails off to nothing. 
               he relaxes. the moment, whatever it was, has passed.

               he looks back down at the unit, flicks it with his finger, 
               and it emits a soft beep.

                                     pancake
                         ...huh?

               he squints at the back of the unit.

               as it beeps again, he turns the unit over to look at its 
               face.

               the readout now says: 00:10.

               as he watches, peering down through the bottom of his glasses, 
               it continues to advance with a beep as each second slips by: 
               9... 8...

                                     pancake
                         ...what the--

               his eyes widen and he frantically shakes the unit. it 
               continues beeping. he briefly and sloppily tries to fit the 
               phillips head into one of the four screws on the back of the 
               unit but immediately gives up and starts a panicked wriggle 
               back up the tunnel, whimpering.
