               int. tunnel - day

               music once again muffled. pancake has reached a little led-
               displaying timer with leads trailing off of it.

               he grabs it, puts on his reading glasses, squints.

               the display shows: time remaining: 00:12.

               the colons in the display rhythmically blink, but the number 
               does not advance. for some reason, stuck.

                                     pancake
                         huh.

               he reaches to his tool belt, pulls out his leatherman.
