               int. hi-ho donut - day

               there is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum. glass 
               cases display donuts identified as glazed, jelly, and fancies. 
               fancies ooze yellow goo. the jelly on the jelly donuts is 
               developing a crust of age. the glazed also look moth-eaten.

               one customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the 
               little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. next to the 
               coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes.

               behind the counter is a middle-aged vietnamese woman in a 
               neat white blouse.

               the two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from 
               underneath their windbreakers.

                                     youth #1
                         all right dragon lady, give us all 
                         the fuckin' money!

               the woman stares blankly.

                                     youth #1
                         we want that donut money!

                                     vietnamese woman
                         yao gin nyap!

               a man appears from the kitchen in back. he is a middle-aged 
               vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit. 
               an ascot is knotted at his neck. he wears aviator eyeglasses. 
               in his mouth smolders a half-burned-down filterless cigarette. 
               this, we shall learn later, is the general.

                                     youth #2
                         okay papa-san, we want that donut 
                         money.

                                     youth #1
                         and we ain't fuckin' around, mr. hi-
                         ho.

                                     vietnamese woman
                         hi-ho.

               the two youths look at her briefly. nothing else is 
               forthcoming.

               the drunk looks up from his paper bag.

                                     youth #2
                         look, this fuckin' thing, it ain't 
                         complicated. you give us all the 
                         fuckin money, you don't get shot in 
                         the head, you make more donuts, get 
                         more money. that's how it works, 
                         see?

               the general stares at him. as with his wife, none of it seems 
               to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed.

                                     youth #1
                         give us the money!

               he is pointing the gun directly at the general's head.

                                     youth #1
                         ...you got three fuckin' seconds. 
                         you understand one-two-three? i'm 
                         gonna count one-two-three and then 
                         shoot. okay? three secÂ–- huh!

               the general has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside 
               the youth's nostrils. his gun clatters to the floor. the 
               fingers are way, way up his nose. only one knuckle shows on 
               each finger.

               the youth is staring cross-eyed at his own nose.

               his friend is also stupefied.

                                     youth #1
                              (very nasal)
                         his fingers are way the fuck up my 
                         nose.

                                     youth #2
                         get... ya fingas... out... the 
                         man's... nose!

               the general still impassively sucks on his cigarette. the 
               first youth is on the verge of tears:

                                     youth #1
                         i think they're in my brain, man...

                                     youth #2
                         motherfuck!

               he raises his gun to start firing.

               as he does so the general uses his hook-hold on the other 
               youth's nose to slam his head backwards, down into some 
               fancies.

               the door opens and a customer walks in, a semi-elderly lady 
               with a cane.

               youth #2, eyes rolling, wildly swings to cover the door, 
               then back to the general who has his friend's head pressed 
               into the fancies, then uncertainly over to the vietnamese 
               woman who is loudly yelling at him in vietnamese.

               cigarette still dangling from his lower lip, the general 
               calmly plucks a pot of coffee from the coffee warmer and 
               tosses it into youth #2's face.

               youth #2 screams.
