               int. munson house - cellar day

               as the professor rejoins the still staring and silent group. 
               the money has been picked up and is once again in stacks 
               upon the table.

                                     dorr
                         she shall be down shortly...

               explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head:

                                     dorr
                         ...tea. dainties.

               the men nod, murmuring.

               the cellar door squeaks open. there is the clomp of careful 
               footsteps on the stair.

               using only tongue and teeth, the general flips his smoking 
               cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives mrs. munson his 
               usual deadpan look.

               she halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron 
               and holding a spatula.

                                     mrs. munson
                         i don't know what you boys been up 
                         to but i wasn't born yesterday and i 
                         know mischief when i see it. now i 
                         want an explanation, but first i 
                         want you boys to get your fannies up 
                         here with y'alls period instruments. 
                         i been tellin' the ladies about your 
                         music and they wanna hear you play.

               she turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to 
               turn and give the general a hard look which he innocently 
               returns.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...hmph.

               she turns again and clomps back up the stairs.

               the general opens his mouth and, again without using his 
               hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower 
               lip.

               lump is fretful:

                                     lump
                         professor?

                                     dorr
                         yes, lump?

                                     lump
                         i can't really play the buttsack.
