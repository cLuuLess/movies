               the wire winds around into the room, back up to chair-rail 
               height, along one wall, behind some cabinetry which gawain 
               hurries past to find it again on the far side, and then down 
               to a video recorder.

               it is not, however, hooked up to the video recorder: its 
               pronged end swings loose just by where it would be plugged 
               in.

               inside the video recorder is a casette, which gawain ejects. 
               the men crowd to look over his shoulder as he examines it:

               "shevann's schvanz".

               there is a pile of other videos by the monitor: "charlayne 
               and the chocolate factory," "big dick blaque's big night 
               out," "lemme tell ya 'bout black chicks," "anus & andy." 
               just next to the pile is an old bowl of kocoa krispies.
