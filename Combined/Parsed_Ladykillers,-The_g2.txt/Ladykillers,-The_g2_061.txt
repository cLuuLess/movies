               int. casino - service hall - day

               gawain leans back against the wall next to the vault door, 
               arms folded across his chest. faintly, from inside the vault, 
               we hear the whine of a power tool. gawain leans over and 
               punches the button on boom box that hangs from the rolling 
               garbage bin. the hallway pulses with "i left my wallet in el 
               segundo."
