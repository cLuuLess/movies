               int. munson house - cellar - night

               a pull back shows that the cat is in fact back in the 
               basement.

               its pov: continued tunneling.

               back to the cat, watching, then turning its head at a noise:

               at the head of the stairs, the cellar door is opening.

               a whistle from the general and lump and clark pancake scramble 
               from the tunnel. they whip a curtain over its opening and 
               all men grab up their instruments as dorr, covering with a 
               cough, turns off the cd player.

               the general, his ever-present cigarette smoldering between 
               his lips, tongue-and-lips it up and backwards so that it is 
               inside his mouth, which he now closes.

               marva munson is heavily and carefully descending the stairs. 
               as the men come into view they are looking up at her, lump 
               holding his sackbutt but still glistening with sweat and 
               smeared with dirt.

                                     mrs. munson
                         that's okay, don't stop on account 
                         of me.

               lump looks around, saucer-eyed, then blows gamely into his 
               sackbutt. it sounds like goose farts until dorr waves him 
               down.

                                     dorr
                         no no, madam, we were about to take 
                         a break anyway. the glissandi on 
                         this particular piece are technically 
                         very demanding and i think we would 
                         all welcome a moment of relaxation.

                                     mrs. munson
                         huh. i just thought you might like 
                         to see-what a you gotten up to, honey? 
                         why you sweatin' like that.

               it is directed at lump, who looks down at his own sweat-
               stained undershirt.

                                     lump
                         i, uh...

                                     gawain
                         that man plays one bitch barrelful a 
                         sackbutt. ain't no one can blow the 
                         tenor sackbutt like lump, hoowee! 
                         goes at that thing like it was a pu-- 
                         uh, like it was a woman! goddamn! he--

               she cuffs him on the head.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you mind! i don't want that kind of 
                         talk in my home, even in the root 
                         cellar. this is a christian house, 
                         boy, none of that hippity-hop 
                         language.

                                     dorr
                         sadly, gawain is given to--

               whap! she slaps gawain again.

                                     mrs. munson
                         sometimes it's the only way!

               he untenses after what seemed like the final blow, but -- 
               whap! -- she slaps him again.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...i'm tryin' to help you, son!

               whap!

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...better yaself!

                                     dorr
                         as well you should, ma'am. but gawain 
                         at times is so far transported by 
                         his love of the music of the early 
                         renaissance as to--

                                     mrs. munson
                         don't make no never-mind he's 
                         transported!

               dorr has her by the elbow and is ushering her back up the 
               stairs.

                                     dorr
                         i understand your--

               she pulls her elbow away and sniffs.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you been smokin'?

                                     dorr
                         certainly not, madam. i understand 
                         your indignation. and i was offering 
                         explanation, not excuse. i myself am 
                         offended by those who cannot find 
                         the proper words to express themselves 
                         and have recourse to--

               gawain calls up the stairs:

                                     gawain
                         don't you be explainin' me, dawg! 
                         you can't look into my mind, cape 
                         man!

                                     dorr
                         yes, yes...

               dorr's tone is soothing as he shuts the door at the top of 
               the stairs.

                                     dorr
                         ...a fiery lad! but then youth is 
                         fiery! a fact often remarked upon by 
                         the poets of the romantic era.

                                     mrs. munson
                         my youth i was in church, i wasn't 
                         walkin' around fiery. youth ain't no 
                         excuse for nothin'! well, anyway... 
                         only came down to show you the fife.

               she hands him a thick, roughly whittled piece of cane. dorr 
               holds it, looks at it dumbly. he is, for the first time that 
               we have seen anyway, non-plussed.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...othar's fife. he burned his own.

               dorr tries to summon conversation as the two sit with their 
               backs to the fireplace:

                                     dorr
                         ...did he?

                                     mrs. munson
                         mm-hm. i thought maybe bein' a musical 
                         man you'd be interested.

                                     dorr
                         oh, i am indeed--

                                     mrs. munson
                         cut it himself and burned the holes. 
                         israelites called it a kalil.

                                     dorr
                         ah.

                                     mrs. munson
                         kalil, fife, same thing. you can 
                         read about it in the bible. ain't 
                         nothin' new under the sun.

                                     dorr
                         indeed not.

                                     mrs. munson
                         gone these twenty years. he was some 
                         kind of man.

               from othar's pov, slightly high, we see them both twist in 
               their chairs to look up at the portrait.

               reverse of the portrait, low angle. othar looks down at us 
               with what appears to be bemusement.

               marva munson and dorr gaze up at the portrait for a motionless 
               beat. at length, marva munson sighs:

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...blowed the kalil.

               dorr's eyes remain on the picture as he inquires:

                                     dorr
                         ...i don't suppose othar ever turned 
                         his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, 
                         turned his lip -- to the shofar?

               prompted by her silence, he adds:

                                     dorr
                         ...the ceremonial ram's horn, sounded 
                         by the priests of the hebrews?

                                     mrs. munson
                         i don't know nothin' 'bout that. 
                         othar didn't study no shofar, to the 
                         extent a my knowledge. the kalil was 
                         good enough for my othar...

               she gazes at the portrait.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...some kind of man.
