               ext. mississippi river - bridge - night

               the body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail.

               the professor stands looking at it, contemplatively.

               lump stands looking at it, contemplatively.

               the cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, 
               impassively.

               the professor muses:

                                     dorr
                         ...t'was our at√© brought us to this 
                         pass...

                                     lump
                         what, professor?

               there is the toot! of an approaching scow. dorr's manner is 
               still absent, his regard still on the corpse:

                                     dorr
                         our overweening pride... the old 
                         woman is a more potent antagonist 
                         than one had imagined...

               he rouses himself, goes over to the bagged corpse. lump 
               follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail.

                                     dorr
                         ...now, lump, i'm afraid it falls to 
                         you to finish the job.

               they let the body fall onto the scow passing below.

                                     dorr
                         ...the comedy must end.

               the professor turns to lump and tries to hand him gawain's 
               gun, but lump, uncomfortable, declines to take it.

                                     lump
                         ...professor, i been doing some 
                         thinking.

                                     dorr
                         oh dear. oh dear oh dear oh dear.

                                     lump
                         maybe she's right! maybe we should 
                         be going to church!

                                     dorr
                         oh dear, lump. i feared that those 
                         would be your words. not that i don't 
                         appreciate your giving the matter 
                         the benefit of your thought. but 
                         please recall, young man, our 
                         respective functions in this 
                         enterprise. i am a professor, the 
                         professor as you yourself so often 
                         say, the thinker, the "brains of the 
                         operation," trained in fact in the 
                         arts of cogitation. you, lump, are 
                         the goon, the hooligan, the dumb 
                         brute whose actions must be directed 
                         by a higher intelligence.

                                     lump
                         yeah, i know, but--

                                     dorr
                         no buts, dear boy! do not repeat the 
                         error of thinking! now is the moment 
                         of praxis! now, my dear boy, you 
                         must act!

               lump reluctantly takes the gun that the professor thrusts 
               upon him.

                                     lump
                         i can't do it, professor! a nice old 
                         lady like that!

                                     dorr
                         think of the riches, lump, that you 
                         and i alone shall divide! recall the 
                         dream of wealth untold that first 
                         drew you to this enterprise!

                                     lump
                         but--

                                     dorr
                         and reflect also that if you decline 
                         to act, forcing me to do so, then 
                         you shall no longer have any 
                         entitlement to the money! your offices 
                         shall have been nugatory!

                                     lump
                         you mean -- you mean -- you're gonna 
                         kill her?!

                                     dorr
                         of course! my hand would be forced!

                                     lump
                         i can't let you do that, professor! 
                         a nice old lady like that!

                                     dorr
                         you?! allow? not allow? what 
                         presumption! you stupid boy! you 
                         very very extremely stupid boy!

               we hear the toot of an approaching scow -- this one very 
               long, sustained under all of the following:

                                     lump
                         oh yeah?

               he points the gun at the professor and--

                                     lump
                         ...well who looks stupid now?

               --squeezes -- click -- on an empty chamber.

                                     lump
                         ...huh?

               he turns the gun to have a look.

                                     lump
                         ...no bullets?

               his pov

               shows the foreshortened barrel as he experimentally squeezes 
               the trigger.

                                                                 we cut to:

               the professor on the bang! and, after a sad shake of his 
               head,

                                                               cut back to:

               lump in time to see him finish toppling back over the rail.

               the scow-horn ends.

                                     dorr
                         perhaps... it had to be thus.

               he goes to the railing to look down.

               lump, face-up on a pile of garbage, glides away. disturbed 
               birds flap upward.

               the professor muses:

                                     dorr
                         "...lo, in yon brilliant window-niche 
                         how statue-like i see thee stand..."

               his gaze rises with the ascending birds.

               among the white gulls is one black bird. the professor eyes 
               it as it rises past him.

                                     dorr
                         ...hm. a raven?

               from very high

               we look down on the professor, the black bird rising to perch 
               on the gargoyle on the suspension tower in the foreground.

               the bird settles on a loose, teetering piece of masonry.

               back to the professor

               looking at the receding red light on the bridge of the 
               receding scow:

                                     dorr
                         "...the agate lamp within thy hand... 
                         "

               back high

               the teetering chunk of masonry tips away and the perchless 
               bird flaps off.

               back to the professor

               very dreamy: he sees something in the distance, beyond time 
               and space:

                                     dorr
                         ...ah, psyche! from the regions which 
                         are holy land!"

               this is punctuated by the crunching impact of masonry scoring 
               a direct hit on his head. he falls over the rail.

               his cape snags on the railing and he hangs limp and lifeless. 
               directly below his dangling body the stern of lump's barge 
               is slipping away to leave black waters and the clanking of 
               chains.

               the fabric of the professor's cape begins to tear. his body 
               drops in fits and starts as the fabric gives way.

               finally the body rips free. it falls away from us. as it 
               does so the clanking chains are pulling into view the second-
               banger -- a garbage barge being chain-towed by the receding 
               scow.

               dorr's body lands neatly on the barge.

               a gust of wind.

               the cape flaps free of the railing and is wind-tossed away 
               amidst the cawing birds.

               the cat, watching, blinks.
