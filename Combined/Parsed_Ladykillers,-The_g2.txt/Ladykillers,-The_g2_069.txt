               as the two men enter clark is still holding forth:

                                     pancake
                         ...i guess i never told you, that's 
                         how mountain girl and i met. they 
                         had an ibs weekend at grossinger's, 
                         in the catskills. of course the 
                         tourist business up there has 
                         suffered, with the demise of the 
                         borscht belt. so they have different 
                         promotions, mixers, so on. this was 
                         a weekend for irritable bowel singles 
                         to meet and support each other and 
                         share stories.

                                     gawain
                         man, i don't wanna hear a single one 
                         a them stories.

                                     pancake
                         well, some of them are very--

                                     gawain
                         not one fuckin' story! you one fucked-
                         up motherfucker! you--

               they stop short, looking:

               the general and lump are standing in the middle of the floor, 
               stock still, each clutching a bag of money, staring up at 
               the same corner of the ceiling.

               lump turns to clark and gawain.

                                     lump
                         hey, lookit that.

               gawain and clark join them in the middle of the vault and 
               look up at the corner of the ceiling.

               a small video camera, aimed squarely at the four men.

               through the camera

               black-and-white video, very wide angle high shot, of the 
               four motionless men below goggling up at the lens. smoke 
               plumes from the general's cigarette.

               back to normal perspective

                                     pancake
                         huh. looks like an ikegami.

               he slips on his reading glasses as he gets a leg up on a 
               shelf just below the camera and hoists himself. he peers in 
               at the lens.

               through the lens

               clark looming into extreme close shot.

                                     pancake
                         ...oh yeah. mm-hm. i'm not sure 
                         whether it's broadcasting...

               normal perspective

                                     pancake
                         ...um-hm... no...

               he is fingering the back of the camera.

                                     pancake
                         ...hard wire...

               down below, gawain looks at the wire snaking along the seam 
               of wall and ceiling. at the opposite corner it travels down 
               the joint of the two walls.

               he traces its path down and then across one wall at chair-
               rail height towards the door. the other men follow in an 
               anxious herd as he traces one finger along it.

               just before reaching the vault door the wire goes through 
               the wall in a hole finished off with a grommet. gawain goes 
               out the vault door...
