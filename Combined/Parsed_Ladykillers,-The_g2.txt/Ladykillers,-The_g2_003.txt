               int. saucier municipal building - day

               we hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound.

               we are drifting toward the door of the lock-up, which stands 
               open. the small cell is empty, its bed neatly made.

               a key

               we are arcing slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that 
               hangs from a nail. the offscreen snoring and whirring 
               continues.

               the track's shifting angle now makes the light catch a spider 
               web spun between the key and the wall.

               police scanner

               we drift across the face of the radio. the peaceful steady 
               hissing jumps in louder at the cut: it is uninterrupted: a 
               transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.

               the snoring is also louder here. as we travel off the radio 
               we are coming onto a pair of feet propped up on the desktop.

               they belong to sheriff wyner, tipped back in his chair, 
               fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.

               as the moving camera finally ends on him, there is the ring 
               of a telephone -- muffled, not present.

               it nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a 
               snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his 
               phone.

                                     sheriff wyner
                         sheriff wyner...

               the muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, 
               at the phone. now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled 
               voice next door:

                                     voice (o.s.)
                         worms.

               the sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts 
               his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the 
               front door open.

               the sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, 
               fear.

               he manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:

                                     sheriff wyner
                         afternoon, miz munson.

               entering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress 
               and fruited bonnet.

                                     mrs. munson
                         afternoon, sheriff. you know the

                                     mrs. munson

                                     sheriff wyner

                                     mrs. munson
                         well, he's a good boy but he done 
                         gone down to the costco in pascagoula

               wyner is not sure where this is going:

                                     sheriff wyner
                         uh-huh...

                                     mrs. munson

                                     sheriff wyner

                                     sheriff wyner

                                     mrs. munson

                                     mrs. munson

                         music, but it don't make me wanna go

                         and othar don't like that music 
                         neither!

               sheriff wyner now displays an exaggerated solicitousness:

                                     sheriff wyner
