               int. munson house - living room - night

               the room is filled with smoke.

               othar, slightly askew over the mantel, looks a little huffy.

               we hear clomping and screaming on the cellar stairs.

               lump bursts out, shrieking:

                                     lump
                         blood, professor! oh my god! blood!

               the general comes bounding up the stairs like a panther, a 
               cigarette burning in his lips. he lands catlike in the living 
               room, glides to the blubbering lump, grabs one shoulder firmly 
               with one hand, and with the other slaps him sharply, once 
               forehand, once backhand.

               lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short.

               more noise is coming from the stairs:

                                     pancake
                         ...why, it's nothing to make a fuss 
                         about. perfectly all right... happens 
                         all the time...

                                     gawain
                         ...you gotta go find it, dipshit!

               pancake emerges from the stairwell, his hair singed, his 
               face and the front of his jumpsuit darkened by the blast. he 
               is clutching one hand with the other.

                                     pancake
                         ...no, no. really, i'm perfectly all 
                         right.

               gawain has ascended just behind to hector him over his 
               shoulder:

                                     gawain
                         perfectly all right? you just blew 
                         your fucking finger off!

                                     pancake
                         sure, but--

                                     gawain
                         well get back down there and find 
                         it, man! i ain't pickin' up your 
                         goddamn finger!

                                     dorr
                         i gather there was a premature 
                         detonation--

                                     gawain
                         they can sew that shit back on, jack! 
                         like that guy his wife cut his dick 
                         off! just sewed that motherfucker 
                         back on!

                                     pancake
                         of course. simplest thing in the 
                         world. microsurgery--

                                     gawain
                         saw that motherfucker in a porno! 
                         thing still works!

               pancake is pale from loss of blood and his pontifications 
               lack full conviction:

                                     pancake
                         oh yes, they have remarkable abilities 
                         in the, uh...
