               ext. mini-mall / hi-ho donut - day

               high angle

               it is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a seven-
               eleven, a launderette, and a hi-ho donut. the hi-ho donut 
               sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much 
               smaller lettering: and croissants.

               a beat-up impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music. 
               after a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed. both front 
               doors open. two black kids get out and look around with a 
               manner that is if anything too casual.
