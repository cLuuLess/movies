               int. casino - day

               tracking on a garbage cart

               on the cart is a boombox. it is playing "i left my wallet in 
               el segundo."

               it is being pushed through a casino empty of customers.

               as the cart stops and a wastebasket is emptied into it:

                                     voice (v.o.)
                         you gotta peel this shit out sticks 
                         to the bottom.

               wider

               shows two youngish black men in the khaki uniforms of 
               custodians. emptying the wastebasket is weemack-mackatee 
               funthes. he is instructing gawain macsam.

                         ...you wouldn't believe this shit, 
                         sometimes even out here on the casino 
                         floor you gonna find sanitary napkin 
                         shit stuck there, tucks, i don't 
                         know what the fuck people do while 
                         they're gambling here man.

                                     gawain
                         i ain't peelin' funky shit with my 
                         human hands, man. that's a 
                         prescription for disease and viruses 
                         and shit, attackin' y'insides.

               as they roll on we see more of the gambling floor, which is 
               on something less than the scale of a las vegas casino. the 
               floor is not yet open and dealers stack and count chips at 
               the tables, pit bosses with clipboards looking over their 
               shoulders. other dealers strap on visors and sleeve garters, 
               preparing to work.

                                     weemack
                         you gotta do it. mr. gudge checks 
                         everything. man is a motherfuck. 
                         shit -- looka this.

               after a furtive look around he plucks a chip from the next 
               wastebasket and slips it in his pocket.

                                     weemack
                         ...you keep an eye out, man. i found 
                         a hundred-dollar chip once.

                                     gawain
                         fuck that, man. i ain't pawin' through 
                         used tucks for a fi' dollar chip.

                                     weemack
                         i said it was a hundred.

                                     gawain
                         man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n 
                         leak outcha fuckin' asshole.

               service hall

               the cart jitters loudly on the dimpled plastic floor.
