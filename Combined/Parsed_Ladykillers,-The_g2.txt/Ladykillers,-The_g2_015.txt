               the two men are entering a windowless fluorescent-lit office 
               area. a row of wooden office doors and one heavy steel door.

                         ...this is where they think on their 
                         corporate shit, gudge and them.

               he stops to empty a wastebasket.

                                     weemack
                         ...the lights is ugly but it ain't 
                         as many tucks.

               he bangs on the steel door:

                                     weemack
                         ...yo, motherfuck! lemme in!

                                     muffled voice (o.s.)
                         what's the password?

                                     weemack
                         kiss my ass.

               we hear a deep chuckle and the door, steel reinforced, swings 
               open.
