               int. munson house - cellar - night

               the professor clomps down the cellar stairs. pancake is 
               loading their digging implements into a satchel.

                                     pancake
                         they back yet?

               dorr is absent:

                                     dorr
                         yes... yes, they just arrived.

               pancake straightens from the satchel.

                                     pancake
                         good. i'll go dump these in the 
                         hearse.

               he mounts the stairs with a satchel in either hand. we can 
               hear the front door opening as the other men enter.

               dorr, bemused, but apparently moved by a hunch, advances 
               slowly to the sackbutt case.

               he slides the catch that lets its spring clasp pop up.

               he lifts the lid.

               mother jones magazine. piles of mother jones magazines.

                                     dorr
                         what in heaven's name...

               he riffles a pile, confirming that it is in fact all magazine, 
               no money.

               lump and the general are clomping down the stairs.

                                     dorr
                         ...general!
