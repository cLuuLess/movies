               the professor's eyes widen with concern as he hears the 
               voices, off:

                                     sheriff (o.s.)

               the sheriff is tipping his hat and already backing away, 
               trying to make his visit brief:

                                     sheriff

                         mm-hm.

               he calls from the bottom of the stoop:
