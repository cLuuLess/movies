               int. munson house - cellar - day

               the men are still frozen looking up toward the door. the 
               muted cackle of church ladies.

               the men gradually unfreeze.

                                     lump
                         she saw everything. she saw our 
                         hole...

               he turns to dorr, near tears:

                                     lump
                         ...she saw our hole, professor!

               dorr rubs his hands anxiously, thinking:

                                     dorr
                         yes... yes...

                                     lump
                         what do we do?

                                     dorr
                         well, first, my dear boy, we follow 
                         the general's example...

               the general remains staring up at the door, frozen but for 
               the smoke pluming from the cigarette in his mouth.

                                     dorr
                         ...and refrain from panic. secondly, 
                         we cooly, calmly, collectedly think... 
                         think...

               the gaze of all the men drifts back up to the cellar door, 
               and we look down at them, gazing up.
