               int. munson house - kitchen - day

               mrs. munson has stuffed the paper-enclosed bill into an 
               envelope, which she is now laboriously addressing to bob 
               jones university.

                                     mrs. munson
                         and the choir was all in good voice. 
                         mm-mm-

               there is a knock at the door.

                                     mrs. munson
                         ...who could that--

               the cat yowls and hisses.

               i/e. munson house - foyer - day

               as mrs. munson swings open the door.

               g.h. dorr stands on the stoop mournfully dry-washing his 
               hands and obsequiously ducking his head.

                                     dorr
                         my dear mrs. munson, i do so hope 
                         this is not an inopportune time for 
                         our first practice--

                                     mrs. munson
                         somebody die?

                                     dorr
                         i beg your-- oh!

               he looks back at the long black vintage lincoln hearse parked 
               at the curb behind him.

                                     dorr
                         ...no no, no bereavement, though it 
                         is so kind of you to enquire. no, 
                         the hearse is simply a vehicle 
                         commodious enough to accommodate all 
                         of the members of our ensemble. and 
                         of course our instruments, contrived 
                         in an age ignorant of 
                         miniaturization...

               he turns and gestures at the vehicle.

               at his sign, gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's 
               side.

               clark pancake emerges from the front passenger side.

               the general, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki 
               suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, 
               emerges from a back door.

               gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to 
               let out lump hudson, the football player.

               lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument 
               cases, each man taking one except for lump himself, who 
               carries two. as the parade of losers and misfits winds its 
               way up the walk:

                                     dorr
                         ...let me introduce you to my friends, 
                         my colleagues, these devoted and 
                         passionate musicians... this is gawain 
                         macsam, our bassoonist...

               gawain nods as he passes by.

                                     dorr
                         ...general nguyen pham doc, viola da 
                         gamba...

                                     mrs. munson
                         no smoking in this house.

               the general tosses his cigarette away and bows stiffly as he 
               passes.

                                     general
                         so sorry.

                                     dorr
                         ...clark pancake -- a multi-
                         instrumentalist, but with his 
                         remarkable embosser clark specializes 
                         in wind instruments, and is especially 
                         accomplished on the french horn...

               he nods, passes.

                                     dorr
                         ...and, finally, aloysius "lump" 
                         hudson. lump is our sackbuttist and -- 
                         thank you, lump -- i see you've also 
                         brought my fiddle...

               as he hands dorr the violin case:

                                     lump
                         here's your fiddle, doctor.

               mrs. munson sizes up the group.

                                     mrs. munson
                         you ain't gonna make a racket, are 
                         ya?

                                     dorr
                         oh no. oh no no no no no. no, we 
                         shall recuse ourselves to the basement 
                         where we shall be -- i think here 
                         the expression is uniquely 
                         appropriate...

               he gives a sickly smile.

                                     dorr
                         ...as quiet as the crypt.

                                     mrs. munson
                         hmph.
