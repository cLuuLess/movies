               int. munson house - living room - night

               the cellar door

               creaking open. the professor, lump, and the general peek 
               out.

               the living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is 
               visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running.

               dorr hisses:

                                     dorr
                         she is in the kitchen. i shall 
                         distract her while you steal out 
                         with the carcass.
