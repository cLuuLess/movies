ceramic elephants.

	elephant.
		(notices a group of street
		urchins)
	hey you guys...! over here! come
	over here and carry elephants!

the street urchins come running. they are ragged,
malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. they are
covered with sores. one of them ~as lost an eye and another
has lost a hand.

	figured you as that kind of guy.

nick dives into a nearby bar.
