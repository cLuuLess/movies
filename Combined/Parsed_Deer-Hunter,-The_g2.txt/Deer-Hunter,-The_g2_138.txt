ext. mountains - mixed hardwood forest - day

snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice
covered trees. there is no horizon. sky and earth are bound
in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the
whispering, fitful, spinning flakes.

nick appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting
snow. nick is moving easily, heading slightly uphill,
following the contour of the slope. as he draws closer we see
that he is following a set of fresh tracks.
