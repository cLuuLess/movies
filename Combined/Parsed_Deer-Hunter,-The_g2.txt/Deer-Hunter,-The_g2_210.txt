ext. rubber plantation - roulette theatre - night

nick appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.
the crowd is going wild, yelling and screaming. nick pushes
through a group of bettors and then stops. a look of stunned
relief spreads over his features.

on the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,
head bowed in acknowledgement of the ovation.

nick grins. he begins yelling and screaming along with
everyone else.

on the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists
in the air and begins hooting maniacally.

... we now see, as does nick, that the tall figure in the
spotlight is not merle at all. it is merle's opponent.
