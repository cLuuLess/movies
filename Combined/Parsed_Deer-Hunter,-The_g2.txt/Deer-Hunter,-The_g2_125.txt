int. supermarket - back room - day

the place is full of crates and boxes. one crew is unloading
a tractor-trailer. another crew is stacking and unpacking.
nick stands with linda and a red-faced, cigar-chewing manager
who is pumping nick's hand, slapping him on the back and
shouting orders all at the same time.

			manager

	here! you did a good job. gimme a
	count on these pears! i think we
	got 'em now, know what i mean? the
	pears, the pears! ask me, we got
	'em right by the balls, know what i

he goes off.

			nick
		(to linda)
	does this... i mean, how does this
	job work out?

			linda 
	oh, it's great. fine.

nick nods. a stock boy comes by and whistles.

			stock boy

		kisses him)

nick nods.

			linda (cont'd)

nick nods again. linda hurries off. the manager comes in from
behind, clapping nick on the shoulder and going for his ear

			manager

	ass. i'm telling you, that's one
	sweet little piece of ass. who's
