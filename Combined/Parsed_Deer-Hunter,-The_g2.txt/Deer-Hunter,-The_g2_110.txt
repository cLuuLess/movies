ext. nick's trailer - winter - dusk

the trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a
plum cake, with tiny american flags. stretching from the
trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge,
hand-lettered banner which says "welcome home nick!" and it
whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.

nick's battered old shark-finned cadillac is in the yard.
alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and people are coming
from all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and
congregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.
