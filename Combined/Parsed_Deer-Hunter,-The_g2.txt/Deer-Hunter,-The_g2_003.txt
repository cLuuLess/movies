int. greek orthodox church - altar - day

a very old priest is making preparations for a wedding
ceremony. sal's mother hovers around him as he unlocks a
cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which
will be used in the service. the priest moves with agonizing
slowness and sal's mother is in the midst of a bad case of
nerves.

			sal's mother 
	it's all ready? everything's ready?

			priest 
	yes.

			sal's mother 
	are you sure everything's ready?
	are you positive?

			priest 
	everything. yes.

			sal's mother 
	it would snow... everything's going
	to slip. everything's going to
	slide... all the cars are going to
	crash!

sal's mother puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into
tears.

			sal's mother (cont'd)
	i can't believe this... my own
	little boy... with a stranger!

the priest smiles. he takes sal's mother in his arms and
comforts her.
