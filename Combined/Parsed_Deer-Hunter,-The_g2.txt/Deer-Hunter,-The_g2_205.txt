ext. rubber plantation - backstage area night

nick comes upon a pile of six naked corpses with their heads
blown off. opposite the corpses -- sitting, standing, pacing,
squatting in the dirt -- are a group of waiting contestants.
some of these are american. most are south vietnamese,
several of whom have come with wives and families. a few of
the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. three. of
the waiting contestants are wearing tuxedos.

suddenly a woman with a baby lets out a shriek. nick spins.
two burly men appear, bringing the corpse of the second
contestant. as the woman with the baby begins sobbing and
screaming with grief the burly men strip the tuxedo off the
second contestant and then, as each article is summarily
removed, they begin dressing one of the waiting contestants
in it.

for a fraction of a second and then smiles.
