ext. clearing in the jungle - the "pits" - day

sal has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to
happen to him. his eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had
mentally transported himself to some distant place. there are
great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and
as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly
like a very small child who has experienced some terrible
confusion.

suddenly the guard standing beside sal wrenches him around.

we see the pit now, close up. there are four bloated corpses
floating in the muck.

we sal's face, close up. he gives a cry and tries to turn
away.

we see the guards pick sal up, screaming. we see the splash
as sal hits the water and then we see him surface between the
bloated corpses, still screaming, paddling desperately and
trying to find something solid to hod him up.
