ext. series of shots - columbine area - dusk

we see the old priest on his way from the church. we see the
older women, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and
cookies, trudging up the hill. we see albert, john and a
bunch of steelworkers, all of them half-bombed, dragging two
cases of beer on a child's sled. we see linda peering out the
trailer window, pale and anxious-looking. we see vince, who
is unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of
every car and screaming, "this is it! this is nick!" and
then, when it isn't, saying, "not yet! just hold your water,
i'll tell you when!"

and we see an empty street into which six vets from the vfw
post come tottering. the vets are all in their old uniforms.
while three of them attempt to make music on a bass drum, a
fife and an old army bugle, the other three attempt to sing.
