int. american embassy - kitchen - night

nick stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table.
on the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a
pile of mushrooms. across from the table six servants with
napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates.

			marine (v.o.) 
	sir?

nick turns. the marine corporal is holding a chef's hat. nick
takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. suddenly a door
comes open and the american ambassador and his wife come in.

			ambassador 
	henri! so good to see you. how are
	you? how are you? darling, this is
	henri. henri, my wife elizabeth.

	omelettes, s'il vous plait.

			wife

			ambassador
	avec champignons.
		(back to his wife)
	fines herbes?

the wife shakes her head. the ambassador winks.

			ambassador (cont'd)
	avec champignons.

the ambassador and his wife hurry out. there is dead silence.
nick pulls the marine corporal to one side, points to his
crotch.

			nick
	pee-pee.
