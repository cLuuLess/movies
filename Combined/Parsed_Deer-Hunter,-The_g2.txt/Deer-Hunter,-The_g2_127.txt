int. john's bar - night

nick comes through the crowd of steelworkers shaking hands.
the steelworkers treat him with immense respect. there are no
cracks; there are no jokes. they squeeze his shoulder, pat
his back, reaching out for him, touching him.

			steelworkers

	did good, boy; you did fine! let
	him through! damn good, boy! let
	him through! he's all right! did
	his part and he did it good! let
	him through! let's make a little
	room!

beer and shots of whiskey.
