int. v.f.w. post - main hall - day

three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. the
tables have been laid with white cloth and the older women
are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a
funeral breakfast. they work in silence, fussing over the
placement of each knife and fork.

as the women work we hear the sound of the choir singing as
the service progresses in the church. at first the sound is
barely audible, easily matched by the faint notes of the vet
with the bugle in the basement below.
but now the sound of the choir grows -- a sound as deep as
water, as dark as night; a sound like stone.

gradually, one by one, the older women stop fussing with the
table. they stand motionless, listening.
