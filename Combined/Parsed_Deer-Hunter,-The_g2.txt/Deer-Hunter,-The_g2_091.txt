ext. bamboo grove - heavy rain - day

merle appears carrying nick on his back. nick is unconscious
and the effort that merle has expended to get him this far
can be measured in merle's eves, which burn like dead coals.
as merle approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the
side of a steep hill, we suddenly see sal, stumbling along
behind and attached to merle by a short rope.

merle comes to a stop, unshoulders nick and lays him on the
ground. as merle stands looking at nick, gasping for breath,
sal hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo
with an expression of pure terror.

			sal 
	where are we going, merle? are we
	going home?

there is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.
merle throws himself on sal, slamming one hand across his
mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence nick.

for a moment there is nothing -- silence. the rain drones on
and we can hear nick's breath, which comes in short, shallow
rasps.

the sound comes again and suddenly a platoon of v.c. soldiers
appear, coming down through the trees. their passage is
almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving
down the hill.

camera closes slowly on merle's face. his gums are bleeding
and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in
his skull. his teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he
looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.
