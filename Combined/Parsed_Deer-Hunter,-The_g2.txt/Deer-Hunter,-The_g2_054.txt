int. cadillac - dawn

everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half
dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and
stuffing them down. hot dog juice has dripped over
everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both
beer and milk are being passed around.

albert tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and
glomps it down.

	it.
