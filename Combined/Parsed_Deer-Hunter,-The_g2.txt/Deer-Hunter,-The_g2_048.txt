int. cadillac night

nick's head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering
wheel. one eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close
to death. suddenly his head snaps up. he slams his foot down
on the brake and the cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to
a jolting stop.

everyone in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out
through the windshield.

there are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them
standing in the headlights.
