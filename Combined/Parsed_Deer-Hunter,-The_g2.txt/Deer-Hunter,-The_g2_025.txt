int. greek orthodox church - night

sal and angela stand facing each other as the priest reads
the holy sacrament of marriage.

			priest 
	"blessed be the kingdom... now and
	forever unto ages and ages...

as the priest continues with the holy sacrament camera picks
up faces in the congregation. we see sal's family. we see
angela's family. we see the vets from the v.f.w. post. we see
the steelworkers from the bar and the wives and mothers who
chased them home to change. they are hard faces -- working
class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the
congregation, a community of both heart and spirit.

camera picks up nick, merle, vince, albert and john standing
in a row opposite the bridesmaids. the guys all look slightly
disheveled. their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes
are soaking wet from walking in the snow.

nick catches linda's eye and they hold each other across the
intervening space like two children who are amazed.

the priest hands white tapers to the bride and groom. camera
closes slowly on the priest. the man is impressive -- gentle
yet full of power. the priest lights the tapers -- first
angela's, then sal's -- and looks out across the assembled
congregation.

			priest 
	"for everyone that does evil hates
	the light, and does not come to the
	light, lest his deeds will be
	reproved."
