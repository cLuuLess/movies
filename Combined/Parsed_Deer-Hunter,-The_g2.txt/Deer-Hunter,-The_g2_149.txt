ext. busted-down old loggers shack - day

albert and john stand with their beers, looking into the
woods. a shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.

the deer comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.
vince appears, reeling. he takes aim at the deer and there is
a dull click. vince jams his pistol back in his holster.

			vince 
	gun! gimme gun!!!

albert indicates his rifle. vince stumbles over to it, rams a
cartridge in the chamber.

			vince (cont'd)
		(looks around, bewildered)
	where's it gone?

			john 
	inside, vince.

vince staggers to the cabin door. the deer is lying on the
floor, motionless, dead.

			vince 
	i got it! hey, you guys, i got
	it!!!
