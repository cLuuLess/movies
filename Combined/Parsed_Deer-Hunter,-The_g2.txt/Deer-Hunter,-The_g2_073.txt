ext. grass huts after napalm attack - day

merle stands alone with his b.a.r. surrounded by clouds of
billowing black smoke. there is no sound but the rush of
heated air and the faint crackle of flames. merle's clothes
are burning. flames are licking up his trouser legs and a
blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.

in front of merle the soldiers and the villagers lie in two
charred heaps. the babies lie between them. both are
motionless now, like two roasted stones.

an american lieutenant steps out from behind one of the
burning huts. merle and the lieutenant spin on each other and
then the lieutenant lowers his carbine.

			lieutenant
	what the hell are you doing here?

			merle 
		(numb)
	saving lives.

more americans appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the
trees in a long line. among them are nick and sal.

			lieutenant
	move it out, girls! move it out!

the lieutenant heads down the line. nick stares at merle.

			nick
	merle?... jesus, merle!

merle turns and looks at nick. there is no recognition. he
seems to be looking right through him.

sal comes up behind nick.

			sal
	hey...! hey, merle!

a shot rings out. the lieutenant goes down and suddenly the
whole line of americans is caught in a murderous cross-fire.
grenades rain out of the trees. merle, nick and sal dive for
cover.

out of the smoke v.c. soldiers begin to appear, more and more
of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.
