int. american embassy - corridor off kitchen - night

nick comes down the corridor behind the marine corporal. as
he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he
picks it up and swings it down on the marine corporal's head.
the blow is ferocious. the chair splinters into pieces and
the marine corporal goes down with a dull thud.

nick stands for a moment, looking at him. then he kneels,
removes his pistol and jams it in his belt.
