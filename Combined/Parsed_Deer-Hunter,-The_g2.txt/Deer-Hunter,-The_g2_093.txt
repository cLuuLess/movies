ext. cratered roadside - burning car - night

merle has dragged sal from the car and thrown him in the
ditch below nick. sal is horribly burned and merle kneels
over him -- out of breath, tears streaming from his cavernous
eyes -- howling with helpless rage.

			merle
	damn it!!! god damn it!!!

merle looks down at sal. sal's face in a mass of raw flesh
but his eyes look up at merle with lunatic, unwavering trust.

			merle (cont'd)
	sal!
		(more gently)
	sal... goddamn it, sal, don't you
	know anything?

			sal
	where are we going, merle? are we
	going home?

			merle
		(nods)
	sure. sure, sal. we're going home.
