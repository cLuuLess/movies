int. nick's trailer - night

linda is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across
the pillows, like a dancer leaping.

nick stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking
down at her. after a moment he draws the covers over her,
fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then
goes to the window.
