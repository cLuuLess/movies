	this suitcase here?

			sal 
	where?

			nick 
	here. behind you.

nick pulls a suitcase off the rack behind sal's chair.

			sal 
	i don't know.

nick sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the
clasps.

			nick
	maybe angela brought you stuff. i
	know she said --

the suitcase slips over the back of the wall.

			nick (cont'd)
	shit!

nick swings up on the wall and then he freezes. the lid of
the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are
scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.

			sal 
	mom keeps sending me socks, nick. i
	mean, if it's socks or something
	just let 'em go.
