ext. columbine street - day

nick and linda are some distance away. nick is shaking hands
with an enthusiastic man while linda stands to one side,
watching his face, and so full of love that she seems about
to burst. another man comes over. linda takes the man's arm
and presents him to nick.

we cannot hear what is being said. the only sound comes from
the mill which looms up behind them out the frozen valley
below.
