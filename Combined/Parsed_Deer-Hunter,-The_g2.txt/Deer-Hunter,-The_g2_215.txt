ext. cemetery - grave site - day

the priest completes his reading of the 23rd psalm. the
mourners join in the lord's prayer.

camera closes on nick, vince, albert, john and sal. they help
sal to the side of the grave. it is awkward. the chair gets
stuck and they have to carry it. they all pick up a handful
of dirt and then, following nick's lead, they throw it in.

nick steps back from the grave, nods to the vets. the vets
come to attention. the vet with the bugle steps forward and
tremblingly, but perfectly, plays taps.
