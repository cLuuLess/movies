ext. dusty road - day

a platoon of americans have been ambushed on the road. the
bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts
spilled in the dirt. no one moves and there is absolute
silence except for the low buzz of flies.

a v.c. lieutenant steps into sight. he gives a brusque
command and v.c. soldiers step out of the jungle. the
lieutenant bayonets a few of the fallen u.s. soldiers --
idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he
rubs his finger in the americans' blood. the v.c. soldiers
laugh, spear a few americans themselves and repeat the joke.

there is a slight sound. the v.c. lieutenant spins and gives
a low command. fifty feet away there are three grass huts.
he signals his soldiers to spread out and then he starts
toward them.
