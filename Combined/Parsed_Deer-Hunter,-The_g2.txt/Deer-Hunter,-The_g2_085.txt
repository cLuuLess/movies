ext. clearing in the jungle - heavy rain - day

as the prisoners emerge from the "tiger cage" the guards
smash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. in the
melee sal is separated from nick and merle, both of whom are
knocked to the ground by furious blows. when they get to
their feet they see that sal is wandering off alone in the
direction of the "pits". one of the guards spots sal and
clubs him down.

sal gets up and begins wandering off again. the guard clubs
him down again, turns to the guard in charge and begins
complaining. the guard in charge dispatches a second guard to
help the first and the two guards open the bamboo grating on
one of the "pits".

merle turns to nick, who is standing beside him.

			merle 
	it's up to you, nick. now it's up
	to you.
