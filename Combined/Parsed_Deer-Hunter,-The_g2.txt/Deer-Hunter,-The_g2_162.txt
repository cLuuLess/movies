two or three checkers are closing out the registers up front.

			nick 
	oh. fine.

			checker

			nick

			checker 
	too bad.

nick goes down a long aisle of bright packages. coming out at
the back he finds linda sitting in a green plastic chair,
crying.

			nick 
	linda... honey, what's wrong?

			linda
		(helpless shrug)
	i don't know.

			nick 
	hey. look. there must be something.

linda looks at him, tears streaming down her face.

			linda 
	i'm just so lonely.

			nick 
	c'mon. i've got the car.

			linda 
		(shakes her head)
	i'll be out... just leave me. i'll
	be out. i'm fine. really. i'm fine.

nick walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.
