ext. yard behind shuttered building - night

the yard is grown over. as nick goes in there comes a low
buzz of flies. he trips over something, draws back. seeing a
candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses
and lights it.

the yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet
cushions and rotting corpses. nick leans over one of the
corpses. the skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe
with maggots.

nick straightens, looks around.

			nick 
	merle!!!

the back door to the building is open. nick draws his pistol
and goes in.
