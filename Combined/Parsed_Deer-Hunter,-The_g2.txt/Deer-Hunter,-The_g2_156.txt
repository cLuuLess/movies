int. v.a. hospital - corridor off recreation room - night

in the foreground a nurse holds a telephone. beyond the nurse
we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down
the polished corridor. as the figure draws closer we realize
it is sal. sal is dressed in a white hospital gown, the
bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and
trails limply on the floor. both sal's legs have been
amputated and he has lost one arm. his face is terribly
scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his
eyes.

sal takes the telephone. the soundtrack from the movie in the
recreation room is very loud.

			sal
	hello?
