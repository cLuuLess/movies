int. pizza parlor - table by window - day

nick and linda sit opposite one another. across the street a
coal train is rumbling slowly by and nick is watching it. the
cars are black, interchangable, and they roll on and on.
suddenly the last car appears. the car passes and there is
silence.

linda gives nick a smile.

			nick 
	it was all for nothing. do you know
	that? it was all for nothing.

linda stares at him. she doesn't know what to say, how to
respond. nick forces a grin, gestures with his hand and
shrugs. he picks up the check, stands.

			linda 
	nick?... i just want to say how
	sorry i am about sal and about
	merle. how... i know you loved them
	and i know it's not the same. i
	mean now.

			nick
	naw, it's... i mean...

			linda 
	maybe... i don't know, if you want
	to talk --

			nick 
	naw, it's... this guy wants his
	money.
