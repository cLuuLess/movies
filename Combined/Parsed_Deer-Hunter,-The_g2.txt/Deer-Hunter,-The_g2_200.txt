ext. rubber plantation - saigon outskirts night

an elegant house of french design is ablaze with lights. the
house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have
been set up. over the terrace and strung out for a hundred
yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns
which bob and sway in the wind. guests are everywhere --
wandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and
strolling under the trees. for the most part the guests are
americans and south vietnamese. the majority of these are
officers in uniform, but there are numerous civilians mixed
among them and the civilians are attired in everything from
sports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. as to
nationality there are no limits. there are french, germans,
belgians, swiss, chinese, british and australians. whores and
mistresses abound. wives are not greatly in evidence, except
to dog the heels of heavily armed arvn guards who wander
about, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.
