int. v.f.w. post - basement - day

pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of
leaking steam. seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their
uniforms are five old vets. two vets are on the nod. the
other three -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient
attention to the sixth vet who stands beside the boiler with
a bugle, trying to play taps.

			vet 1 
	up a little there... what would you
	say?

			vet 2 
	up.

the vet with the bugle tries it again, flubs it, starts
over...
