int. v.f.w. post - day

the place is large and drafty and rundown. a huge american
flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. under it women are
laying white table cloths on trestle tables. off to one side
a half dozen old men wearing vfw hats are scotch-taping paper
ribbons to the brick wall. two old men are on stepladders,
two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under
the direction of a pair of world war i vets standing side by
side. their hands tremble. their four eyes loom huge behind
corrective lenses.

			vet 1 
	up i would say... what would you
	say?

			vet 2 
	up.

			vet 1

	up ribbon!

one end of the ribbon is moved up. the two vets study it.

			vet 2 
	down i would say... what would you
	say?

			vet 1 
	down.

	down ribbon!

suddenly there is a commotion. the women who are setting up
the tables all rush to the door as the older women come in
with the wedding cake. the older women look half-frozen and
as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus
of uhh's and ahh's. suddenly one of the older women
collapses. friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and
give her wine. the woman takes the glass, tosses it off in
one swallow and grins. everyone laughs.
