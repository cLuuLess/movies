because his girl, marsha, is dancing too close to fred.

vince marches up and taps fred on the shoulder. fred releases
marsha. marsha waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of
them exchange words. vince turns marsha, points to her ass.
fred turns marsha, pints to the small of her back. vince is
hopping up and down now. so is fred. marsha, who is getting
bored, points to the door. vince and fred bang out. as soon
as they have gone marsha is taken by someone else who puts
his hand right back where fred had it.
