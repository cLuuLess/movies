int. out-patient room - u.s. military hospital - day

nick turns away from the window and sits down in the chair.
suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed doctor comes in.

			doctor
	is your name solomon?

nick shakes his head.

			doctor (cont'd)
	are you sure?

nick nods.

			doctor (cont'd)
	lemme see this.

the doctor looks at the paper marker on nick's neck.

			doctor (cont'd)
	is this yours?

nick nods.

			doctor (cont'd)
	this isn't yours. this can't be
	yours! i'm going to take this one
	off and cut it up...
		(he extracts a pair of
		scissors and does so)
	shred it... so no one gets a hold
	of it. what i'm going to do now,
	i'm going to give you this one.
		(he staples a new marker
		around nick's neck)
	there. how's that? does that feel
	better?

nick nods. the doctor directs a finger at him.

			doctor (cont'd)
	that one's yours.

the doctor slams back out the door. another jet thunders
overhead. the hydraulic lifters on the loading ramp shriek
and whine...

nick reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers
down at it from the corner of his eye. it seems to remind him
of something and he takes out his wallet. in his wallet is a
photograph of linda. nick peers at the photograph intently,
then closes his wallet and puts it away.
