int. pontiac - night

sal looks over at angela.

			sal
	all set, hon?

angela nods. sal puts the car into gear and starts slowly
off. fists pound on the car. rice and streamers shower down.
suddenly, through the front windshield, merle appears, stark
naked, running in front of the car with colored paper
streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. for a
split second sal cannot believe what he is seeing. he throws
a look at angela. angela covers her mouth in amazement and
then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes.
