ext. mountains - frozen lake - day

the wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way
and then the other. nick appears in the distance, a black
speck in the endless expanse of shifting white.

as nick draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. his
clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow
gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. as nick
approaches camera he falters and limps to a stop. there are
no tracks. there is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in
the driving snow.

the wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in
again from another way. suddenly it stops entirely. in the
silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.

nick turns. the buck is standing on the shoreline, not thirty
feet away, looking down at him.

nick pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights
down the barrel.

we see the buck through nick's sights. it is a clear shot.
nick's finger is on the trigger. he has only to squeeze it.

nick lowers his rifle. the buck snorts, tosses his horns and
disappears in the slanting snow.

nick stands motionless, staring after it, so wonder-struck he
has forgotten to breathe.
