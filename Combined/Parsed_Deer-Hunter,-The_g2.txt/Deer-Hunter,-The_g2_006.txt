ext. steel mill - parking lot - day

the snow is still falling. it covers the ground. it covers
the acres of parked cars. it swirls and tosses and blows. as
the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all
stop dead in their tracks.

			vince 
	snow... holy shit, snow!

sal gives a look at the others. something is going on. vince
is so excited he begins hopping around.

			vince (cont'd)
	 ... do you know what this means?
	do you guys realize exactly what
	this means?

they all know. they all know damn well. merle and nick
exchange looks. albert chortles.

			sal 
	what are you guys...? are you guys
	going hunting?

the others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. they are all a
little embarrassed.

			sal (cont'd)
	not tonight?... you're not driving
	up tonight?

			nick 
	as soon as you're hitched, sal.
	first we get you hitched.

			sal 
		(envious)
	you guys are crazy. you know that?
	i mean you guys are really nuts.

			vince

	nuts!

			nick

	right. we'll be right here, right
	with you.

			merle 
	right.

			albert 
	damn right!

			vince 
	what do you think, sal? jesus, you
	think we'd miss this?

now sal is embarrassed. he makes a gesture with his hand.

			nick 
		(with a laugh)
	c'mon. c'mon you guys!

they all start into the swirling snow. nick with an arm
around sal.

			vince

	any help you might need--
