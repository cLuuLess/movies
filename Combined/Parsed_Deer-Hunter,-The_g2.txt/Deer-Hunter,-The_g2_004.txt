ext. columbine street - day

another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides
back. as the car disappears, the door to one of the houses
bursts open and a group of giggling bridesmaids begin
scampering across the street. they have all been working on
their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they
all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. as
they make their way to the other side of the street they all
wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. one
of the bridesmaids loses her dress entirely and with everyone
laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. when the
garment is repossessed a door comes open and the bridesmaids
disappear inside.

camera holds on columbine street. the snow slants across the
little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little
houses. another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides
back. suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group
of older women emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a
miniature bride and groom standing on the top. the women are
all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.
they begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,
with the great white cake held firmly between them.
