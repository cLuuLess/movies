int. v.f.w. post - dance floor - night

the band is going full blast and the whirling couples, young
and old, are laughing.
we see sal and angela, nick and linda, vince, albert and
john. the only one of the group not dancing is merle. merle
is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging
beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps. we sense immediately that he
feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the
spirit of the party. merle finishes the beer, crumples the
can and starts on another. as he picks up the second can he
notices that a sad-looking girl is sitting against the wall
behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance. the sad
looking girl gives merle a smile. merle pretends not to see
and moves behind a post.
