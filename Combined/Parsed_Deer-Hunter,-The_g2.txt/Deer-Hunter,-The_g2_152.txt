int. busted-down old loggers shack - night

the coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the
wind. nick is propped against the wall, dozing. john is out
cold. albert and vince are both drunk and arguing bitterly.

			albert 
	you're full of shit, vince! you're
	so full of shit you're going to
	float away!

			vince 
	who? who is?

			albert 
	you, vince! you! you are! you're a
	crock! you're a walking, talking
	crock!... i mean, what do you know?

			vince 
	i know! i fuckin' know!

			albert 
	you don't!

			vince 
	i do!!!

			albert 
	i'm tellin' you she does it, vince!
	with twenty guys you know!

			vince 
	she does not!

			albert 
	then what's the gun for! what's
	this for?

			vince 
	in case!!! the gun's in case!!!

			albert 
	in case???!!! in case of what? in
	case you stumble on her, suckin'
	cock in the front fucking hall?!

			vince 
	she might!!! she might do it,
	albert, but you can't fuckin' tell
	me that she does!!!

			albert 
	she does, vince! that's what i'm
	telling you! she does!!!

vince is sheet-white, trembling. he grabs up the pistol and
cocks it.

			vince
		(shrieking)
	say that one more time!... say
	it!!! go on, say it!!!

nick is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at
the pistol in disbelief. suddenly he springs, seizes the gun
with one hand and slams vince to the floor. vince gets up.
nick slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and
begins pounding his head against the wall. albert lurches
over, pulls nick away.

			albert 
	nick! nick, you'll kill him!...
	easy. nick, easy! hey, hey. vince
	goes back a long way.

			nick
		(grimly)
	yeah.

vince gets to his feet. blood is streaming down his face.

			vince 
	what the hell was that!
		(picks up the pistol)
	what did you think? did you think
	it was loaded!

			nick 
	you loaded it, vince! i saw you!

			vince 
	the fuck i did!!!

			nick 
	the fuck you didn't!... gimme that!

nick takes the pistol.

			vince 
	what do you think? you think i
	don't know!!!

nick looks at him, then he empties the pistol into the floor.

for a moment there is absolute silence. the wind moans in the
trees, snow curls through the open door and john, who is
still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore.

nick looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...

			nick 
	i'm going to throw this fuckin'
	thing away.

nick goes out.
