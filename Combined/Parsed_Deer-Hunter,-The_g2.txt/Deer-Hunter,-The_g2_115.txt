int. motel - nick's unit - dusk

nick stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. his
duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled
along the wall by his feet. his head is thrown back and he is
draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw
swallows. .

nick lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it
again. this time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is
gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like
that of an animal run to the ground.

nick crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands
and looks out.
