int. motel - nick's unit - bedroom - night

as linda comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she
stops dead in her tracks.

nick is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe
off and sound asleep.

			linda 
	nick?

nick doesn't stir, doesn't budge. linda crosses and looks at
him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a
wistful shake.

			linda (cont'd)
	nick...? nick, it's me!

but nick is out, gone. linda lets out a little moan and sits
down on the chair beside the bed. then, almost immediately,
she stands and begins taking off his clothes. she takes off
his shoes, then both socks. as she goes to undo his belt, his
shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a
fresh scar. linda stares at the scar for a moment, then she
slowly exposes the whole of nick's chest.

nick's chest is covered with a series of terrifying fresh
scars. the scars are raised; they are inter-connected and
studded with angry suture marks, like a topographical map of
some unknown battleground.

camera holds on linda's face.
