ext. roadside area - dawn - later

shots are ringing out in the hills. nick, albert and john
stand by the roadside while vince and merle glare at each
other. vince is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing
his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down
vest that could only have come from albert. merle's knapsack
lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it
contains a pair of vibram-soled mountain boots.

			merle 
	sure i got boots. i got boots right
	here.

			vince 
	then lemme have 'em.

			merle 
	no.

			vince 
		(both hands in the air)
	no!!!?

			merle 
	no.

			vince 
	what do you mean, no???

			merle
	that's it. no. no way.

			vince 
	some fuckin' friend... you're some
	fuckin' friend, merle!

			merle 
	you gotta learn, vince! you come
	out here... you got no jacket, you
	got no pants, you got no knife and
	you got no boots. you think
	everyone's gonna take care of you!
	that's what you always think, but
	this time you're wrong. this time
	you're on your own!

			albert
	merle, give him the boots.

			merle
	no. no boots. no nothin'.

			vince 
	you're one fuckin' bastard, merle.
	you know that? you're one fucking
	bastard!

			merle 
		(snapping it out, jabbing
		his finger at the ground)
	this is this, vince. this isn't
	something else. this is this!

			vince 
	you know what i think? there's
	times i think you're a goddamn
	faggot!... i fixed you up a million
	times, merle!
		(to the others)
	i fixed him up a million times! i
	don't know how many times i fixed
	him up... and nothin' ever
	happens... zilch! zero!... the
	trouble with you, merle, no one
	knows what you're talking about!
	"this is this"? what does that
	mean, "this is this"? i mean is
	that some faggot bullshit, or is
	that some faggot bullshit!!! and if
	it isn't, what the hell is it???

			john
	vince. hey, you guys --

			vince
		(hopping now)
	take last night...! last night he
	coulda had twenty fuckin' deer!
	more! he coulda had more! and look
	what he does! i mean look what he
	fuckin' does!!!

			john 
	vince!!!

john throws up his hands in a comical way.

			john (cont'd)
	i'll get the boots.

			albert
		(in agreement)
	get the boots.

			john
		(crossing to merle's
		knapsack)
	i mean let's get going before --

merle -- who has remained completely calm throughout vince's
tirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. john
freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.

			merle
	i said no.

john looks at albert, who is right behind him, and they both
back away. vince, who is standing directly opposite merle,
begins to tremble. his mouth comes open, closes and comes
open again. urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his
pants leg, staining the snow. suddenly, nick steps forward.
he looks at merle, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the
boots, walks over to vince and throws them on the road.

			nick
		(gently, to merle)
	let's hunt.
