int. corridor - bar - night

the bar girl comes around the corner with nick, guiding him
to a flight of narrow stairs. she has one hand around his
waist and the other down the front of his pants.

			bar girl
	you like to call me linda now?

			nick 
	linda, yeah.

			bar girl 
	you call me linda, just like home.

suddenly nick draws to a stop, staring at a small window at
the end of the corridor. he tears himself loose from the bar
girl and pushes up against the glass.
