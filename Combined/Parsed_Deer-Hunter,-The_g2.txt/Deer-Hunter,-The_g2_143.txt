ext. mountains - deadfall - day

nick reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs
over. as he touches down on the other side there is a
growling sound.

nick grabs for the deadfall. the wind shifts and we see that
he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the
top of a steep scree slope. as nick watches, the boulder
begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and
boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...
and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to
unknown depths below.
