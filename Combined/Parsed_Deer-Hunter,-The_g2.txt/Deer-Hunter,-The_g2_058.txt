ext. thruway pittsburgh off-ramp - twilight

traffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of
headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems
to float in thin air. behind is the mill, belching steam and
ablaze with fire.

nick's cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the
traffic. the car sits low. trussed to the hood, to the roof,
to the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer. rope-ends
flutter and bang in the wind. the car shudders and thuds.
inside, grinning maniacally, nick, merle, vince, albert and
john are all shouting and guzzling beer.
