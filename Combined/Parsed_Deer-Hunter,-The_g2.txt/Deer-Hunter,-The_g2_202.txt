ext. rubber plantation - clearing in trees - night

a dozen arvn helicopters have put down between the trees. one
has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.

there is a mounting clatter in the distance and another
helicopter comes out of the sky. as it sets down a dashingly
handsome air force officer hops out and extends a hand to his
wife. when his wife has descended the officer opens a back
compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their
baby. he hands the baby to his wife and they stroll off
toward the house.
