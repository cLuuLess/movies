ext. saigon airport - terminal building - night

viet cong sappers have just attacked. a number of jet
fighters are burning, bodies are strewn over the tarmac and
jeeps with soldiers are racing back and forth.
out beyond, the jet transport taxis into view, lumbering like
a great silver monster out of the night.
