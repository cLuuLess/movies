int. linda's house - kitchen - day

linda is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly
lovely face. wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone
in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. thumping noises are
coming from the room above. the thumping gets louder.
there is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were
being thrown around. a man's voice begins cursing and there
is more thumping and crashing. suddenly there is a thud...
and then silence.

linda bites her lip. she crosses to the stove, ladles stew
into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it
all on a tray.
