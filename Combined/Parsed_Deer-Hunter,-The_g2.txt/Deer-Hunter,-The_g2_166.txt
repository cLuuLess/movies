ext. street in front of nick's trailer (nick's pov) - night

the wind is blowing. bits of trash skitter and swirl in the
frozen ruts and a cat comes by, meowing. suddenly a man
appears walking slowly down the street. the man is elegantly
dressed in western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,
polished boots and a stetson hat. as the man draws under the
light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at nick's trailer.

the man is merle, or if not merle it is a face so strikingly
similar that nick almost lets out a cry.

the man under the street lamp pauses, just for an instant,
then he turns and moves on down the street.
