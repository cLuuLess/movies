ext. narrow street after rocket explosion - night

a nearby building is burning fiercely. the street is deserted
except for the sprawled corpses of the street urchins which
lie this way and that, like broken dolls.

nick walks out past the corpses. the street is littered with
fragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like
chunks of snow.
