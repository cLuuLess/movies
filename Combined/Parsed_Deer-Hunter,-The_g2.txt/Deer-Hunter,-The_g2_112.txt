int. taxicab - dusk

nick sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by
unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has
bought for linda. nick looks nervous, very nervous.

suddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the
trailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with vince hopping
up and down in the snow and the old vets all marking time
under the flapping banner.
