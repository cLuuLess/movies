int. thatched hut - prisoner end - day

there are no americans left to play except sal. the sobbing
has stopped but sal is shaking and trembling and his eyes
wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.
merle, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to
sal. as he does so we hear the clicks coming from across the
room and the excited murmurs of the guards as their betting
choice survives another round.

			merle 
	you can do it, sal.

			sal 
	no. no, no.

			merle 
	sal... listen to me, sal! you have
	to do it.

			sal
	i want to go home, merle.

			merle 
	you have to think about this, sal.
	listen to me, sal! you have to
	think about this.

			sal 
		(tears again)
	this is horrible!

			merle 
	listen to me, sal. if you don't do
	it they'll put you in the pit. if
	they put you in the pit, sal,
	you're gonna die... sal, do you
	understand?

			sal 
		(nods)
	merle, i wanna go home!

there is an explosion from the other end of the room. sal's
eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering scream. the guards
open a path and nick appears. his knees won't support him and
the guard who is holding him throws him on the floor.

			merle 
	listen to me, sal. do it! you have
	to do it!

the guard who delivered nick jerks sal to his feet and drags
him of f to the table.
