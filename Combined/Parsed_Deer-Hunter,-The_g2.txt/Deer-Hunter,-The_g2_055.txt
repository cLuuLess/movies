ext. roadside area - dawn

the sky is just turning grey. a cold wind is blowing, moaning
in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open
roadway. the guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos.

			vince
	this is it. definitely. this is it,
	but they changed it.

			albert 
	you're full of shit.

			vince 
	who's full of shit?

			albert 
	you're full of shit!

			vince 
	i'm telling you, they changed it!

			albert 
	they did not!

			vince 
	they did too!

			albert 
	jesus, it's freezing!

nick, merle and john have the trunk open and are taking stuff
out. merle strips down where he stands and begins putting on
his hunting clothes. albert and vince grab their things and
follow the example of nick and john, who are changing on the
corner of the seats.

			nick 
	whee-uu!

			albert 
	jesus!

			john 
	holy shit!

			vince 
	merle, hey merle, you got any
	socks?

merle, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks
over.

			vince (cont'd)
		(rummaging around in the
		mess of things he has
		brought)
	never mind, merle. never mind, i
	got 'em... where the hell are my
	pants? anyone see my pants?... who
	the hell took my pants!

vince begins plunging around.

			others 
	fuckhead! watch it!

			vince 
	somebody took my pants... i know i
	brought pants.

vince tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with
nothing and steps out of the car.

			vince (cont'd)
	all right. all right, you guys.
	whoever took my pants, i want 'em
	back!
