ext. v.f.w. post - street - night

john, albert, merle and vincent are standing by the door.
their tuxedos are stained and torn. their carnations are
squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing
entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts.
vince looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg
torn away, and they are all guzzling beer.
