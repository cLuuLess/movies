int. v.f.w. post - night

the guests have formed in a long double line which extends
from the dance floor right out into the street. everyone is
pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags
of rice. as sal and angela appear from out of a back room
there is a great rowdy cheer. the musicians strike up a
march. followed by the musicians, showered with streamers,
rice, advice and encouragement, sal and angela walk the
gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red
pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a
series of ear-splitting crescendos.
