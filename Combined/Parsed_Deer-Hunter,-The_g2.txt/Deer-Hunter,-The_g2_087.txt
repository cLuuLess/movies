ext. clearing in the jungle - waiting prisoners - day

nick stands motionless, stunned, listening to sal's screams.
merle has his attention focused on the guard in charge and
when he glances in their direction merle slugs nick in the
stomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. nick
struggles to his feet. merle attacks him again and now, as
the guard in charge comes over to see what's going on, merle
begins hopping up and down, pointing at nick, pointing at the
revolver in the guard's hand and screaming.

			merle
	him and me!!! him and me!!!

the guards look at each other, interested.

			merle (cont'd)
	him and me, goddamn it! him and me!
