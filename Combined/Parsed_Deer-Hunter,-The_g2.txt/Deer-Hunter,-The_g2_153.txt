ext. busted-down old loggers shack - night

for a moment nick stands in the light from the door,
listening to the wind. he looks down at the pistol again,
then he heaves it into the trees.

the wind gusts. the snow swirls and hisses, slipping through
the woods in great streaming wraiths.

nick watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.
