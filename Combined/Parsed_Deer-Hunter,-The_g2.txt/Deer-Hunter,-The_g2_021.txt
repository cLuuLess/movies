ext. nick's trailer - day

the trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which
looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a
construction site. it stands on cinder blocks in a small lot
which has been cut out of the side of the hill. a wrecked
school bus decorates it to the right. on the left is a bare
branched tree. nick's black cadillac is parked in front and a
light shows from inside the trailer.

camera picks up merle who is strolling toward the trailer
whistling through his teeth. he is wearing his tuxedo and
carries a knapsack and a deer rifle. he mounts the cinder
block steps and pounds on the trailer door. nick opens the
door and waves him in.
