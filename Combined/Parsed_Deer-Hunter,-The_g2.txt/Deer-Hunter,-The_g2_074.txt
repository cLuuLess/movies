ext. clearing in the jungle - heavy rain - day

we are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug
and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by
stones. the ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits
are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo
gratings. in each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --
south vietnamese and american. their hands grip the gratings
and their eyes are hollow. other than an occasional groan
there is only the sound of the falling rain.

a v.c. soldier trudges out of the jungle. as he reaches the
pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and
down on the bamboo gratings. the hands disappear. as soon as
one comes back, the soldier stomps on it, shrieking with
laughter. then, almost as an afterthought, the soldier pulls
down his pants and squats above the center grating.

camera tilts slowly upward. we see the clearing in its
totality. it is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and
contains only two structures. one is a large bamboo "tiger
cage" with a few leaves tied to its top. the other is a small
hut with a thatched roof. the walls of the hut are open and
we can see v.c. guards moving about inside.

a cry comes from the hut. there is the thud of a rifle butt
on flesh and the cry abruptly stops.
