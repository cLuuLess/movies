int. sal's house - front parlor - night

the room is very dark. angela sits at a lace-covered table by
the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie
glow. angela holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny
one, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to
another.

there is a sound from the hallway, then sal's mother comes in
with nick.

			sal's mother 
	i know i know you. so familiar.
	such a familiar face. oh, i know
	now! the toaster man! i'll go and
	get it for you.

sal's mother goes out. angela lights up a cigarette.

			angela 
	you're back.

			nick 
	yeah.

			angela 
	i'm glad. seriously... i'm very
	glad.

			nick 
	angela, i just heard sal was alive.

			angela 
	sure. why not.

			nick 
	where? where is he?

			angela 
	nick, he's fine. he's in a hospital
	and they're fixing him up.

			nick 
	you talk to him?

			angela 
	oh, sure... twice a day.

			nick 
	what hospital is he in? where?

			angela 
	nick... sal is very weak. he
	suffered a severe wound... and
	right now he doesn't want a whole
	lot of people to get involved in a
	whole thing.

			nick 
	hey, angela, sal and i go back a
	long way.

			angela 
	he doesn't want people bugging him,
	nick!

angela begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands
up.

she stares at nick for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and
writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. nick
comes up behind her. angela finishes, puts down the pen and
stands with her back against the wall. nick tears off the
piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.

			nick 
	angela...?

angela laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding
nick's eyes.

			angela 
	did you ever think life would turn
	out like this?

			nick 
	no.

			angela 
	you know what sal's got now?...
	sal's got... one arm, nick, and...
	that's it.

the door to the kitchen bangs open and sal's mother comes in
with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.

			sal's mother 
	here. this is it. what you do, you
	stick this in here.

pushes the toaster in nick's arms.

			sal's mother (cont'd)
	then you jab it, see. jab it good.
	something's in it. hear? listen.
	something's in it. what? what's
	there?
