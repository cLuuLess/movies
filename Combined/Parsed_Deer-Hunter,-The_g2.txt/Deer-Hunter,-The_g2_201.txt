ext. rubber plantation - parking area - night

jeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked
side by side with gleaming mercedes limousines, staff cars
from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian
vehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.

more vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like
plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.
