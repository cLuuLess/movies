ext. paulÂ’s street. night

paul turns onto his street. the houses are dark: windows shuttered;
gates closed; not a soul about. paul stops before his gate. honks
twice. the gate doesn't open. he hops out and opens it with a key.

gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. he hears the
far off sound of gunfire. distant explosions light the night sky.
