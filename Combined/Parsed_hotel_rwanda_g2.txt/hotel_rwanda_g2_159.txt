int. truck day

paul clambers on beside him. he reaches tatiana as benedict sits
beside her.

                        paul
            i have to stay.

                        tatiana
            no! sit down now.

                        paul
            i cannot leave these people. i will wait
            for the twins.

paul backs off. tatiana tries to follow. benedict grabs her.

                        tatiana
            let go. let me off this truck.

a commotion as she tries to get up.

                        tatiana (cont'd)
            let me go. children get off.

                        paul
