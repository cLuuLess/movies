int. sabena president's office. brussels. night

several executive officers sit across from sabena president godefroid
around a speaker phone.

                        sabena president
            can i have your name again?

                        paul (o.s.)
            paul rusesabagina, mr. godefroid. the
            house manager. i met you on your last
            visit.

                        sabena president
            yes, paul, i remember. the mille collines
            is a very important property for sabena.
            our directors believe we should close
            down, shutter the place until this unrest
            is over?

this is really bad news. paul can't allow them to close.

                        paul
            sir, that would be very bad for our
            reputation. we are an oasis of calm for
            all our loyal customers. what would they
            think if sabena deserted them now? (lies)
            i assure you the united nations has
            everything under control.

on the sabena president

he looks at the others.

                        sabena president
            very well. but if this thing gets worse,
            we must close. if there's anything you
            need, call anytime.

                        paul
            there is one thing i need right away.
