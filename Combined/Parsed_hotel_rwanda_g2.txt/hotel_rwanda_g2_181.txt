ext. hotel forecourt. night

colonel oliver arrives in his armored truck. paul, odette, benedict and
others gather around him.

                        paul
            they fired a rocket at us.

                        colonel oliver
            yes. where are the rwandan police?

                        paul
            i ran out of bribes. bizimungu took them
            away.

                        colonel oliver
            that explains it. i'm sorry to tell you
            this but we've heard rumors the militia
            are getting ready to storm the hotel.

                        paul
            will you protect us.

                        colonel oliver
            i can't, i don't have the men.

                        various voices
            we have no one...we will be killed.

                        colonel oliver
            there's one option.

                        paul
            what is it?

                        colonel oliver
            the rebels have fought their way into the
            city. they have many hutu prisoners.

they're willing to exchange them for you
all.

                        odette
            will the hutu army agree?

                        colonel oliver
            i think so. they are in disarray now. the
            rebels are winning, and the hutu high
            command are anxious to get some of their
            men back.

                        tutsi woman
            how would we escape?

                        colonel oliver
            by convoy.

                        xavier
            this time the militia will kill us.

                        paul
            they will surely kill us here. it's over
            here. we have to take the chance.

                        tutsi woman
            no, we'll be chopped on the street.

                        paul
            we'll be chopped here.

the crowd disperses. colonel oliver takes paul aside.

                        colonel oliver
            a man came to my headquarters, asked that
            i give you this.

colonel oliver hands a letter.

                        colonel oliver (cont'd)
            paul, i need you to buy me a day or two.
            i don't have the fuel for this convoy. i
            will have to scrounge it.

                        paul
            i can't. i have nothing left to bribe
            with. can your men at the gate hold out
            for another day?

                        colonel oliver
            no, paul, they're afraid. they've
            demanded to be moved back to headquarters
            now.

                        paul
            give me their uniforms. i will put people
            at the gate, in disguise.

                        colonel oliver
            i wish i could, paul. try to hold out.

one more day.

colonel oliver leaves. their is nothing more paul can do.
