int. hotel lobby. day

paul leads zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful
blend of africa and europe. guests stare as water sloshes and spills
from the crate.

gregoire, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look
of disapproval. paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him.

                        paul
                 (re: spilled water)
            gregoire. take care of this.

gregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores paul.

                        paul (cont'd)
            gregoire! see to this right away.

the elevator door opens and reveals bik the belgian hotel manager, mid-
40's, reading some reports. he looks up, sees paul and zozo carrying
the box as they step in. bik looks puzzled.

                        paul (cont'd)
            it's an emergency, sir.

now bik sees the wet floor.

                        bik
            paul!

                        paul
            gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.

the elevator doors shut. bik's left standing in disbelief.
