            i managed to get the president of france
            on the phone.

                        paul (o.s.)
            thank you, sir, you saved our lives.

                        sabena president
            paul, i pleaded with the president to go
            in and get you all. he told me it will
            not happen.

                        paul
            why?

                        sabena president
            i can give you many political answers
            paul but the truth is that africa is not
            worth a single vote to all of them:
            french, british, americans.

silence.

                        sabena president (cont'd)
            you have to get out of there, paul. i
            will do whatever i can.
