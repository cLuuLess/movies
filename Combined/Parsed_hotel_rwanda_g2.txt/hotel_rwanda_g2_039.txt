int. hotel lobby. day

the lobby buzzes with activity. at the reception, gregoire is
surrounded by a bbc news crew: gloria, young, chic female
reporter/producer, and jock, tough, experienced scottish cameraman, and
his local sound guy peter. gloria is upset.

                        gloria
            we reserved five rooms not two

                        gregoire
            i'm sorry, ma'am, but i see only two here
            in the computer.

jock sees paul.

                        jock
            paul, how the hell are ya'?

                        paul
            i am delighted to see you, mr. daglish.

                        jock
            they moved you from the diplomat?

                        paul
            promoted. house manager.

                        jock
            good for you.
                 (moves closer)
            we're having a little trouble, paul. we
            booked five rooms, but...

paul moves behind the desk.

                        paul
            let me check.

he punches into the computer.

                        paul
            ah, i see the mistake. you were reading
            cbc - the canadian broadcasting people
            instead of bbc gregoire.

close on the computer: it clearly states bbc - two rooms. gregoire
looks to paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger.

of course, the bbc, five rooms.
                 (lies)
            they are being prepared as we speak. i
            have ordered fresh flowers and
            complimentary champagne.

gloria picks up her bag.

                        gloria
            great, i really need a shower.

                        paul
            just give me a moment to get your keys.

paul better come up with three rooms fast. then he spots the reporter
benedict hovering at the door.

                        paul (cont'd)
                 (to gloria)
            excuse me for one second.

paul hurries over to benedict.

                        paul (cont'd)
            benedict, you should meet the bbc people.
            they could use your expertise.

benedict is delighted. they head back across the lobby.

                         paul (cont'd)
                 (whisper)
            benedict, general bizimungu will be here
            any moment. the bbc should talk to him.

they join the bbc team.

                        paul (cont'd)
            madame, this is benedict nangori, one of
            our best journalists. he covers all the
            big stories. i thought you should meet.

gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm.

                        gloria
            benedict, beautiful name. i'm gloria
            fleming. bbc.

paul moves off to the desk, gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure.

                        gregoire
            there are no more rooms.

                        paul
            give me the phone.

gregoire hands it over. paul dials.

                        paul (cont'd)
            madame denver. i have very good news. i
            have a present for you, in return for the
            cancellation of your gorilla expedition i
            have arranged a safari at lake kivu
            lodge. a wonderful experience. no, no
            extra charge. a luxury coach will leave
            in one hour. i'll send maids up to help
            you all pack. you're welcome.

paul hangs up, turns to gregoire.

                        paul (cont'd)
            call kivu lodge, ask for george, tell him
            i need three rooms. and send a team of
            maids up to the americans. i want those
            rooms turned around in twenty minutes.

paul heads for the glass doors and sees:
