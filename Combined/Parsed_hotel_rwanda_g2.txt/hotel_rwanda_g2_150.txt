ext. hotel roof. night

paul slips out onto the roof. tatiana follows. artillery and mortar
fire rumble in the distance. flashes silhouette along the far hills
above kigali.

he leads her to a blanket, a candle, two glasses and the bottle of
wine. they sit. he opens the wine.

                        tatiana
            (laughs) i hear we must pay for
            everything. how much for this?

                        paul
            a kiss.

they kiss.

                        tatiana
            you are a very good man, paul
            rusesabagina.

she kisses him again.

                        paul
            i have a confession. when we met...

                        tatiana
            in ruhengeri?

                        paul
            yes, when you worked as the nurse.

                        tatiana
            yes.

                        paul
            i had you transferred to kigali.

                        tatiana
            what?

                        paul
            i bribed the minister of health to have
            you transferred to kigali.

                        tatiana
            why?

                        paul
            to be closer. so that i could marry you.

                        tatiana
            what was the bribe?
                 (silence)
            what am i worth to you?

                        paul
            it was substantial.

                        tatiana
            tell me what it was.

                        paul
            a car.

                        tatiana
            what sort of car?

                        paul
            what does it matter.

                        tatiana
            i want to know.

                        paul
            a volkswagen.

                        tatiana
            a volkswagen!

she slaps him playfully.

                        tatiana (cont'd)
            i hope it was a new volkswagen.

she kisses him, they lie back on the roof, kiss passionately.
