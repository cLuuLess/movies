int. paul's bedroom. night

paul lies in bed unable to sleep. the clock reads 3:00 am.

                        tatiana
            why didn't you call your contacts in the
            army?

                        paul
            i couldn't help.

                        tatiana
            you could have asked for a favor.

                        paul
            no, i could not. what do you know about
            favors tatiana, about barter and deals?

all day long i work to please this
officer, that diplomat, this tourist. to
store up favors so that if there is a
time when my family need help i have
powerful people i can call upon. now you
would have me waste a precious favor on a
stranger.

                        tatiana
            victor was not a stranger, he was our
            neighbor.

                        paul
            he was not family. family is all that
            matters. do you think if you or i were
            being dragged from here, any one of them
            would lift a finger to help us?

                        tatiana
            they do not have your connections.

                        paul
            connections? i have no connections, only
            favors. if i call to help victor, a
            general will think "paul rusesabagina is
            a fool. he thinks my favors are so
            numerous and so insignificant as to waste
            them on everybody." then my hard work is
            doubly squandered. i insult the general
            and i do not get to use my favor at all.
            please leave these things to my good
            judgment.

his turn away indicates the discussion is over.
