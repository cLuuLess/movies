ext. hotel pool terrace. day

the pool patio is deserted except for general bizimungu and three
soldiers who lounge at a table. gregoire and his girlfriend sun on
reclining deck chairs like movie stars. paul and a waiter with a tray
of drinks join the general.

                        general bizimungu
            i am glad you are well.

paul hands the scotch to bizimungu.

                        paul
            i'm sorry it is not glenmorangie.

                        general bizimungu
            as long as it is scotch.
                 (drinks)
            your white friends have abandoned you,
            paul.

                        paul
            the united nations are still here.

                        general bizimungu
            (laughs) the united nations. madmen are
            on the streets, paul. but i will take
            care of you. (chugs his drink) your
            cellar is well-stocked, right?

                        paul
            yes, general. i am glad you came by. i
            overheard something that i think you
            should know about.

                        general bizimungu
            what did you overhear?

                        paul
            a discussion between an american embassy
            official and a un colonel.

                        general bizimungu
            what did they say?

                        paul
            the american assured the colonel that
            they would watch everything.

                        general bizimungu
            watch everything? how? they are gone.

paul points surreptitiously to the sky. the general looks up.

                        paul
            satellites.

                        general bizimungu
            satellites?

                        paul
            yes, they can photograph the epaulets on
            your shoulder.

                        general bizimungu
            and what will they do with these
            satellites?

                        paul
            the american said intervention is too
            costly, better to get photographic
            evidence and snatch up the high command.

                        general bizimungu
            the high command? our high command?

                        paul
            'snatch them up and put on a war crimes
            trial. lock them all away forever. no
            political risk, and big publicity.'
            that's what he said. (a beat) i thought
            i'd better tell you.

the general looks again to the sky then.

                        general bizimungu
            the americans! who are they to put us on
            trial. let us imagine paul when their
            president kennedy was shot, they said it
            was a black man. then their politicians,
            their radio stations gave orders we must
            wipe out these black people before they
            wipe out us. what do you think would
            have happened? no different.

                        paul (cont'd)
            indeed, general. excuse me momentarily.
