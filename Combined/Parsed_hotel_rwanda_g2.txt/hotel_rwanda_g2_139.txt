int. van. dawn

they pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box.

the van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over
broken glass, the fog swirls around them.

then gregoire hits the brakes.

in front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across
two oil drums.

they wait for someone to appear from the fog: no one.

                        gregoire
            we should go back, sir.

paul wants to agree, but can't. he opens his door.
