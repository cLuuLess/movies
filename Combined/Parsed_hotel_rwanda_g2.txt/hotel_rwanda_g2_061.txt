int. paul's kitchen. night

paul bursts through the back door and sets roger down. tatiana is
beside them.

                        tatiana
            roger!

paul turns the flashlight on roger. tatiana pulls back in horror:

roger is covered in blood. her screams, stifled by fear.

                        tatiana (cont'd)
            oh, my god!

                        paul
            where are you hurt, son?

roger stares blankly. odette is beside them now.

                        odette
            get his clothes off.

hands pull and tear his clothes off. towels wipe him down. odette
looks all over his body with the flashlight. despite the blood roger
has no injuries.

                        paul
            what happened, son? where did you get
            this blood?

but roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. children cry.

                        odette
            he's not injured.

his paralysis freaks the women in the room. paul turns angrily to them.

                        paul
            leave us, give us some space.

he ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door.

                        paul (cont'd)
                 (to tatiana)
            the neighbors must go at dawn.

tatiana hugs her son.
