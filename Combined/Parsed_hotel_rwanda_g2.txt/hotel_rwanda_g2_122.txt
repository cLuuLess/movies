ext. hotel forecourt. day

paul with the printed registry and zozo with beer walk to the jeeps.

the soldiers don't wait for the captain's order, they mob zozo, grab
beers. the lieutenant marches up to paul.

                        lieutenant
            where's the guest list?

paul hands him the printout. he studies it, reads.

                        lieutenant (cont'd)
            anderson, arthurs, boulier. what is this?

                        paul
            the guest list. it hasn't been updated
            since the murder of the president.

the lieutenant grabs paul by the shirt.

                        lieutenant
            are you trying to make a fool of me?
            there are no europeans left in that
            hotel. get me the names of all the
            cockroaches in there.

                        paul
            that will take time.

                        lieutenant
            you don't have time. if i do not have the
            names, so that i can pick out the
            traitors, then i will kill everyone here
            in this car park. get in there now.

paul turns to walk back in. the lieutenant hurries to his men, pulls
beers from their hands, smashes them on the ground. one soldier comes
running to him with a radio. paul watches. the lieutenant listens, then
calls to paul.

                        lieutenant (cont'd)
            hey you, come here.

paul returns.

                        lieutenant (cont'd)
            who did you call?

                        paul
            call, sir?

                        lieutenant
            don't lie to me. what's your name?

                        paul
            rusesabagina. paul rusesabagina.

                        lieutenant
            i will remember that name. (turns to his
            soldiers) let's go.

the soldiers roar off down the driveway.

zozo looks to paul, a thank you jesus look.
