int. paulÂ’s living room. dawn

paul steps out, closes the door behind him. a small delegation of the
men wait nervously.

                        jean baptiste
            it is true.

he holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the bbc world service, a crackly
brit voice. (it's gloria the reporter.)

                        gloria the reporter (o.s.)
            the hutu president's plane was struck by
            a ground-to-air missile as he returned
            from signing the peace accord with the
            tutsi rebels. there were no survivors.
            the hutu government has already blamed
            the tutsi rebels. the rebels have denied
            the accusation. already there are reports
            of reprisal killings on the streets.

as they listen, a young woman lets out a squeal, and flees the window
where she's been sitting.

                        women (o.s.)
            they are here.

hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. paul
manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees:

a hutu army soldier sits on the high wall by the gate. he pulls another
up beside him.

panic in the room now. paul turns.

                        paul
            shut up!

paul's pov: the soldiers drop into his garden. they draw pistols.

                        tatiana (o.s.)
            what is it, paul.

                        paul
            stay with the children.

paul's pov: the soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open.

two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed soldiers, sit in the drive like
many-limbed beasts of war. paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his
garden. the soldiers jump out.

inside the room:

nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms.

paul is frozen at the crash of rifles on the door.

the door gives, soldiers flood in.

they are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised,
shouts.

                        soldiers
            out, get out now!
            paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier.

                        paul
            who is in charge?

a captain is at the door.

                        captain
            who are you?

                        paul
            i am paul rusesabagina, a good friend of
            general bizimungu.

                        captain
            we are looking for you.

he takes paul by the arm, leads him outside.
