int. jeep travelling. day

the jeep turns away from the mille collines front gate.

they travel at high speed along the road. then the driver sounds his
horn, because...

paul sees: a large crowd of militia marching along the road toward the
hotel, waving machetes and sticks.

                        paul
            where are they going?

                        general bizimungu
            they can go where they want. they are in
            charge now.

                        paul
            what do you mean, general?

                        general bizimungu
            we have decided to move the government to
            gitarama.

                        paul
            when?

                        general bizimungu
            today.
