ext. hotel front gate. day

as jock films, paul arrives by the gate house. un soldiers watch the
outside road. engines roar, then.

a convoy of toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. drunken
militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco
wig, waves a cordless power drill. the drill bit is red with blood.

in the next truck, two militia men triumphantly taunt the un soldiers
as they hold blue un helmets high on sticks. the helmets are shot
through with holes.

                        militiaman #1
            we kill un. we kill you next.

enraged un soldiers cock their weapons, aim.

a un armored car races past the militia and turns into the driveway.

the back door opens, un colonel oliver jumps out.

                        colonel oliver
            hold the line here. do not shoot!
            the colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive
            by. paul approaches oliver

                        paul
            what's happening?

                        colonel oliver
            they murdered my soldiers. ten belgians
            who i sent to get the lady minister.

                        paul
            where is she?

oliver shakes his head. he helps paul clamber into the armored car.
