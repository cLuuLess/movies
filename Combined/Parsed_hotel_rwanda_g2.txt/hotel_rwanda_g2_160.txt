the truck starts up. paul runs beside it, shouts to tatiana.

                        paul
            i love you. keep the children safe.

                        tatiana
            paul!
            then another voice.

                        roger
            papa! papa!
            the convoy takes off down the driveway.

paul, zozo and other refugees cluster by the door.

zozo looks round,
sees: gregoire put a phone down.
