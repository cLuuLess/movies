       jimmy comes out, tries to take a chair not too far from
       frank who's watching his nephew toss pop-up flies for the
       younger kids to catch.

                              frank
                 stevie. come over here.
                        (the nephew comes over)
                 i heard you didn't show up.
                              (more)
                                                                   (cont)

                                                                       81.

                                 frank (cont'd)
                   you're     too busy to meet with billy
                   martin?   after i set it up?

      stevie shifts around, not wanting to make frank mad ...

                                stevie
                   i don't want to play pro ball, i decided.

                                  frank
                   what're you   talking about? this is your
                   dream since   you were their age -
                          (the   younger kids)
                   maybe i can   set it up again.

      stevie just stands there, uncomfortable.         finally -

                                stevie
                   it's not what i want. i want to do what
                   you do, uncle frank. i want to be you.

      frank stares at him unhappily.       teddy comes over but frank
      barely notices.

                                teddy
                   we got a problem.
