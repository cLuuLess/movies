118   int. red top's apartment - harlem - day                      118

      empty milk sugar boxes. redtop and her five table workers
      - clothed now, the surgical masks dangling from their necks -
      wiping down table surfaces, scales and apparatus. tens of
      thousands of blue-cellophane packets of heroin neatly cover
      two of the folding tables.

                                                                  51.
