     tango and his bodyguard come in and approach frank's table
     where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast.

                            tango
               didn't you see the jar, frank?
               i think you walked right past it.

     frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats.    tango sits.

                            tango
               the money jar. on the corner.      what i
               got to do, put a sign on it?

     frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't
     full. he swallows finally, but then only reaches for his
     coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating tango.
                                                                 (cont)

                               tango
                  bumpy don't own 116th street no more,
                  frank. bumpy don't own no real estate in
                  harlem no more. i'm the landlord now and
                  the lease is twenty-percent.

     frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives tango a look
     that says that won't be happening.

                               tango
                  then don't sell dope, frank. get a
                  fuckin job. you need a job? you can be
                  my driver, drive me around, open my door,
                  yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right
                  away, massa johnson, sir.

     right now tango is dead. no doubt about it.          on the
     surface, though, frank remains cool.

                               frank
                  twenty percent?

                               tango
                  of every dollar. every vig, every
                  truckload, every girl, every ounce.      in
                  the jar.

                               frank
                  twenty percent's my profit. if i'm
                  giving it to you then what am i doing?
                  twenty percent puts me, and everyone you
                  know, out of business, which puts you out
                  of business.
                         (reaches for his breakfast
                          check)
                  there are ways to make money
                  legitimately, and then there's this way.
                  not even bumpy took twenty percent.

                               tango
                  bumpy's fuckin dead.

     frank regards tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money
     clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a
     $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of tango.

                                frank
                  there.   that's twenty-percent.

     as he turns and leaves, tango watches after him ...

                                                                 17.
