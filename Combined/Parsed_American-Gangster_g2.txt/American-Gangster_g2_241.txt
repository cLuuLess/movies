343   int. county jail - interview room - day                        343

      wire mesh separates frank from his battalion of lawyers.
      he glances over them to richie being led through the large
      visiting room.

                                frank
                   here he is, let me talk to him alone.
                                                                    (cont)

                                                                       120.
                                 
343   continued:                                                        343


      the attorneys get up and leave. richie takes their place.
      frank regards him a moment, offering the same knowing smile
      from the courtroom. richie offers nothing.

                                frank
                   i just heard something. i said it
                   couldn't be true. you didn't really
                   turn in a million dollars you found
                   in the trunk of a car, did you?

      richie doesn't say. frank searches his face for some clue
      to where on earth he's from.

                                frank
                   want me to tell you what happened to
                   it? it ended up in cops' pockets.

                                  richie
                   maybe.

                                frank
                   maybe? no. it did. all you did was
                   give it to them for nothing in return.
                   not nothing: you got their contempt.

      frank studies him.

                                frank
                   why'd you do that? what're you trying
                   to prove, you're better than them? you're
                   not better than them. you are them.

                                richie
                   i don't have the time or interest to
                   listen to (this) -

                                frank
                   you did it because it was right.
                   that's all. why's that hard to say?
                   the question is would you do it again?
                   that was a long time ago. it'd be very
                   easy to find out. tell me you want to
                   find out, tell me the address, and a car
                   will be there, the trunk loaded.

      richie knows frank isn't kidding ...

                                  richie
                   no, thanks.

      frank suddenly explodes -


                                                                       (cont)

                                                                     121.
                               
343   continued:                                                      343


                                frank
                   who the fuck are you to say no to
                   that? you think that impresses me?

      guards look over, then glance away once it's clear the
      outburst is through. richie remains serene. eventually -

                                frank
                   let me ask you something. you think by
                   putting me in jail, you're going to stop
                   even one junkie from dying? because you
                   won't. if it isn't me, it'll be someone
                   else. with me or without me, nothing's
                   going to change.

                                richie
                   then that's the way it is.

                                frank
                   you have any sort of case? or just
                   that idiot drives for my brother. is he
                   your case? because if it's just him and
                   the powder, it's not enough.

                                richie
                   then you got nothing to worry about.

      but frank is worried, most of all by this cop who doesn't
      take money sitting placidly in front of him.

                                frank
                   my brothers won't talk to you. my
                   cousins. none of my family. no one but
                   that mother fucking driver.
                                richie
                   i got more than that. i got a line of
                   people wanting to testify that stretches
                   out the door and around the block.

                                frank
                   bullshit.

                                richie
                   is it? tony the bug.     benny two-socks.
                   carmine camanetti.

                                frank
                   who the fuck are they? i don't know
                   them and they don't know me.



                                                                     (cont)

                                                                    122.
                              
343   continued:                                                     343


                                richie
                   they sell dope for the mazzano crime                      
                   family. which you all but put out of
                   business.

                                frank
                   this is who you're going to put on the
                   stand? guys who don't know me? who got
                   nothing to do with me?

                                richie
                   they have everything to do with you.
                   and the only thing they hate more than
                   you is what you represent.

                                frank
                   i don't represent nothing.

                                richie
                   you don't? black businessman like you?
                   of course you do. but once you're gone,
                   things can return to normal.

                                frank
                   look at me. you looking? can you tell
                   by looking it would mean nothing to me if
                   tomorrow you turned up dead?

                                richie
                   get in line. that one stretches around
                   the block, too.

      frank has never been so frustrated by anyone in his life.
      he wants to work something out with richie obviously, but he
      can't figure out how. frank studies him.

                                frank
                   what can we do?

                                richie
                   you know what you have to do.                             

      frank does, but doesn't like it, and doesn't know if he can            
      do it.                                                                 

                                frank                                        
                   i could give you cops, but that's not                     
                   who you want, is it. you want organized                   
                   crime names.                                              

                                richie                                       
                   i'll take them, too.   i want them all.                   

                                                                    (cont)

                                                                    123.
                              
343   continued:                                                     343


      frank isn't sure he heard right.                                       

                                frank                                        
                   you'll take them, too? you'd go after                     
                   cops? are you serious? you'd do that?                     
                   lock up your own kind?

                                richie
                   they're not. not the ones in business                     
                   with you. they're not my kind any more                    
                   than the italians are yours.

      they regard one another in silence.      richie can tell frank
      sees daylight.

                                frank
                   what can you promise me?

                                richie
                   i can promise you if you lie to me about
                   one name, you'll never get out of prison.
                   lie about one dollar in one offshore
                   account, you'll never get out. you can
                   live rich in jail the rest of your life,
                   or poor outside it, that's what i can
                   promise.

      frank is silent for several moments.      finally -

                                frank
                   you know, i don't care if the feds take
                   all my buildings, my stocks, my off-shore
                   accounts. they can take it all, i don't
                   care - use it to build battleships, paint
                   bridges, whatever the fuck they want.
                   fight another war. but those other
                   motherfuckers - the cops - put my money
                   in their pockets. millions.

                                richie
                   i believe it.

      frank debates with himself the step he's about to take ...

                                richie
                   i want to know everyone   you've met for                  
                   the last twenty years.    everyone you sold               
                   to. every cop you ever    paid off. every                 
                   one who ever stole from   you. every one
                   you remember.



                                                                    (cont)

                                                                    124.
                              
343   continued:                                                     343


                                frank
                   oh, i remember them all.   that's not the
                   problem.

                               richie
                   what is?

                                frank
                   the jail's aren't big enough.
