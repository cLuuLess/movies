      richie's had jimmy racine brought over. sits with him as
      the three amigos watch from the shadows. just coming off
      his high, and the attempted murder, jimmy looks disoriented
      as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement.

                             richie
                because it's an attempted homicide,
                that's grand jury. now, that grand jury
                could come in very favorably. might turn
                out to be attempted manslaughter. self
                defense even. she had a knife. depends
                on how i want to deal with you. you see
                where this is going.

      jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern.

                             jimmy
                the fuck is this place?

                             richie
                let's say you beat it somehow. what do
                you think cousin frank'll think of that?
                he knows you had to sit here listening to
                something like this. and then you beat
                an attempted murder? is he stupid?
                he'll assume you talked.

      jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him.


                                                                   (cont)

                                richie
                   you fucked up, jimmy. but nobody knows.
                   frank doesn't know. yet. do you want him
                   to read about it in the paper? or do you
                   want to walk out of here - no bail, no
                   trial - just walk out, now.
