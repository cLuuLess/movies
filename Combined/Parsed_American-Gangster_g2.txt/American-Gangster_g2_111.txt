159   int. tosca's smoking room    - later - day                      159

      tosca opens a humidor, takes out a couple of cuban cigars.

                                tosca
                   now what if - i'm just thinking out loud -
                   you sold some of your inventory wholesale
                   and i helped with the distribution.
                                                                     (cont)

                                frank
                   i don't need it. i already got
                   everything from 110th street to yankee
                   stadium, river to river.

                                tosca
                   which is a little mom and pop store
                   compared to what i'm talking about. i
                   could make you bigger than k-mart. l.a.,
                   chicago, detroit, vegas. i'm speaking
                   nationwide. and i'd guarantee you peace
                   of mind. you know what i mean by that.

      frank does. it's a backhanded threat.        tosca clips the
      cigars with a gold guillotine

                                tosca
                   frank. you can see i'm a renaissance
                   man. unfortunately not all my people are
                   as enlightened. ask them, what is civil
                   rights, they don't know. they're not as
                   open to change from the way things are
                   done and who's doing it. but i can talk
                   to them so there won't be any
                   misunderstanding. that's what i mean by
                   peace of mind.

      frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in
      this matter. still, maybe it's not so bad.

                                frank
                   you pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? i'd
                   consider 50. and i can get you as much
                   as you want.
      tosca slips on his best poker face. fifty thousand a kilo
      would be an extraordinary coup for him.

                                tosca
                   you see, i was right. this is a
                   historic moment. you're going to be
                   bigger than bumpy himself.

      he hands frank one of the cigars, expertly prepared.

                                tosca
                   can't smoke it here, unfortunately.
                   grace doesn't like it. take it with you.

                                                                   67.
                             




160   int/ext. tosca's mansion - later - day                        160

      doc waits by the car as frank and ana walk toward him.
      the toscas wave goodbye from the front step of the mansion.
      frank slips the cigar into his top pocket as they climb in.

                             ana
                why would you trust these people, the way
                they look at you?

                             frank
                they look at me like it's christmas and
                i'm santa claus.

                             ana
                they looked at us like we're the help.

                              frank
                        (kisses her cheek)
                no.   they're working for me now.
