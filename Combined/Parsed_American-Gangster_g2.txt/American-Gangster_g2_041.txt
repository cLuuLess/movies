53      int. soul brothers bar - night                                   53

        the clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on r&r
        and asian women. a trio of ex-gi's plays authentic southern
        blues on a small stage. ham hocks and collard greens come
        out of the kitchen. smoke chokes the place.

        frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or
        stoned, sits alone at a table with a coca-cola and surveys
        the activity: dope being rolled. dope being smoked. dope
        being shot. gi's and prostitutes climbing a staircase.

        his eyes follow an army master sergeant, moving among the
        tables as if checking on the gi's well being. but at some,
        his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder.

        the sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching
        frank watching him from across the room. he squints through
        the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in
        a kind of shock, more to himself -
                                 nate
                     frank - ?

        frank half-lifts his glass to wave, and nate beams.
