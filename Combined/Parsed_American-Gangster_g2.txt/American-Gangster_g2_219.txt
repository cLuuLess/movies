           the sea of ladies' hats from above move in time with the
           gospel choir. as always, no matter what else is going on in
           his complicated life, frank sits with his mother and ana in
           their usual pew. the gospel music continues over:

           frank emerges from the church, kisses his mother and ana and
           put them in a car with a driver. he climbs into doc's
           alone. his mother watches, wondering perhaps if he intends
           to go kill trupo after all. as doc's car leaves, so does
           another.
