28   ext. parking lot - newark - night                              28

     all the other cars are gone. rivera climbs into richie's              
     with coffee and a coke in a bag, hands him the can.                   

                            rivera                                         
               think he made us?

     richie doesn't know. glances at his watch.      cranes in his
     seat to look behind them.
                            richie
               you called for the warrant?     where are
               they?

                            rivera                                         
               i just called. i called and walked back
               here and ten seconds has gone by.

     richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street
     lamps buzz, grows impatient. indicating the other car:

                            richie
               we saw him with the slips, javy.                            

                            rivera                                         
               you saw policy slips? you saw grocery
               bags. you don't know what's in them.


                                                                  (cont)

                                                                      13.
                                
28   continued:                                                         28


                               richie
                  yes, i do, and so do you, don't give me
                  that bullshit -

                               rivera                                          
                  what's the rush? half an hour the
                  warrant'll be here -

                               richie
                  i got night school.

                               rivera                                          
                  guess you're going to miss it.
                         (rivera sips at his coffee;                           
                          then:)                                               
                  you know, what you were saying before
                  - about throwing up in front of people -
                  money will take that feeling away.

                               richie
                  not when it's less.

                               rivera                                          
                  less than what.

                               richie
                  than what i make now.

                               rivera                                          
                  no lawyer on earth makes less than a cop.

                               richie
                  they do in the prosecutor's office.
                  three thousand less.
                               rivera                                          
                  you're fuckin kidding me.

     richie isn't kidding. rivera stares at him like he's crazy.               
     richie checks his watch. he's waited long enough.

                                richie
                  fuck this -

                                rivera                                         
                  richie -

     richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a slimjim and
     bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the
     accountant's car, rivera following. richie trips the                      
     passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as
     he comes around back to search it -

                                                                      (cont)

                                                                    14.
                              
28   continued:                                                       28


                               richie
                  check inside.

     rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one           
     anymore, is done. he crawls inside the car to look under
     the seats and in the glove compartment. gravely -

                              richie
                  javy ...                                                 

     richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside.
     rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of           
     it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more          
     than either of them has ever seen. as the trunk closes -
