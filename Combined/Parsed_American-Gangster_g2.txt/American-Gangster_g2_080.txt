      ana considers some family photographs on a mantle.

                                ana
                   this is your father?

      frank shakes his head no.       it's a picture of bumpy.

                                frank
                   you really don't know who that is?
                          (she doesn't)
                   it's martin luther king.

                                ana
                   it is not.

                                frank
                   you're right. he was as important as dr.
                   king, though.
                                                                      (cont)

                                                                     47.

                                ana
                   what'd he do?

                                frank
                   a lot of things. he had a lot of
                   friends. he served new york and it
                   served him.

                                ana
                   what was he to you?

      frank has to think.     bumpy was more than his employer.

                                frank
                   teacher.

                                ana
                   what'd he teach you?

                                frank
                   how to take my time ... how if you're
                   going to do something, do it with care
                   ... do it with love.

      and it's working here.     it's seductive.

                                ana
                   anything else?

      flashcuts -

      sudden bursts of violence - guys beat up - others shot - one
      being poured with gasoline as bumpy looks on calmly -
      back to frank's living room

      the same calm, benign face in the photograph.        frank nods.

                                frank
                   how be a gentleman.

                                ana
                   that's what you are?

      ana smiles like she knows better. any second now, like
      every other guy she's ever met, she's sure he'll try to take
      her upstairs.

                                frank
                   i got five different apartments in the
                   city i could've taken you to. i brought
                   you here instead -

                                                                     (cont)

                                                                          48.
                                    
           continued:


           ana glances to the stairs which frank's mother is coming
           down.

                                    frank
                        to meet my mother.

                                     mrs. lucas
                        is this her? oh, she's beautiful,
                        frank. look at her. she's an angel
                        come down from heaven.

           mrs. lucas embraces ana like family.
