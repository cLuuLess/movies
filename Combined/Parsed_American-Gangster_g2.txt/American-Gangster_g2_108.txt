                     yeah, i know, like everyone else.
                     some of them will steal no matter what.                    
                     there can be a camera on them they'll do
                     it. some'll never do it. the rest are                      
                     capable of either, depending how their
                     department leans ... only theirs isn't
                     leaning, it's fallen over. the patrol                      
                     cars don't even stop in harlem, just roll                  
                     down the window so the dealers can throw                   
                     the money in. i saw drops made on

                     i don't want to hear about you going
                     into new york anymore.

                                  richie
                     then my investigation's over.

                                  toback
                     you're not listening to me. i said:
                     i don't want to hear about it ... you do
                     whatever you have to do, go wherever you
                     have to go to find out who's bringing

        woman in the hall holding a briefcase.

        he has no idea who the black woman is. an old girlfriend                  
        he's forgotten maybe. behind him, vida can see a stewardess               
        buttoning up her uniform by a little travel case on wheels.               
        the apartment itself, she can also see, is a mess.

      barbecue after their sunday softball game. richie and his
      o.c. friends - wise guys - still in their brown and orange
      weequahie jerseys, drinking beer, cooking hamburgers.

                             tony
                when you asked me to be your son's
                godfather, i took it very seriously.

                             richie
                i know.

      richie and tony zaca relax in the den-like pool house.

                             tony
                i said yes, i'd take on this
                responsibility, take care of your son,
                god forbid something happened to you -

                             richie
                tony, the things she's telling child
                social services make me look very bad:
                out all night. lowlife informants
                hanging around.   women -

                             tony
                old friends like me.

      richie feels horrible doing this.    silence.   then:

                             tony
                it's all right. i understand. they
                ask me, i'll tell them what you want me
                to tell them. i'll lie for you.

                             richie
                thank you.

      tony nods, you're welcome.    can tell there's something else
      on richie's mind.

                             tony
                what.

                             richie
                you don't have to talk about it, you
                don't want. what do you hear about blue
                magic? anything?

                             tony
                a lot of sorrow and misery from guys
                being put out of business. that's all.
                                                                   (cont)

                                richie
                   nothing about who's bringing it in?

                                tony
                   guys down south is all i heard.

                                richie
                   down south, florida?   cubans?   what.

                                tony
                   i don't know. all i can tell you is
                   whoever it is, they're upsetting the
                   natural order of things.

      among the framed family photos around them, is a picture
      of tony's uncle, albert tosca.
