76   int. frank's teaneck house - later - day                           76

     the wonderful noise continues downstairs as frank leads his
     mother on a tour of the upstairs. the place is a showroom
     of traditional americana.

                               frank
                  this is your room.

     mrs. lucas is   in awe of the splendor of the bedroom and its
     furnishings.    it's unlike anything she's used ever seen -
     not graceland   exactly - but not far off. her eyes settle on
     an old vanity   dotted with french perfume bottles.

                               mrs. lucas
                  how did you ...

                               frank
                  i had it made. from memory.
                               mrs. lucas
                  you were five when they took it away.
                  how could you remember it?

                                frank
                  i remember.

     she's stunned. touches the reproduction of the vanity her
     son last saw more than thirty years ago.

                               mrs. lucas
                  it's perfect.
                         (looks at the room)
                  it's all perfect.
                         (she looks at him)
                  i'm so proud of you.

                                                                 36.
