      richie stands over the nearest coffin -

                                 richie
                   open it.

      the army captain regards the detective for a long moment.

                                richie
                   the warrant permits me to search the
                   plane and its cargo.

      the captain doesn't comply. richie moves to open the coffin
      himself and every soldier's shouldered rifle immediately
      comes into firing position, aimed at him.

                                army captain
                   but you don't have my permission.

      richie stares at the weapons and the uniformed men holding
      them, safeties off, fingers on the triggers; all they're
      waiting for is their commander's order to fire.

                                richie
                   i don't need it.
