100   int. nightclub - newark - same time - night                     100

      a club across the river. not nearly as nice as small's -
      much louder - but like small's, almost all black. richie
      shares a booth with a black undercover detective.

                                richie
                   i'm reluctant to bring anyone in i
                   don't personally know.

                                spearman
                   you know me, and i vouch for them.

      richie nods, yeah, he knows that, but remains unconvinced.

                                spearman
                   richie, we work together. you want me,
                   you got to take them, too.

                                richie
                   where are they?
      spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor.

                                spearman
                   that's jones. with the skinny white
                   woman.

      richie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with
      his skinny white date.

                                spearman
                   that's abruzzo, with the fat black one.

      richie sees a young italian with tatoos - the only other
      white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman.
      both jones and abruzzo look more like criminals than cops.

                                spearman
                   both are good with wires. have good
                   informants. they're honest. and they're
                   fearless. they'll do anything. they're
                   insane, richie, like you.
