75   int. frank's teaneck house - later - day                           75

     the house is alive with the noise of family and scent of
     home-cooked food as the extended lucas clan - there's more
     than twenty of them - sits around a big dining room table
     passing the platters around. frank, at the head of the
     table, clearly loves having them all here.

                               turner
                  he got an arm on him.     major league arm,
                  ain't that right.

     everyone agrees as turner's son - frank's nephew - the 18-
     year-old boy seen pitching in the north carolina back yard -
     tries to shrug.
                                                                      (cont)

                               frank
                  you show me after supper.

                               turner
                  you can't catch him. he'll take your
                  head off. we're talking 95-mile-an-hour.
                  you know how fast that is? you see the
                  ball leave his hand, and that's the last
                  you see it before it knocks you down.

                               frank
                         (smiling; happy)
                  is that right.
