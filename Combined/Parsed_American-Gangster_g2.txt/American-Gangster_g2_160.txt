217   int. teddy's car - moving - late afternoon                        217

      jimmy racine behind the wheel.       frank and teddy in back,
      speaking quietly.

                                teddy
                   he's been cutting it so much it's down
                   to two, three percent pure.
                                frank
                   you tested it. you're sure.

      teddy nods. frank notices jimmy looking at them in the rear
      view mirror.

                                frank
                   the fuck you looking at?
