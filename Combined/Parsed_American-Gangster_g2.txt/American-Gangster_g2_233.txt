334    int. 17th floor hallway - day                                334

       half the apartment doors are gone. tvs and radios echo,
       voices argue, infants wail. the detectives come around a
       corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a
       sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door.

       they step back. consider one other. spearman volunteers
       with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. he walks
       up to the guys with the guns.

                              spearman
                 i got to talk to teddy.

                              guy with gun
                 get the fuck out of here.

                                                                  (cont)

                                                                    117.

                                spearman
                   what the fuck is that? i got business
                   with teddy and it's none of your fuckin
                   business except to knock on the fuckin
                   door and get him.

      as the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, spearman yanks it
      hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the
      floor. the shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets.
      jones and abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as
      richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -
