355   ext. 116th street, harlem - day                               355

      the two of them stand outside richie's car on the same
      corner frank shot tango. frank looks up at the street signs
      that used to say 116th street and 8th avenue. now they say
      116th street and frederick douglass boulevard.

                              frank
                 frederick douglass boulevard? what was
                 wrong with just plain 8th avenue?

      he considers the street itself. it too has changed. the
      corner groceries, as bumpy prophesied, really are gone now.



                                                                  (cont)

                                                                     126.
                               
355   continued:                                                      355


                                frank
                   i used to sit here with ana in my old
                   car. she hated it. now i don't even
                   have a car. or her.

      frank glances to where his favorite diner used to be, and
      across the street to where he shot tango. it isn't a fruit
      stand any more.

                                frank
                   just do what?

                                richie
                   what?

                                frank
                   the fuck is that? just do what?

      it's a nike store with huge paintings of michael jordan and
      the admonition "just do it."

                                 richie
                   sneakers.   expensive ones.

                                frank
                   who the fuck would buy those?

      a car equipped with sub-woofer bass comes booming past.
      frank stares at it with the same pained look bumpy had at
      the discount emporium.

                                richie
                   your brothers know you're out?
                                frank
                   i haven't talked to them in years. it's
                   better that way. for them. i don't know
                   where they are. went back to greensboro
                   when they got out, i guess.

      richie nods.    frank looks back at the new storefronts.

                                frank
                   what am i going to do now, be a janitor?
                   what do i know how to do? how am i going
                   to live?

                                richie
                   i told you i wouldn't let you starve.

                                frank
                   you told me but you can barely take care
                   of yourself.
                                (more)
                                                                     (cont)

                                                                     127.
                               
355   continued:                                                      355
                                frank (cont'd)
                          (glances to a pay phone on
                           the corner)
                   you know, one phone call, richie, i could
                   be back in business.

      the look richie gives him calmly assures frank if he did
      that it'd be the last phone he made outside prison - ever.

                                 frank
                   i won't.   i'm just saying i could.

      he buttons the cuffs of the fake members only windbreaker
      richie bought him off the street.

                                frank
                   thanks for the clothes.

                                richie
                   you're welcome.

      frank glances away to three young hoods coming toward them
      like they own the sidewalk and everything around it - baggy
      pants, bandanas tied around their heads.

                               frank
                   uh-oh. look out. here come the
                   gangsters.

      frank's right in their path but doesn't move, forcing one
      of them to squeeze between him and a parking meter. the
      gangsta looks back, is about to say something, or do
      something, but, examining the expression of quiet menace on
      frank's face, thinks better of it. the others stop.

                                gangsta 2
                   what.

      the first one is still staring at frank, but finally has the
      good sense to let it go.

                                gangsta 1
                   nothing.

      they move on.    frank glances to richie.

                                frank
                   every idiot gets to be young once.

      frank zips up his members only jacket, props up the collar
      and points himself in the other direction.

                                frank
                   let's get out of here.
