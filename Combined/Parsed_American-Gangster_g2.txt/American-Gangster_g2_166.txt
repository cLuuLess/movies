223   ext. garment warehouse district - ny - late afternoon           223

      as trupo and his partner climb out of their car and approach
      teddy's -

                              teddy
                frank?   some of it's in the trunk.

      frank regards him with utter disbelief. teddy shies as if
      he expects to get hit. the siu detectives arrive.

                             trupo
                hello, frank.

                             frank
                detective. how's it going?        you have a
                nice thanksgiving?

                             trupo
                i did not, as a matter of fact.       get out
                of the car.

      the lucases climb out.

                             frank
                where's the shelby?

                             trupo
                the shelby's gone, frank.

      trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys
      from the ignition and comes around to the trunk. frank and
      teddy exchange a glance as it opens. silence. then -
                             trupo
                want to come over here a minute, frank?

      six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light.
      frank and trupo regard it in silence. then -

                             trupo
                now what are we gonna do about this?

                             frank
                we're gonna shut the trunk and say good
                night, forget you pulled us over.

                             trupo
                i got a better idea.

      trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin
      bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at frank -

                                                                     (cont)

                                                                          86.
                                    
223    continued:                                                         223


                                 trupo
                    or would you rather i took it all and
                    threw you and your brother in the fuckin
                    river?

                                 frank
                    i don't know, would you rather it's your
                    fuckin house blows up next time?

       they hold each others' stare for a long moment.

                                 trupo
                    i loved that car.

                                    frank
                    i know.

       trupo closes the trunk and walks away with his cut of the
       heroin, calling to his partner -

                                    trupo
                    let's go.

       as the siu cops walk to their car, the perspective shifts,
       through binoculars: richie watching.

a224   int. teddy's car / street - later - night                          a224

       from outside the driver's side, teddy's head, inside the
       car, suddenly smashes against the window, cracking it. his
       groan is interrupted by frank's muffled voice -

                                 frank
                    don't you ever put me in a car with dope
                    in it.
