       richie, on a pay phone across down the street from the
       projects, looks up at the dark south tower.

                 lou. we're ready to go in there
                 knowing there's a good chance we won't
                 all come out. that's what we're willing
                 to do. all i'm asking you to do get me a
                 warrant.

       silence on the other end of the line ...

                              richie
                 we don't have a lot of time to fuck
                 around -

                    i'll call in the warrant. and some
                    backup. don't go in before either gets
                    there.

       this call disconnects.
