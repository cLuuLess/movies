133   int. frank's penthouse apartment - night                        133
      as ana tries to clean the blood stain on the rug with salt
      and soda water, frank sits with his five brothers in the
      debris-strewn aftermath of the party. silence before:

                                frank
                   i can't have this kind of stupidity.

                                teddy
                   it was an accident.   he feels terrible
                   about it.

                                frank
                   he doesn't feel shit, coked up all the
                   time. get rid of him.




                                                                     (cont)

                                                                        55.

                               teddy
                   frank. he's your cousin. what's he
                   gonna do? go back home? i'll talk to
                   him. i'll straighten him out.

      frank looks at teddy in his tinted jackie fox-like goggle
      glasses - like he's going to straighten anybody out.

                                frank
                   gimme those glasses.

                                  teddy
                   what?   why?

      frank pulls them from teddy's face and crushes them.
