     one of the same undercover cops - detective trupo -
     scribbles a signature and badge number different from the
     one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting
     evidence needed in court.

     he pushes the voucher under a sign - "all handguns and
     narcotics before 10am next window" - to a clerk who takes it
     past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic
     bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts.
     bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie
     unwrapped with dangling tags.

     the clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable
     items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks
     the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase.
