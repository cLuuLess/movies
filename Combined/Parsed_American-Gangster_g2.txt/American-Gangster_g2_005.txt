6   int. bumpy's apartment - later                                     6

    the report continues on a tv no one's really watching here:
    a march of time-like history of bumpy johnson, famed harlem
    gangster, robin hood and killer.

                              reporter on tv
                 he was a great man, according to the
                 eulogies. a giving man. a man of the
                 people. no one chose to include in their
                 remembrances the word most often
                 associated with ellsworth bumpy johnson:
                 gangster.

    sitting off by himself in bumpy's elegant garden apartment,
    heretofore his private sanctuary, frank surveys the mourners
    circling the place like vultures:

    tango black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and
    tended bar ... jackie fox, surrounded by his ever-present
    coterie of sycophants ... albert tosca, an elegant italian
    capo, and an underling, rossi, at the bar.

                              tosca
                 white wine, please.

    a white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down
    next to frank.

                              banker
                 how you doing, frank?

                              frank
                 all right.

                              banker
                 what a loss.
                        (frank nods)
                 how are you otherwise?   things okay
                 financially?
                                                                    (cont)

                                                                    4.
                              
6   continued:                                                        6


    frank doesn't say. it feels unseemly to him to be talking
    about money here. he watches tango carelessly set a watery
    glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.

                              banker
                 bumpy set something up for you?

    frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where
    tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.

                              tango
                 hey, frank, get me an ashtray while
                 you're at it.

    bumpy's german shepherd watches as frank reaches into his
    jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. he
    takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens
    a drawer and removes an ashtray. he holds it out to tango -
    who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.

                              charlie
                 i know you're hurting, frank.    so am i.

    frank sits back down with charlie williams, an older dope
    man.

                              charlie
                 you going to be all right?

                             frank
                 yeah.

                              charlie
                 i'm sure bumpy never told you, but he
                 made me promise, anything ever happened
                 to him, i'd make sure you didn't go
                 without.

                              frank
                 i'll be fine, charlie. half the people
                 here owed bumpy money when he died. a
                 lot of money. if they think i'm going
                 to forget to collect, they're wrong.

                              charlie
                 that's the spirit. go get them.

    on the tv, over archive film and photographs of crime
    figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered
    that bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."

                                                                     5.

     a figure, his back to us, walks slowly toward a blackboard
     like a man to the gallows.

     richie roberts turns and faces his classmates, all of them a
     decade or more younger than him.
