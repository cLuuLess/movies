     int. police gym - day

     the tv is in a small police gym where richie lifts weights,
     very much aware of his pariah status as out-of-shape cops               
     come in, only to leave again when they see him.


                                                                    (cont)

                                                                    40.

                  someone is finally saying: enough.
                  federal authorities have announced their
                  intention to establish special narcotics
                  bureaus in washington, new york, los
                  angeles, chicago, boston, newark and
                  other major cities -

     toback comes in, watches richie, alone, working out.

                               richie v/o
                  it's a dog and pony show.                                  

                               toback v/o
                  it's not being advertised as one.
