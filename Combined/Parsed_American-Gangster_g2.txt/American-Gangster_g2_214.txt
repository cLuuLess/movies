298   int. airport hanger office - minutes later - day             298

      richie and toback sit before the federal attorneys and
      customs agents. the us attorney hangs up a phone ... then:

                             us attorney
                that was a military transport plane. if
                there was heroin on board then someone in
                the military would have to be involved.
                which means that even as it fights a war
                that's claimed 50,000 americans lives,
                the military is smuggling narcotics.

      richie's in serious trouble and knows it.    as does toback.

                             us attorney
                that's how these events are being
                interpreted by general easton in that
                call to me. that someone employed by the
                this office believes the united states
                army is in the drug trafficking business -
                and is trying to prove it by desecrating
                the remains of young men who've given
                their lives in the defence of democracy.

                             richie
                there are drugs on that plane -

                             us attorney
                shut the fuck up.

      richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for
      these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act
      as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate
      organization of his world, his superiors.

                             us attorney
                is it any wonder then, because of your
                actions, the entire federal narcotics
                program is now in jeopardy of being
                dismantled as completely and enthusiastic-
                ally as that fucking transport plane?
                that's what you've accomplished mr.
                roberts. single-handedly.

                             richie
                i had good information the target of my
                investigation was bringing dope in on
                that plane.

                             us attorney
                and that target is?

                                                                 (cont)

                                  richie
                   frank lucas.

      no one in the room, except richie and toback, has ever
      heard the name. the federal men regard one another blankly.

                                us attorney
                   who?  who's frank lucas?
                          (no one seems to know)
                   who's he work for? which family?

                                richie
                   he's not italian. he's black.

      now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before -

                                us attorney
                   is that supposed to be some kind of joke?
                   you're this close to the end of your
                   career in law enforcement, you're making
                   jokes?

                                richie
                   i believe frank lucas is above the mafia
                   in the dope business. i believe he buys
                   direct from the source in southeast asia,
                   cuts out all the middlemen, and uses us
                   military planes and personnel to bring
                   pure no. 4 heroin into united states.

      richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make
      sense out of his ridiculous theory. toback tries to come to
      his defense -
                                toback
                   richie has a lot of experience -

                                us attorney
                   does he. and how many arrests has he
                   made in his so-called investigation?

                                richie
                   i was promised when i took this job, it
                   was about real arrests.

                                us attorney
                   does that mean `none?'

                                richie
                   i have cases against most of frank's
                   organization. not him -


                                                                    (cont)

                                     us attorney
                        no fucking nigger has accomplished what
                        the american mafia hasn't in a hundred
                        years!

                                     richie
                        yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having
                        never been on the (street) -

           richie goes for him and lands several punches before toback
           and the others can pull him off.

                        he was out of line, richie.

           richie isn't really listening. strides past his detectives
           on his way out of the building. to spearman -
                                      toback

       ana stares at the floor. it all just seems to get worse and
       worse. they had their chance to get out and missed it.

                                 frank
                    this - is his death warrant.

       frank glances to where his mother sits in the living room.
       nods to doc to say, get the car, i'll be out in a minute.
       goes over to his mother.

                                 mrs. lucas
                    sit down.

       he sits. she studies him in a way she hasn't since he was
       little. eventually -

                    if you'd have been a preacher, your
                    brothers would be preachers. if you'd
                    been a soldier, they'd be soldiers. do
                    you know that?
                           (he doesn't say)
                    they all came here because of you. you
                    called and they came running. they look
                    up to you. they expect you to always
                    know what's best.
                           (pause)
                    but even they know you don't shoot
                    cops. even i know that. ana knows it.
                    you seem to be the only one who doesn't.

                                 frank
                    is that where i'm going?

                                 mrs. lucas
                    i never asked you where all this came
                    from because i didn't want to hear you
                    lie to me. don't lie to me. don't do
                    that, too.

        frank has some trouble looking at her. but then gets up.
        walks toward the front door to leave. hesitates near it a
        long moment. then turns and walks upstairs. trupo will
        live, at least for now, because of her.
