      jimmy has thought about it all night and walks out of the
      building into the chilly morning air.

                   jimmy?   look at me -

      jimmy looks over his shoulder as if richie just called to
      him from it, which he didn't. there's no one in sight -

                                richie v/o
                   any time i want to change my mind? i
                   don't like the quality of your work? i
                   can find a witness saw you shoot your
                   girlfriend. it just took me a while. i
                   even know what he'll look like. he'll
                   look just like you.
