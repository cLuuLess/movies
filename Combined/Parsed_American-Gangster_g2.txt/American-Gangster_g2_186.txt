268   int. bamboo dwelling - opium farm - day                          268

      the same farm and hut as before. frank and the chinese
      general sip tea. the four million dollars in cash frank
      brought sits on the table.

                                general
                   opium plants are hearty enough to
                   outlive any war. they'll still be here
                   long after the troops are gone. but what
                   are you going to do for transportation
                   when the last us plane goes home?

                                frank
                   i'll figure something out.      you'll see
                   me again.
      the general seems fond of frank, and not only because of all
      the money on the table.

                                general
                   it's not in my best interest to say
                   this, frank ... but quitting while you're
                   ahead is not the same as quitting.

                                frank
                   that's what my wife thinks.

                                general
                   but you don't think she's right.

      frank doesn't say.

                                                                     102.
