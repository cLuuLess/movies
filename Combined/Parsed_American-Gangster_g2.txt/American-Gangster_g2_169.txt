       richie and laurie sit with their respective lawyers, waiting
       for the judge to appear. he leans over -

                                 richie
                    laurie. i'm sorry i couldn't give you
                    the kind of life you wanted. i'm sorry
                    it was never enough. but don't punish me
                    for being honest. don't take my son
                    away.

       she stares at him in disbelief.        then responds in a louder
       voice than his -



                                                                         (cont)

                                laurie
                   what are you saying? that because you
                   were "honest" and didn't take money like
                   every other cop, i left you?

      the bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care.

                                laurie
                   you don't take money for one reason:
                   to buy being dishonest about everything
                   else. and that's worse than taking money
                   nobody gives a shit about - drug money,
                   gambling money nobody's gonna miss.
                          (more people look over)
                   i'd rather you took it and been honest
                   with me. or don't take it, i don't care.
                   but don't then go cheat on me. don't
                   cheat on your kid by never being around.
                   don't go out and get laid by your
                   snitches and secretaries and strippers.
                   i can tell just by looking, she's one
                   of them.

      his lawyer.    which is true.    everyone's watching them now.

                                laurie
                   you think you're going to heaven because
                   your "honest." you're not. you're going
                   to the same hell as the crooked cops you
                   can't stand.

                                bailiff
                   all rise -
