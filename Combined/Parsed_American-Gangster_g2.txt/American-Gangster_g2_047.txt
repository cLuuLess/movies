      richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like
      it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at
      the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance.

                                richie
                   step back, injured man coming out. let
                   them do their job and he'll be all right.
                   ma'am. excuse me. step back. sir.
                   please.

      the people step back when they see the victim on the gurney:
      tubes in his nostrils, iv in his arm, eyes open. before they
      can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. as it pulls
      out, siren wailing, richie leads rivera safely away -

      they cross through an alley near the projects and rivera                  
      finally breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 rivera                                         
                   thank you -

      the words aren't out of his mouth before richie shoves him                
      up against a car.                                                         

                                richie
                   you robbed him, didn't you.


                                                                       (cont)

                   what?   what are you talking about?

      richie rips rivera's jacket pockets.        money spills out.             

                                 richie
                   this.   where'd this come from?

                                rivera                                          
                   what. that's my money. i've never
                   taken dirty money in my life.

                                richie
                   you lying piece of shit -

                                rivera                                          
                   maybe the occasional gratuity. like
                   anybody else. you're going to tell me
                   that's wrong?

                                 richie
                   yeah.

                                rivera                                          
                   no, it isn't. it's part of the salary
                   for getting shot at. for that, certain
                   courtesies are shown. in gratitude -                         

      richie, disgusted with him, lets go of him.         rivera is             
      embarrassed, almost crying, pleading -                                    

                                rivera                                          
                   a discount on a tv, a doughboy in the                        
                   backyard, a new dress for your girlfriend                    
                   maybe once a year. i'm talking about not                     
                   living in fucking poverty. you want to                       
                   call that wrong, call it wrong.

                                 richie                                         
                   it's wrong.                                                  

                                rivera                                          
                   then goddamn it, pay me fifty grand a                        
                   year, you son of a bitch. pay me what i
                   deserve for getting shot at. no? fine.
                   next time four guys come into your place
                   with sawed-off shotguns, you take care of
                   it.

                                richie
                   you robbed him, and then you shot him,
                   and i helped you get out of there. how
                   many more you shot?
                                                                       (cont)

        rivera suddenly tries to get tough -                                    

                                  rivera                                        
                     you know what, richie? fuck you, you
                     make that kind of accusation against your
                     own kind. and you know why.

        he takes out his car keys, turns to leave. comes past                   
        richie who grabs his arm and pushes the sleeve up exposing a            
        line of puncture scabs and scars.

                                  richie
                     you're a disgrace.

                                  rivera                                        
                     i'm a leper. because i listened to you
                     and turned in a million fucking dollars.
                     you know who'll work with me after that?
                     same as you. no one.

        richie squeezes rivera's hand around the car key.                       

                                  richie
                     don't look down there. look here.
                            (at richie's eyes)
                     you ever fuckin threaten me again, i'll
                     kill you.

        richie squeezes sander's hand so hard the car key cuts
        through the skin, drawing blood.
