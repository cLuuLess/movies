84   int. morgue - night                                              84

     a cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not tango - but
     rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and                
     toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict.

                  did you know his girlfriend? good-
                  looking girl. one of his informants.


                                                                    (cont)

                  beth.

     the medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer
     containing her body. richie stares at it.

                               detective
                  should've seen their place.    like animals
                  lived there.

                               richie
                  i have seen it.

                               detective
                         (to the examiner)
                  chose a good night, huh?   grand central
                  station in here.

                               medical examiner
                  it's been like this. i'm lucky i get
                  home before midnight; lots of careless-
                  ness.

     richie regards rivera's personal effects resting on his                 
     chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the corvette key, a half-
     empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. richie takes the
     blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes
     entombing sanders, holds it in his hand ...

                               reporter v/o
                  heroin addiction is no longer exclusive
                  to big city neighborhoods; it's epidemic -

85   time cut.    a television:                                       85
     the reports shows lawmakers on capitol hill juxtaposed
     against images of inner-cities, junkies, homicide victims
     and, perhaps most telling, white suburbia.

                               reporter on tv
                  since 1965, law enforcement has watched
                  its steady increase and with it a rise in
                  violent crime. now unaccountably, it has
                  exploded, reaching into cities as a whole
                  - our suburbs and towns - our schools.
