30   int. newark police station - later - night                    30

     as a police captain counts the stacks of money, lou toback,
     richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his
     night out interrupted by this emergency. he crossed to where
     richie and rivera sit alone in a corner. quietly:                    

                            toback
               how much.

                            richie
               nine hundred and eighty thousand.

                            toback
               what happened to the rest?

     it's a joke but isn't funny, not even to toback. he regards
     his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place -
     who are watching them and the money being counted. toback
     walks over to the captain, and, quietly:

                            toback
               what're you doing counting this in front                   
               of everybody? are you out of your fuckin
               mind? take it into a room. now.

     richie's glance to rivera says, you're right, we're fucked.          

31   int/ext. newark police station - pre-dawn                     31

     as richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him -
     knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect,
     but contempt and fear, like rivera predicted. neither will           
     ever be trusted again. he climbs into his car, drives off.
