     int.  sanatorium, white room -- afternoon

     a polaroid is on a white table.  it is the photo wild bill gave
     to mills and somerset.  it is a picture of a belt, made with
     extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the
     groin.  it is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic
     protuberance.  instead, there is a metal knife.  it is a strap-
     on butcher's knife.

     somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room.
     mills stands behind him.  the crazed man from the lust murder is
     in a chair across the room.  the crazed man is crying.

                                 crazed man
                   and... and... and he said... he asked if
                   i was married.  and, i could see he had
                   a gun in his hand.

                                 somerset
                   where was the girl?

                                 crazed man
                   what?  what?

                                 somerset
                   where was the prostitute?

                                 crazed man
                   she was... she was on the bed.  she was
                   just sitting on the bed.

                                 somerset
                   who tied her down?  you or him?

                                 crazed man
                   he had a gun.  he had a gun, and he made
                   it happen.  he made me do it!
                   he made me put it on... that thing.  oh,
                   god... he made me wear it.  he had the
                   gun in my mouth.

     the man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands.

                                 crazed man (cont)
                   the gun was in my throat.

     mills looks at the mirror in the room.

     somerset stands, picks up the polaroid as two men in white
     uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor.
