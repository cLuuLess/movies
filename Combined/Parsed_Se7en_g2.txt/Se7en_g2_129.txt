     ext.  mills' apartment building, rooftop -- night

     mills shoves the rooftop door open.  it creaks as it swings.

     mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop
     entrance, covering it with his gun.  he moves around, sees
     nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over.
