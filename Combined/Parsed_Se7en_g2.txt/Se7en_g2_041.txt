     int.  underground art gallery -- night

     a narrow room.  speed metal is even louder.  this is a private
     art party.  the people are lizard-like, pale.  men and women
     priding themselves on their gauntness.

     somerset passes canvases on the walls.  pointlessly abstract
     paintings.  splatters, smears and blobs of color.

     party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed.
     somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the
     tissue further in his ears.  he spots his objective.

     william mccracken, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers.  he is
     dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many
     colors of paint.  he wears dark sunglasses, bored by the
     bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.

     somerset worms his way to stand in front of william.  the party-
     goers turn their attention to this intrusion.

     william looks up, pushes the girl away.  he takes off his
     sunglasses.  his eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.

     he looks somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.
