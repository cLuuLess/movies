     int.  mills' apartment, bedroom -- night

     a small transistor radio plays on the bedside table.

     mills and tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets.  they
     move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard.

     mills holds tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as
     she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.

     mills' hair is soaked.  he is anything but mellow as a lover,
     quickening while tracy twists underneath him.  tracy holds tight
     to the back of his neck with one hand.

     finally, mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head
     down against tracy's chest.  holds for a long moment, till he is
     spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms.  he rests a
     long time.  she kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed.

     finally, mills rolls off her, gets behind her and wraps the both
     of them in the sheets.  he folds himself against her, and they
     stay that way.

                                 tracy
                   goodnight.

                                 mills
                   goodnight.

     after a long moment, mills shifts back, sits up.  tracy looks
     over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and
     stands.  mills wraps the towel around his waist.

     he leans over to give tracy a last kiss.  she watches him leave
     the room.  she is about to say something, but does not.  a light
     comes on in the other room, leaking through the door.
