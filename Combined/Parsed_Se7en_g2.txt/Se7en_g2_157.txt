     ext.  skyscraper rooftop -- late afternoon

     california is dressed in full battle gear.  he looks through
     binoculars at the city below.  the wind blows hard.

     he turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,
     climbs in the side door.  the pilot leans back from the cockpit
     to hand him a helmet.  california dons it, starts strapping
     himself in so he can lean out the open door.

                                 california
                   is this wind going to hurt us?

     the pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades
     start to spin, churning the air.

                                 pilot
                   just makes the ride a little more fun.

     california hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper
     lifts from the pad and takes off.
