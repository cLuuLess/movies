     ext.  cemetery -- later day

     the funeral is over.  somerset stands at the edge of the
     graveyard, looking at the distant city.  behind him, the
     mourners are still filing out to their cars.

     the captain approaches.  he comes to stand beside somerset,
     similarly solemn.

                                 captain
                   i don't know if i should do this.
                           (pause)
                   we found the motel room doe must have
                   been staying in after you found his
                   apartment.

     somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away.

                                 captain (cont)
                   anyway... we found this in his
                   belongings.

     the captain takes out a sealed envelope.  somerset takes it.

     on the envelope: detective somerset, handwritten, in red marker.
