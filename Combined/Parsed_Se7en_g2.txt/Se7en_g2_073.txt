     int.  slum tenement building, hallway -- morning

     the cops enter the dank hallway, the same hall we saw john in
     before.  they move cautiously, stepping over a drunken, helpless
     man.  a door opens and a woman peeks out.  the female cop points
     her gun and the woman obeys, slamming the door.

     california leads, steps up to apartment 303.  he has a search
     warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest.

                                 california
                           (to black cop)
                   this is it.  give it up.

     a black cop hoists a battering ram.  the other cops get on both
     sides of the door.  mills moves front.  somerset hangs back.

                                 california (cont)
                   police!!  open the door!

     the black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud.
     the door flies open.  the cops storm in.
