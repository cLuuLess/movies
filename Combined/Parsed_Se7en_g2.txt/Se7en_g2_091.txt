     ext.  abandoned church/orphanage -- afternoon

     a once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected.  gothic in
     style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of
     rubble as neighbors.  smokestacks spew smoke distantly.  cars
     and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here
     on the street it's a ghost town.

     there's a building attached to the rear of the church.
     somerset's car is parked beside it.
