     int.  apartment 604, bathroom -- night

     somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom.

     in the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a
     hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle
     of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor.

     somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub.  the tub and
     shower walls are splattered with blood.  the tub has a few
     inches of water in it.  the water is cloudy red and bits of
     gauze float in it.  somerset jiggles the drain's knob.

     some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.
