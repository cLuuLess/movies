     int.  precinct house, somerset's office -- early evening

     somerset and mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks.
     somerset is looking out the window.  mills stares at the wall.

     somerset looks to his temporary desk.  he picks up a small pile
     of mail, sorts through it.  an 8" by 10" manila envelope
     interests him.  it reads detective somerset on the outside,
     handwritten in red marker.  he opens it.

     he takes out a grainy photograph of he and tracy kissing in his
     car.  it's obviously been taken with a special night-lens.

     somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp.  he holds the photo to
     hide it from mills, looks to see mills has not noticed.  he
     feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand.
