     int.  indoor fruit stand -- night

     tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment.  she sighs again.

     mills passes the babbling strange man, comes up to tracy.

                                 mills
                   i'm sorry... i couldn't pass it up.  i
                   never had a chance to actually do that.
                   but, we can start the argument right
                   back up where we left off, right?

     tracy looks at him, charmed, no longer willing to fight.

                                 mills
                           (playing dumb)
                   what?

     tracy wraps an arm around mills and kisses him.  he holds her.

                                 strange man
                   that was the theme from tv's mod squad.
                   i'm surprised nobody got that one.

     the strange man starts humming a new tune.  an old man tries to
     get through the aisle where mills and tracy are kissing.

                                 old man
                           (infuriated)
                   excuse me.  excuse me!
