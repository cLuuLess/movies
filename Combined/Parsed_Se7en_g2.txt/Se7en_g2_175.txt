     ext.  industrial area, junk-yard -- night

     mills follows doe past rusting collections of machines.  we took
     this walk with doe before, through this metallic bone-yard.

                                 john doe
                   it's right this way.

     mills is on edge.  his eyes search the towering, twisted junk.
     sharp edges reach for the sky.  glass breaks under their feet.

                                 mills
                   so far, so good.

     sounds of boats on the river can be heard.  doe's heading for
     the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk-yard.

     doe nears the alleyway.  it is pitch dark.  doe stops before
     entering, turns to mills.

                                 john doe
                   in here.

     mills steps up, keeping his distance from doe.  he can't see a
     thing in the blackness ahead.

                                 mills
                   you go first.

     doe faces the alley.  he starts walking.  we move with him as he
     goes.  he's counting silently to himself, moving his lips.

     mills walks behind doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all
     directions.  he's about ten feet behind doe, keeping his gun
     trained on the back of doe's skull.

                                 mills (cont)
                   tell me where we're going.

     doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker.
