     int.  precinct house, ready room -- late afternoon

     mills has his shirt off.  a female technician, josie, tapes a
     radio transmitter and microphone to his chest.

     somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks.  he wears a
     bullet-proof vest, is just finishing a check of his gun.  he's
     putting the bullets back into it.

     josie finishes prepping mills.  mills presses the adhesive,
     making sure it will hold.  he puts on a shirt and bullet-proof
     vest, fastens the velcro.

     somerset stands, puts the gun in his hip holster.

     mills picks up his own gun, checks it, holsters it.  he watches
     somerset take out a roll of antacids.  somerset pops a few.

                                 somerset
                   ready?

                                 mills
                   extremely.

     they look at each other.  mills holds out his hand.  they shake
     on it.
