     int.  jazz club -- night

     a club at capacity.  the jazz music continues like a slow, cool
     breeze from a jazz trio on a platform.

     the air is thick with smoke.  yuppies sit elbow to elbow with
     the last members of the beat generation.  everyone's drinking
     beer, smoking pot.

     somerset crosses the club, looking for someone.  he takes a
     tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in
     his ears.  at the back of the club, a major-league bouncer
     stands in front of a closed door.  somerset shows his badge and
     the bouncer steps aside with reservation.
