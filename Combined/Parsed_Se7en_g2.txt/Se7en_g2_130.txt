     int.  mills' apartment, bedroom -- night

     mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up.  he
     looks at tracy asleep in the bed.  the room begins to rattle a
     little as a subway train is again passing underground.

     he walks to the window and checks the lock.  he halts.  he opens
     the window and reaches out.  the rattling is a bit louder.

     from the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles
     wrapped with a rubber band.  mills realizes, doe was here.
