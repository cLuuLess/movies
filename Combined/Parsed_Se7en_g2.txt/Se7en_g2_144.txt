     ext.  city streets, industrial area -- night

     john doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes.
     factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for
     miles.  we can hear tugboat horns sounding low and deep.  we're
     near the water.

     doe seems to know where he's going.  he passes stacks of
     industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.

     he walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed
     bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  it's like a
     stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.

     at the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow
     alleyway formed by two warehouses.  doe enters, looking up at
     the single lit bulb on the wall above.

     he looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap,
     walks under the bulb.  he throws the hubcap with all his might.
     it soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.

     doe takes aim with the rock.  he throws, grunting.

     the rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.

     doe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  he stops and turns to
     start from there.  he walks, deliberately, looking down at his
     feet.    follow as he walks.

     he stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the
     ground in front of him again.  he takes off his thick glasses.

     he holds the glasses in his hand.
