     ext.  warehouse alleyway -- night

     doe walks on.  mills is behind, walking to close the gap.  we
     can hear the faint sound of rushing water.

                                 mills
                   i'll blow your head off right now!

     doe stops abruptly.  he spins on his heels, facing mills.

     mills is getting closer, pumped, ready to pull the trigger.

     doe reaches up with his hands, takes off his glasses.  he holds
     them in one hand.  the sound of the water is louder.

     mills is about six feet from doe, and knows something's wrong.

     john doe smiles.

                                 mills (cont)
                   what...

     doe takes one step backwards and falls, straight down,
     disappears in the blink of an eye.

                                 mills (cont)
                   no!
