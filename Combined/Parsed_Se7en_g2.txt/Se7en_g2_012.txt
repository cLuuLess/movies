     ext.  tenement/city street -- day

     a body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement
     doors.  somerset follows.  mills follows somerset.  they walk
     towards the end of the filthy block.

                                  mills
                   i'm a little thrown.  i just finished
                   orientation at central, and they dumped
                   me off down here.

                                  somerset
                   i heard you brought in two small-timers
                   last night.

                                  mills
                   yeah.  two real idiots.

                                  somerset
                   since we are just starting out, i
                   thought we could go to a bar.  sit and
                   talk for awhile.  that way we can...

                                  mills
                   excuse me, but i'd rather start sniffing
                   for a case, if it's all the same to you.
                   seeing how we only have a week for this
                   whole transition thing.
                           (waits)
                   i want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,
                   know what i mean?

     somerset walks, no reply.  mills searches to get a read on him.

                                  somerset
                   i meant to ask you something... when we
                   spoke on the phone.  i can't help
                   wondering...
                           (pause)
                   why are you here?

                                  mills
                           (wary)
                   i... i don't follow.

                                  somerset
                   all this effort you've gone through, to
                   be transferred from philadelphia to
                   here.  it's the first question that pops
                   into my head.

     mills formulates his response.

                                  mills
                   i'm here for the same reasons as you, i
                   guess.  or... at least the same reasons
                   you used to have for being here...
                           (cutting)
                   ...before you decided to give up.

     somerset stops and faces mills.

                                  somerset
                   you think you know me?  you just met me
                   two minutes ago.

                                  mills
                   maybe i don't understand the question.

                                  somerset
                   it's very simple.  you've come from the
                   "city of brotherly love" to the "city of
                   brotherly hate," detective.  i've never
                   seen it done that way.

                                  mills
                   i don't know.  maybe i thought i could
                   do more good here than there.
                           (pause)
                   you know, it'd be great by me if we
                   didn't start right out kicking each
                   other in the balls.  but, you're calling
                   the shots, lieutenant, so however you
                   want it to go.

                                  somerset
                   let me tell you how i want this to go.
                   i want you to look, and i want you to
                   listen.

                                  mills
                   i wasn't standing around philly guarding
                   the fucking liberty bell.

                                  somerset
                   but, you've never worked homicide in
                   this city.

                                  mills
                   i realize that.

                                  somerset
                   well, please do me the favor of
                   remembering it.

     mills just stares back at somerset.  somerset walks.  mills
     rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd i do to deserve
     this?"  he follows somerset.
