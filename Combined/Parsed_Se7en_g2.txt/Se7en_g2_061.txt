     int.  safe house -- night

     the room is like a bland hotel room.  mills stands beside mrs
     gold.  he shows her photos from the murder scene.  mrs. gold is
     crying.  somerset stands across the room.

                                 mills
                   please, look for anything strange or out
                   of place.  anything at all.

                                 mrs gold
                   i... i don't understand.  why now?

     mills helps her go through the photos.  he is shaken himself,
     not wanting to put her through this.

                                 mills
                   i need your help if we're going to get
                   the guy who killed your husband.  if
                   there's anything in these pictures...

     mrs. gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears.

                                 mrs gold
                   i don't see anything.

                                 mills
                   are you absolutely sure?

                                 mrs gold
                   i can't do this now... please.

     mills looks at somerset.  somerset holds other photos.

                                 mills
                   we have to show her those.  there might
                   be something she's missing.

     somerset looks at the photos in his hand, hesitant.  these
     photos show mr. gold's corpse, not covered in any way.

                                 somerset
                   have her look one last time.

                                 mrs gold
                   wait.  here... here's something...

                                 mills
                   what is it?

     mrs. gold points at the constructivist painting on the wall in
     one photo.  the painting is an abstraction of colored squares.

                                 mrs gold
                   this painting... in the living room...

                                 mills
                   what?

                                 mrs gold
                   why is it hanging upside-down?

     mills jerks his head to look at somerset.  big score.
