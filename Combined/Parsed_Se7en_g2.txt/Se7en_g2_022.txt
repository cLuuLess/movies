     int.  indoor fruit stand -- night

     the front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy
     sidewalk and street.  a transparent plastic canopy frames the
     entrance.  a strange man, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy.
     he wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious.

     tracy and mills look together over the piles of fruits and
     vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles.

                                 mills
                   it was okay.  i mean... it was certainly
                   better than yesterday.  i think somerset
                   and i came to a small understanding...

     mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch
     apart to illustrate.

                                 mills (cont)
                   ...about this big.

                                 tracy
                   he sounds interesting.

                                 mills
                   he is that, if nothing else.

     mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from tracy's
     arm.  he goes to check out the carrots.  tracy looks up from
     heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance.

     the strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes
     glassy.  customers come and go, paying him no mind.

     mills notices tracy's interest.  he keeps comparing carrots.

                                 mills (cont)
                   we started a big homicide case today.
                   i'll spare you the grisly details.

     the strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store
     with a crooked grin.

                                 strange man
                   name that tune?  anybody name that tune?
                   name that tune...

     the man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored.

                                 tracy
                   it's... it's like they emptied all the
                   insane asylums into the streets.

     she looks back to the heads of lettuce.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   that's what it's like.  like they just
                   gave up, and let everyone out.

     mills nods, his back to tracy.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   there are a lot of frightening people in
                   this city.

                                 mills
                   there are a lot of frightening people in
                   the world.

     tracy looks again to the strange man.

                                 strange man
                   name that tune?  anybody name that tune?

                                 tracy
                   it seems worse than philadelphia,
                   because everything is pushed right up
                   against you.  in your face.

     mills edges past tracy towards the front of the store, tries to
     be pleasant.

                                 mills
                   listen, honey.  i don't want to fight
                   tonight.  okay?  can we just go one
                   night without fighting about something?

     he looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that.

                                 tracy
                   i'm not trying to start a fight.
                           (pause)
                   how am i trying to start a fight?

                                 mills
                   we're here now.  okay.  are we supposed
                   to pack it all in and go back?  how are
                   we going to do that?

                                 tracy
                   do i have to act like i love this place?
                   is that what a "good wife" would do?

                                 mills
                           (doleful)
                   there's a lot of pressure on me... i...

                                 tracy
                   and, there's a lot of pressure on me.
                   i'm here with you.

                                 mills
                   i know.  i know...

     mills steps towards the open air entrance.  he's watching
     something.  the strange man is still heard offscreen.

     tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of
     rice, her back to mills.

                                 tracy
                   i'm not going to close my eyes and block
                   everything out, david.  i'm not going to
                   act like you delivered us to some sort
                   of paradise.  i can't...

     she gets the rice and turns.  mills is not there.  she sighs,
     angry, looks around.  she walks towards the entrance and sees
     him --

     tracy's p.o.v. -- the street

     in front of the stand, mills has run to the corner of the
     sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane.  the elderly
     woman smiles up at mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the
     curb and across the street.  he talks to her as they go.
