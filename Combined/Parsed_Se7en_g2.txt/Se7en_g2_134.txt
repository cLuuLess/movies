     int.  wild bill's leather shoppe -- afternoon

     somerset's holding up the composite sketch of john doe.

                                 wild bill (o.s.)
                   yeah, he was here.  this morning.

     mills and somerset are across the sales counter from wild bill,
     37.  wild bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos.  a thick scar
     runs down his forehead to his bent nose.  leather belts, whips
     and jackets hang from the walls.

                                 mills
                   it was definitely him?  you're positive?

                                 wild bill
                   yeah.  john doe.  easy name to remember.

                                 somerset
                   what was this job you did for him?

     wild bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.

                                 wild bill
                   i got a picture of it.  that's what he
                   came for this morning.  i figured he
                   must be one of those art guys... like
                   those guys who piss in a cup and drink
                   it on stage.  performance art.

     wild bill gives a polaroid to mills.  we don't see the image.

                                 mills
                   oh, fuck...

                                 wild bill
                   i think i undercharged him.  i was up
                   all night working to finish it.

                                 somerset
                           (looks at photo)
                   you built this for him?  you built this?

                                 wild bill
                   i've built weirder shit than that.

     a beel chimes as a policeman enters the store.

                                 policeman
                   somerset... we have a situation.

     mills and somerset follow the policeman out.

                                 wild bill
                   hey, my picture!

     they're gone.  wild bill scratches his scar.

                                 wild bill (cont)
                   fucking pigs.
