     int.  precinct house, somerset's office -- early morning

     the chalkboard:            1 gluttony (x)      5 lust
                                2 greed (x)         6 envy
                                3 sloth (x)         7 wrath
                                4 pride (x)

     somerset is seated, holding the photo of the lust painting from
     the tableau.  mills is behind his own desk.  they both look like
     they haven't gotten much sleep.

                                 mills
                   there's two people in that painting.
                   so, maybe he's planning to kill two
                   people this time.  maybe.

     mills looks at somerset, who doesn't seem to be listening.

                                 mills (cont)
                   what's wrong this morning?

                                 somerset
                   nothing.  sorry.

     somerset looks up, sips from a cup of coffee, looks at the
     photo.  mills swings his chair, looks out the window at the
     morning light on the billboard.

                                 mills
                   lust is next.  lust is sex.

                                 somerset
                   apples on the floor.  original sin.

                                 mills
                   adam and eve.

     somerset puts the photo down, leans back, takes out a cigarette.

                                 mills (cont)
                   sex, sex, sex.  fucking sex.

                                 somerset
                   lust is everywhere.  that's the hard
                   part.  i think lust is the most
                   prevalent sin, even more than greed.

     somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette.  he gets up
     to stretch his legs.

     mills picks up the lust photo, puts his feet up on the desk.

                                 mills
                   lust is red.

     long pause.

                                 somerset
                   bright red.

                                 mills
                   blood red.

                                 somerset
                   red sky at night, sailor's delight.

                                 mills
                   red blooded.  red head.  dead.

                                 somerset
                   red light district.

     pause.  realization.  somerset and mills look at each other.

                                 mills
                   that would make sense.

                                 somerset
                   it would be fitting.

                                 mills
                   you're damn right it would.

     mills picks up the phone.
