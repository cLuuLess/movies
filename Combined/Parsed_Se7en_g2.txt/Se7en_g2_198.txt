     ext.  mills' apartment building -- day

     tracy and somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the
     apartment building.  movers carry tracy's belongings to the
     truck.  mills' car is attached to be towed behind.

                                 somerset
                   i wish i could say something...
                           (pause)
                   something to... i don't know...

                                 tracy
                   i'll be okay.

     somerset nods.

                                 somerset
                   we'll keep in touch.  i'll come visit.

                                 tracy
                   i'll write to you when we get there.

                                 somerset
                   take care of yourself.
                           (pause)
                   take care of the baby.

     tracy nods.  there's nothing left for them to say.  they're both
     empty.  it's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,
     to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.

                                 mover
                   that's all, mrs. mills.  we got
                   everything.

     movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs
     in and fires up the engine.

                                 somerset
                   goodbye, tracy.

                                 tracy
                   goodbye, somerset.

     somerset walks away.  tracy walks away, gets in the passenger
     side of the moving truck.
