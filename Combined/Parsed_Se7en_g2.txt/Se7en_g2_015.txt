     int.  mills' apartment, living room/kitchenette -- early morning

     across a living room full of boxes, tracy mills, 30, a beautiful
     woman, stands in her bathrobe.  she's upset about something,
     takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.

     she pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea
     from a pot on the stove.  blowing on the steaming tea, she leans
     back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.

     the tea is too hot to sip, and as tracy is placing the mug on
     the counter behind her the phone rings.  startled, she releases
     the mug too close to the edge.  it falls --

     crashes to the floor, shatters.
