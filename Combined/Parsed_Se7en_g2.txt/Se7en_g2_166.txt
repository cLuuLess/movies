     int.  somerset's car -- late afternoon

     traffic is bumper to bumper.  somerset moves his headset
     mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette.  he steers onto the bridge,
     under the massive girders.

                                 mills (v.o.)
                           (from receiver)
                   for us to go pick up two more dead
                   bodies, and have that be the end of
                   it... just seems too boring for you.
