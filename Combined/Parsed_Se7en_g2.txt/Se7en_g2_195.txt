     int.  abandoned church -- night

     the seven deadly sin tableau burns.

     flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken.  gluttony, greed
     and sloth are already halfway gone.

     flames eat at pride, lust.

     wrath and envy are being consumed.  wrath goes last.  a man with
     bloodied hands, in tones of blue.  flames devour it.
