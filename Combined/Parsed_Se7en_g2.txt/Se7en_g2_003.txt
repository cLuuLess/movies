     ext.  old house -- day

     birds sing.  somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.

                                 man's voice (o.s.)
                   is something wrong?

     somerset does not respond. the man, in an ill-fitting real
     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty ford
     thunderbird.  he holds a check and a booklet of receipts.

                                 man (cont)
                   is something the matter?

                                 somerset
                   no... no.  there's nothing wrong.

     somerset still seems distant.

                                 man
                           (writes receipt)
                   not that it's any of my business... but,
                   are you figuring on moving out here
                   eventually?

                                 somerset
                   soon.

                                 man
                   i just never seen a man mortgaging an
                   empty house before.

                                 somerset
                   everything here still seems... seems so
                   strange to me.  all this.

                                 man
                   i don't know.  i'd say this place is
                   about as normal as places get.

     the man walks over to hand over a receipt.  somerset accepts the
     receipt, folds it.  somerset smiles.

                                 somerset
                   that is exactly what i mean.  strange.

     somerset looks back at the house.  the man does not understand.
