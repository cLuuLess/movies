     int.  old house -- day

     sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than
     bright.  somerset, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty
     second-story room.  he looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn
     wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.

     somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled
     away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  he runs his finger
     across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.
     he pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.

     he pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a
     roughly squared section with the rose at its center.

     he studies it in his hand.
