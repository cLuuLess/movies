     int.  slum tenement building, hallway -- night

     john comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall.
     the walls are graffitied.  the soiled floor is wet in spots.
     arguments and loud children are heard from behind closed doors.
     john comes to apartment 303.  he's winded from the climb.  he
     takes out keys, lets himself in.  closes the door.
