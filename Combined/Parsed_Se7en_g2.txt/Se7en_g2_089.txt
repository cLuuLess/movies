     int.  inner city cloister, stone's room -- afternoon

     the door is unlocked and opened by the nun.  somerset enters and
     bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door.  it's dark.

     father stone, 73, is in a wheelchair.  feeble and frail, eyes
     sunken in their sockets.  he looks up at somerset.

                                 somerset
                   father stone.  i'm a policeman.  i'd
                   like to ask you a few questions, if it's
                   alright?

     the whites of stone's eyes have yellowed.  he seems to nod.
     somerset sits on a stool, close.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   i want to ask you about the seven deadly
                   sins.

                                 stone
                   the sins.

                                 somerset
                   yes, father.

     stone reaches out a hand to touch somerset's face.  stone's
     extremely long fingernails trail against somerset's cheek and
     somerset tries to hide his revulsion.

                                 stone
                   are you one of mine?

                                 somerset
                   i don't...

                                 stone
                   are you saved?  do you have god?

                                 somerset
                   i... i need to ask about the sins.  do
                   you understand what i'm saying?

     stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.

                                 stone
                   are you a sinner?

     stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.

                                 stone (cont)
                   there are sinners here.  even here.
                   and, pain waits for them.  hell is
                   hungry for them.

     stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.

                                 stone (cont)
                   they don't realize... they don't know.
                           (pause)
                   fuck them all!

     somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of stone's jagged
     voice.  the nun goes to place a comforting hand on stone's
     shoulder.  stone is beginning to cry.

                                 nun
                           (to somerset)
                   they shouldn't have let you disturb him.
                   this shouldn't have been allowed.

                                 stone
                   where are the children?
                           (much louder)
                   where are the children?!
