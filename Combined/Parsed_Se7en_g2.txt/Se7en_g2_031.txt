     int.  luxury apartments, hallway -- morning

     a marble hallway.  a detective, 50, nervously chewing his nails,
     quickly leads mills and somerset past cops and forensics.

                                 detective
                   i said to myself, i'm not going to screw
                   around with this.  nope.  fuck that.
                   it's still pretty fresh meat.  i called
                   the medical examiner... he's coming.
                           (stops at door)
                   when i got to it, i knew.  as soon as i
                   laid eyes on it, i knew...

     the detective opens the door.  follow somerset and mills --
