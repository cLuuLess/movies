     int.  john doe's apartment building, stairwell -- night

     up the stairwell, several forensics are collecting shell
     casings, putting them in bags.  the casings are scattered all
     the way up the stairs.  one forensic walks up beside a cop.

                                 one forensic
                   i hear he's running around with an uzi
                   in one hand and a book of poetry in the
                   other.

                                 cop
                   a real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?

     at the top of the stairs, two forensics, sarah and billy, wait
     behind mills and somerset.  surgical gloves on all hands.  mills
     kicks at the door to apartment 3a with all his might.  again.
