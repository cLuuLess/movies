     int.  apartment/crime scene, hallway -- morning

     a dark hall.  somerset and mills stand with officer davis, 28, a
     beefy, uniformed cop.  light from a camera's flash spills in
     from the nearby kitchen.  davis hands somerset two flashlights.

                                 somerset
                   at what time did you confirm the death?

                                 davis
                   like i said, we didn't touch anything,
                   but we were on scene at like o-five-
                   hundred, so he's had his face in a plate
                   of spaghetti for about half an hour.

                                 mills
                   wait, wait, wait.  you didn't check him?
                   you didn't check vital signs?

                                 davis
                   believe me, he's gone.  unless he's
                   breathing spaghetti sauce now.

                                 mills
                   no.  the point is, when you're first man
                   in, you check vital signs.

                                 davis
                   this guy's sitting in a pile of his own
                   shit and piss.  if he ain't dead he
                   would have stood up by now.

                                 mills
                           (getting angry)
                   listen, godzilla...

     somerset steps in, heads mills off.

                                 somerset
                   thank you, officer davis.  we'll see you
                   again after we've had a look.

                                 davis
                   yes, sir.

     davis leaves, eyeing mills.  mills watches him.  somerset hands
     mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.

                                 somerset
                   i wonder what exactly was the point of
                   the conversation you were about to get
                   into?

                                 mills
                   and, i wonder how many times officer
                   davis there has found a supposedly dead
                   man who didn't really die until davis
                   was back in the patrol car calling the
                   morgue and eating a powdered donut.

     somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.

                                 somerset
                   drop it.  we have more important
                   concerns just now, don't we?

                                 mills
                   fine... for now.
