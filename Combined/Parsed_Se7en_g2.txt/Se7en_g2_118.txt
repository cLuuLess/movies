     int.  somerset's car -- night

     somerset puts the car in park.  tracy sits for a long time, then
     turns to face somerset.

                                 tracy
                   you've lived here for so long, somerset.
                   you know this city.  i...

     tracy can't quite figure how to put it.

                                 somerset
                   it's a hard place, tracy.

                                 tracy
                   when david and i lived in philadelphia,
                   we could afford to live on the
                   outskirts.  but now...
                           (pause)
                   i hate it here.  i feel scared, and i
                   feel sick and... i hate it.

     tracy wants to laugh, like it's silly, but can't pull it off.

                                 somerset
                   you have to put blinders on sometimes.
                   most times.  but, keep in mind, tracy,
                   like tonight, there are small pockets of
                   sanity.  some bars and bookstores.
                   museums.  several last vestiges of
                   civilization.
