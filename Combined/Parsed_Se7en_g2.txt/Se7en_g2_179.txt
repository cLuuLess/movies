     int.  warehouse alleyway -- night

     mills stands facing the open manhole cover doe disappeared into.

     a torrent of water rushes by underground.  mills fires a few
     futile shots into the water, out of his mind with rage.  he
     pulls back the top of his bullet-proof vest, exposing the
     microphone.

                                 mills
                   he's gone, somerset!  he's in the water!
