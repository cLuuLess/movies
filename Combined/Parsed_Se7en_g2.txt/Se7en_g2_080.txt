     int.  slum tenement building, stairwell -- morning

     mills and somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs.
     they are both highly agitated.

                                 somerset
                   the way this has gone, i didn't think it
                   was possible, but we may have
                   underestimated this guy.  the type of
                   intestinal fortitude it must take... to
                   keep a man bound for a full year.  to
                   sever his hand and use it to plant
                   fingerprints.

                                 mills
                   i want him bad.  i don't just want to
                   catch him anymore.  i want to hurt him.

                                 somerset
                   listen... we have to divorce ourselves
                   from our emotions here.  we have to keep
                   focusing on the small details.

                                 mills
                   i don't know about you, somerset, but i
                   feed off my emotions.

                                 somerset
                   he'll string us along all the way if
                   we're not careful.

     mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger.  somerset
     grabs him by the jacket.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   are you listening to me?!

     mills pushes somerset's hand off.

                                 mills
                   i hear you.

     there is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the sound of a
     camera advancing.  mills and somerset look --

     down the stairs, john is posing as a reporter.  he has his
     camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives.

                                 john
                   say cheese.

     he takes another picture, flashbulb flashing.  mills charges
     downwards, grabs john by his wrinkled clothing.

                                 mills
                   what the fuck are you doing?

     john squirms, holds up a laminated press identification pass.

                                 john
                   i have a right, officer.  i...

     mills shoves him and john stumbles a few steps, then falls to
     the landing below with a thud.  his glasses fly off.

                                 mills
                   that doesn't mean anything.  this is a
                   closed crime scene now!

     somerset steps down and pulls mills back.  john stands.

                                 john
                   you can't do this!  you can't...

                                 mills
                   get the fuck out of here!

     john gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight.

                                 john (o.s.)
                   the public has a right to know!

     somerset yanks mills harder, till mills sits on the stairs.

                                 mills
                   how do those cockroaches get here so
                   quick?

                                 somerset
                   they pay cops for the inside scoop, and
                   they pay well.  you can hate them, but
                   you better give them something, or
                   they'll make it all up.

                                 mills
                           (calming)
                   i'm sorry... i just...

                                 somerset
                   oh, it's alright.  it's always
                   impressive to see a man feeding off his
                   emotions.
