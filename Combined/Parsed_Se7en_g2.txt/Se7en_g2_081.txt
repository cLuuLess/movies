     int.  hospital room -- day

     mills stands with the blase dr. beardsley, who reviews a medical
     chart on a clipboard.  zero lies inside an oxygen tent with
     tubes running into him.  the room is dark.

                                 beardsley
                   a year of immobility seems about right,
                   judging by the deterioration of the
                   muscles and spinal cord.  blood tests
                   show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his
                   system.  heroin... crack... even an
                   antibiotic which was administered to
                   keep the bed sores from infecting.

     mills looks into the oxygen.

                                 mills
                   he hasn't said anything, or tried to
                   express himself in any way?

                                 beardsley
                   even if his brain were not mush, which
                   it is... he chewed his own tongue off a
                   long time ago.

     mills winces, moves away from the bed.

                                 mills
                   there's no way he'll survive?

                                 beardsley
                   detective, he'd die right now of shock
                   if you were to shine a flashlight in his
                   eyes.
