     ext.  john doe's apartment building, rear -- early evening

     mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard.  he sees
     a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks
     all directions.  his eyes are wild.  his gun hand is shaking.

     the courtyard is surrounded by alleyways.  the shooter could
     have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight.  somerset comes out,
     face wet with sweat.  mills holsters his gun.

                                 mills
                   are you alright?  are you okay?

                                 somerset
                   yeah.  i think so.

     they look at each other for a long time.  both realizing they
     came very close to dying.
