     int.  mills' apartment, bedroom -- later night

     mills and tracy are asleep in their bed.  mills' eyes shift
     under their lids.  rapid eye movement.

     a sound is heard from the other room.  mills awakens.  he lays
     still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun
     off the bedside table.  he grabs his pants from a chair, slides
     into them.
