     int.  underground waterworks -- night

     water roars.  a square pool of water churns.  a moment, then
     mills rises, gasping, choking.  he's disoriented, furious,
     waving his gun, expecting doe to be right on top of him.

     no one around.  mills looks.  this is some sort of unmanned
     water switching station.  the walls are covered in catwalks,
     drainage pipes and tunnels.  some tunnels and pipes spew water
     down into the central pool, others are sealed shut.

     mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete
     spillway.  he stands up, searching.  doe could be anywhere.

                                 mills
                   come on, johnny!  i'm right here!
