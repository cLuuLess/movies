     int.  precinct house, observation room -- day

     mills, somerset and the captain stand in darkness.

     on the other side of a two-way mirror, john doe is seated in a
     restraining chair in an interrogation room.  his hands and legs
     are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs.  a
     strap hold tight around doe's throat.  this is not some
     superman/serial killer.  he looks more like an eccentric college
     professor.  his lawyer mark swarr, 43, sits at a table, taking
     notes.

     mills holds a fingerprint card.  the black ink prints are just
     useless blobs with traces of blood in them.

                                 captain
                   he cuts off the skin of his fingertips.
                   that's why we can't find a single usable
                   print in his apartment.  for a long
                   time, he's been cutting before the
                   papillary lines can grow back.

                                 mills
                   what about the trace on his bank
                   account?  the guns?

                                 captain
                   the orphanage is all we have.  his bank
                   account is only five years old and it
                   started as cash.  there's no credit
                   history, no employment history.  we even
                   tried to trace his furniture.  all we
                   know for sure is he's wealthy, well
                   educated and totally insane.  we may
                   never know how he got that way.

     somerset stands looking in at doe.

                                 somerset
                   because he is john doe, by choice.

                                 mills
                   when do we get to question him?

                                 captain
                   you don't.  this goes to court now.

                                 mills
                   this doesn't make sense, captain.  he
                   wouldn't just turn himself in!

                                 captain
                   well, there he sits.  it's not supposed
                   to make sense.

                                 mills
                   he's not finished!

                                 captain
                   you're wound way too tight on this,
                   mills.

                                 mills
                   somerset... help me out here.

     somerset looks at them.  says nothing.

                                 captain
                   it's over.

     the captain leaves.  mills is furious.

                                 mills
                   damn it, somerset.  you know johnny's
                   fucking with us.  he's pissing in our
                   faces again!

                                 somerset
                   slow up.  you and i are, probably for
                   the first time ever, in total agreement.
                   he wouldn't just stop.

                                 mills
                   well... what the fuck, man?

                                 somerset
                   john doe's only two murders away from
                   finishing his masterpiece, right?  but,
                   can you even conceive of what might
                   happen next?  i mean, can you tell me
                   how he's going to go about it?

                                 mills
                           (pause)
                   no.

                                 somerset
                   i can tell you this; i recognize his
                   lawyer.  his name is mark swarr.  he's
                   the one who kept zero out of prison.
                           (pause)
                   we'll wait for john doe's plea.
