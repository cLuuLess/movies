     int.  william's studio/apartment -- later night

     color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing
     table.  the top photos are like establishing shots, each taking
     in the entire display the murderer created.

     william examines with somerset looking over his shoulder.

                                 william
                   man... can i buy these from you?

                                 somerset
                   they're not for sale.

     somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle:

                                 somerset (cont)
                   what is it?  what's the murderer trying
                   to say?

     william narrows his eyes.  does not know.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   what picture is he painting?

                                 william
                           (figuring)
                   wait a minute...

     william has an idea.  he ambles over to a row of cabinets where
     oversized art books are stacked.  he hunts through a pile,
     shoves some books aside.

                                 william (cont)
                   i... i've seen things like that...

                                 somerset
                   where?

     william keeps digging, finds one book, finds another.  he opens
     one as he walks back to the drawing table.

                                 william
                   it's church stuff.  christianity.

     william lays a book down, finds a page.  he opens it to
     somerset.  there is a circle to the side of the text.  it says
     gluttony under the circle.

     somerset creases his brow, turns the page.  william opens
     another book.

                                 william (cont)
                   when it first started... christian
                   artwork was all from bible stories.  it
                   was like... nobody had any imagination.
                   it was all... standardized.

     william pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre,
     worlds of hieronymus bosch.  horrifying religious visions.

                                 william (o.s.,cont)
                   but, later, everyone started painting to
                   tell their own stories... to teach
                   lessons.  guys like bosch, bregel the
                   elder... van eycks.

     william shoves the open book to somerset.  somerset looks:

     seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving
     in to sins.  wicked, grotesque people.

     somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up.

                                 somerset (o.s.)
                   the seven deadly sins.

                                 william (o.s.)
                   that's what these murders remind me of.
                   paintings like these.
                           (points)
                   gluttony... greed...

                                 somerset (o.s.)
                   envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth.
                   seven deadly sins.

                                 william
                   amen, brother.

     william goes to continue pulling other books.

                                 william (cont)
                   i can find more examples.  there's lots
                   of paintings like those... painted over
                   hundreds of years.
                           (moves books)
                   and you're right... that murderer is an
                   artist.

     somerset is chilled by all this, immersed in the bosch book.

                                 somerset
                   and, it's two down... five to go.
