     int.  bookstore -- later night

     shelves and empty aisles of books.  classical music still plays.

                                 somerset (o.s.)
                   the irony is, that after a day of the
                   type of work he did, he'd come home and
                   read me these morbid crime stories.  le
                   fanu's green tea.  murders in the rue
                   morgue.

     move to the aisle marked mystery, where somerset and tracy are
     leaning against shelves.  they both hold books they've selected.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   my mother would give him hell... because
                   i was young, and he was keeping me up
                   till all hours, giving me nightmares.

                                 tracy
                   sounds like a father who wanted his son
                   to follow in his footsteps.

                                 somerset
                   one birthday, he gave me a hardcover
                   book called the century of the
                   detective, by jurgen thorwald.  it
                   traced the history of detection as a
                   science and it sealed my fate.  because
                   it was real, and that a drop of blood or
                   a piece of hair could solve a crime...
                   was incredible to me.

     a clerk looks down the aisle, then walks on.

                                 clerk (o.s.)
                   we're closing up, somerset.

                                 somerset
                   okay, thanks.

                                 tracy
                   david's going to wonder where i am.

                                 somerset
                   i'll give you a ride.

                                 tracy
                   no.  please, don't bother.

                                 somerset
                   i have to insist.  if your husband found
                   out i let you ride the subway at this
                   hour he'd tear my head off.

     they make their way out of the aisle.  somerset chuckles.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   i mean, literally.
