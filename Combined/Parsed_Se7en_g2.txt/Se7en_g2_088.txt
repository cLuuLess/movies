     int.  inner city cloister, hallway -- afternoon

     the walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints.
     bleeker whispers to somerset beside a windowless door.

                                 bleeker
                   there was a small orphanage attached to
                   the church, overseen by father stone.
                   this was almost thirty years ago.
                           (hesitant)
                   he was an excellent priest, devoted in
                   every way.  many in his parish demanded
                   his return.

                                 somerset
                   tell me what happened.

     bleeker sees a nun down the hall, coming towards them.

                                 bleeker
                   allegations were made... stone was
                   accused of abusing the children in his
                   care.  but, those charges were never
                   substantiated.

                                 somerset
                   what abuse?

                                 bleeker
                   it was claimed... that the children were
                   beaten.  and, punished severely.

     the nun is too close for bleeker to speak freely.
