     int.  mills' apartment, bedroom -- early morning

     it is barely becoming light outside.  mills can't sleep.

     alone in a double bed.  he sits up, frustrated.  sits on the
     edge of the bed and looks around.  the room is a shambles,
     filled with moving boxes.

     the light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy
     on one box.  large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen
     motion at the trophy's pinnacle.

     mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.
     the clinking of dishes and silverware is heard from another
     room.  mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.
