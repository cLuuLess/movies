     int.  abandoned orphanage, classroom -- afternoon

     the windows are covered over.  somerset and father bleeker move
     through.  somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam.  the room
     is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a
     few file cabinets.  there are cracked blackboards on the walls.
     rats skitter away from the light.

     somerset opens a file cabinet drawer.  it's empty.  he walks to
     a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.

                                 bleeker
                   what are you looking for?

                                 somerset
                   i'm just looking.
