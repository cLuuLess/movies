     int.  inner city cloister -- afternoon

     a monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting father bleeker
     and somerset into a garden courtyard.  bleeker now wears his
     priestly garb and collar.  the monastery's main building looms
     at the end of a pathway.  the building is stately, ivy-covered.

                                 bleeker
                   father stone had a church and
                   congregation of his own.  but, he...
                   there were some problems.  the church is
                   deserted now.

                                 somerset
                   problems?

     bleeker continues walking.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   father?
