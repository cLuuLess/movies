     ext.  abandoned church -- late afternoon

     somerset and mills exit down the stairs.  somerset's still
     searching, holding the list.  he spies a uniformed cop, dario.

                                 somerset
                   dario!  come here.

     dario runs up.  somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
     him walk with him.  mills continues on to his car.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   according to the father, this orphanage
                   wasn't around for more than five or six
                   years in the late fifties.  so, i want
                   someone to go to the department of child
                   welfare or city hall and dig up all the
                   records on this place.  understand?

                                 dario
                   i got it.

                                 somerset
                   get a list of every child who attended
                   this orphanage before it shut down.  get
                   it on my desk within the hour.

     somerset releases dario, who runs to obey.  somerset goes to his
     own car.  mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.
     somerset hands the computer list through the window.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   you thought of this all by yourself?
                   this was your brainstorm?

                                 mills
                   yeah.  is that so hard for you to
                   believe?

                                 somerset
                   it's a pleasant surprise.

                                 mills
                   i'm not as stupid as i look.

     mills peels away.  somerset heads to his own car.

                                 somerset
                           (to himself)
                   i guess not.
