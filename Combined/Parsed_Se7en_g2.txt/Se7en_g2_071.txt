     int.  mills' car -- morning

     mills drives, follows a police van.  somerset rides shotgun.
     mills is pumped, ready.  somerset takes one rolaids tablet off a
     fresh roll and chews it.

                                 mills
                   you ever take one?

     somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load.

                                 somerset
                   no.  never in twenty-four years.  i took
                   my gun out only five times with the
                   actual intention of using it.  i never
                   fired it.  not once.

                                 mills
                   i pulled it once, fired it once.  i
                   never took a bullet.

                                 somerset
                   and?

     mills turns a corner, tires screeching.

                                 mills
                   it was my first one of these.  we were a
                   secondary unit, in vice.  i was pretty
                   shaky going in.  when we busted the
                   door, looking for a junkie, the fucking
                   guy opened fire.  one cop was hit in the
                   arm.  he went flying... like in slow
                   motion.
                           (pause)
                   i remember riding in the ambulance.  his
                   arm was like... a piece of meat.  i
                   thought, it's just his arm.  but, he
                   bled to death right there anyway.

     a pause.  somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face.

                                 somerset
                   how did the fire-fight end?

                                 mills
                   well, i was doing really good in philly
                   up till then.  lots of simple busts.
                   i've always had this weird luck... but,
                   this was wild.
                           (pause)
                   i got that fuck with one shot... right
                   between the eyes.  and the next week,
                   the mayor's pinning a medal on me.
                   picture in the paper, the whole nine
                   yards.

                                 somerset
                   how was it?

                                 mills
                   i expected it to be bad, because i heard
                   about other guys.  you know... i took a
                   human life.  but, i slept like a baby
                   that night.

     somerset eats another antacid.

                                 somerset
                   i think hemingway wrote somewhere... i
                   can't remember where, but he wrote that,
                   in order to live in a city, you have to
                   have the ability to kill.  i think he
                   meant you truly must be able to do it,
                   not just faking it, to survive.

                                 mills
                   sounds like he knew what he was talking
                   about.
