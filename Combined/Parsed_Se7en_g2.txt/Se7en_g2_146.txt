     int.  somerset's apartment, bedroom -- early morning

     somerset sits away from the bed.  he's smoking a cigarette.  the
     phone rings.  somerset gets up, not in the best of moods.

                                 somerset
                           (into phone)
                   hello.

                                 tracy (v.o.)
                           (from phone, upset)
                   hello, somerset.  it's tracy.

                                 somerset
                   is everything alright?

                                 tracy (v.o.)
                   yes.  everything's fine.  could... could
                   you meet me somewhere.  to talk.

                                 somerset
                           (pause)
                   i don't think that's a good idea.

                                 tracy (v.o.)
                   i need to talk to someone, somerset.
                   you're the only friend i have here.  i
                   don't know anyone else.
