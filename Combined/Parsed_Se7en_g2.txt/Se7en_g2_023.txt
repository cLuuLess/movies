     int.  indoor fruit stand -- night

     tracy's anger fades.  she shakes her head, touched, amazed by
     the plain boy scoutishness of her husband.

     tracy's p.o.v. -- the street

     mills deposits the old woman on the other side.  she thanks him,
     patting him on the cheek.  mills starts back towards the fruit
     stand, proud of himself.  a car screeches to a halt, just
     missing him.  the driver leans out the window, yelling at mills.
     mills kicks the side of the car.

                                 mills
                   fuck you.
                           (as car leaves)
                   fuck you, you son of a bitch!  i'm
                   walking here.
