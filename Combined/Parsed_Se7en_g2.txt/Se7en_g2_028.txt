     int.  apartment/crime scene, hallway -- morning

     outside the door to the murder scene, mills and somerset cut
     through the restricted area/crime scene seal.

                                 somerset
                   those bruises on the back of the
                   victim's head were caused by the muzzle
                   of a gun.

                                 mills
                   so, the killer had him at gunpoint, and
                   gave him a choice: eat, or get your head
                   blown off.
