     ext.  mills' apartment, fire escape -- night

     through the window, we can see into the bedroom.  tracy comes
     back from the living room.  she goes to her side of the bed,
     kneels.  she reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes
     out a paperback book she has hidden there.

     she comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire
     escape.  she sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.  she
     opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting
     her head against the railing.  a woman is heard screaming
     distantly.

     tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.  the woman is not
     heard again.

     tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.  we can now
     see the title of the book: preparing for parenthood.  there is a
     picture of a baby on the cover.

     tracy cries, quietly.
