     int.  police helicopter -- late afternoon

     the chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers.  california and the
     pilot are listening, through their helmet headsets.

                                 mills (v.o.)
                           (from headset)
                   you want this to go well?  what is this?

                                 john doe (v.o.)
                           (from headset)
                   turn right on this street.  stay in the
                   left lane.

     california leans out the chopper door, using his binoculars.
