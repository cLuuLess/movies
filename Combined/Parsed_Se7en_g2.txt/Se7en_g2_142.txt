     int.  sports bar -- night

     somerset and mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them.
     the jukebox plays quietly for other customers.  the walls of the
     bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols.

                                 somerset
                   there's not going to be a happy ending.
                   it's not possible.

                                 mills
                   if we get him, i'll be happy enough.

                                 somerset
                   no.  face it now.  stop thinking it's
                   good guys against the bad guys in this
                   city.

     mills drinks deep, pours more.

                                 mills
                   how can you say that?  especially after
                   today?

                                 somerset
                   you tell me... when you walk into an
                   apartment, and a man has beaten his wife
                   to death, or, a wife murdered her
                   husband in cold blood... and you have to
                   wash the blood off their children.  you
                   put the killer in jail.  who won?

                                 mills
                   if i thought like you, i'd have slit my
                   wrists a long time ago.

                                 somerset
                   where's the victory?

                                 mills
                   you do your job.  follow the law and do
                   the best you can.  it's all there.

                                 somerset
                   if we caught john doe tomorrow, and it
                   turned out he was the devil... if it
                   turned out he was literally satan, then,
                   that might live up to our expectations.
                   no human being could do these horrible
                   things, right?!  but, this is not the
                   devil.  it's only a man.

                                 mills
                   why don't you shut the fuck up for a
                   while?!  huh?  you make these
                   speeches... like you know everything
                   there is to know.

     somerset sits back, looking at mills.

                                 mills (cont)
                   you think you're preparing me for the
                   hard times ahead?
                   you think you're toughening me up?
                   well, you're not!
                           (pause)
                   you're quitting, fine... but i'm staying
                   to fight.

                                 somerset
                   who are you fighting for?  people don't
                   want a champion.  they just want to keep
                   playing the lottery and eating
                   hamburgers.

                                 mills
                   what the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
                   what burnt you out?

                                 somerset
                   there's no one thing, if that's what you
                   mean.  i just... i can't live anymore
                   where stupidity is embraced and nurtured
                   as if it were a virtue.

                                 mills
                   you're so much better than everyone,
                   right?  no one's worthy of you.

                                 somerset
                   wrong!  i sympathize completely.
                   because if you can't win... then, if you
                   don't ignore everything and everyone
                   around you, you go insane.  it's easier
                   to smoke crack, and not worry that your
                   wife and kids are starving to death.
                   and, it's so much easier to bear a child
                   till that child finally shuts up,
                   because it takes so much work to love.
                   and, if you bothered to think about the
                   abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.

                                 mills
                   you're talking about people who are
                   mentally ill.  you're...

                                 somerset
                           (cuts in, furious)
                   no, i am not!  i'm talking about common,
                   everyday life here.  where ignorance
                   isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.

                                 mills
                   listen to yourself.  you say, "the
                   problem with people is they don't care,
                   so i don't care about people."  but, if
                   you're not part of the solution...

                                 somerset
                           (cuts him off)
                   people who are in arguments over their
                   heads always use meaningless slogans.
                   but, life doesn't conform to analogies.

                                 mills
                   you're already here, and you've been
                   here a long time.  so, there's a part of
                   you that knows, even if everything you
                   say is true, none of it matters.

                                 somerset
                   that part of me is dead.

     mills stands.

                                 mills
                   fuck you.  you want me to agree with
                   you.  "yeah, you're right, somerset,
                   this place is fucked.  let's go live in
                   a fucking log cabin!"  well, i don't
                   agree with you.  you're quitting, and it
                   makes me sick.  cause, you're the best
                   i've ever seen.

     mills digs out some money and throws it on the table.

                                 mills (cont)
                   thanks for the beer.

     mills leaves.  other patrons watch him go.  somerset takes out a
     cigarette.  he goes to light it.  the lighter will not light,
     and when it does, somerset's hand is shaking.
