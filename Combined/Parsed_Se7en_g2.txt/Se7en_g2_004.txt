     somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out
     the speeding train.  he is near the back of the car, away from
     the few other passengers.

     outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  the entire panorama
     is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.

     the light flickers across somerset's placid face.
