     ext.  country church -- day

     the white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
     the church bell rings, resonating.

     mass has let out.  small church, small congregation.  the dirt
     road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
     foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  an old two-story
     house sits across the road.  lone.
