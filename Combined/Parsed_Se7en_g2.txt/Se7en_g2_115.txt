     int.  bookstore -- night

     the bookstore is a labyrinth.  tables and shelves, mountains and
     valleys of books.  books, new and used, hard and soft, in
     disorganized groups.  classical music plays.  a few customers
     search for titles.

     somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another.
     he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the
     books as he goes.  he pulls one book, the merchant of venice,
     looks at it, replaces it.  he looks down the aisle and is
     surprised to see tracy.

     tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines.  somerset approaches.

                                 somerset
                   tracy?

     tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him.

                                 tracy
                   somerset.  how are you?

                                 somerset
                   i'm alright.  i'm glad to see you found
                   this place.  i almost should have
                   expected to run into you here, knowing
                   that you teach english.

     tracy looks up and around.

                                 tracy
                   it's so huge.  it's amazing.

                                 somerset
                   this is why i moved into this
                   neighborhood.

                                 tracy
                   don't you love the smell of all the old
                   books.  it smells like... like... i
                   guess just old books, but, i love it.

     somerset notices tracy noticing his gun.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   forgive me.  no matter how often i see
                   guns, i can't get used to them.

                                 somerset
                   same here.

     tracy laughs.  she looks at her watch.

                                 tracy
                   if david's going to be back home soon, i
                   should get back.

     she starts down the aisle and somerset walks with her.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   i hope you'll come to dinner another
                   night.  before you leave.

                                 somerset
                   you can stay and browse a little longer,
                   can't you?  i mean...

     tracy considers this as they enter an open area.

                                  somerset (cont)
                   i... i hardly know anyone i can talk
                   about books with anymore.  i'd
                   appreciate the company.

     tracy stops.  somerset looks hopeful.  tracy is very tempted.
