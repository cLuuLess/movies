     int.  safe house -- night

     the room is like a bland hotel room.  mills stands beside mrs
     gold.  he shows her photos from the murder scene.  mrs. gold is
     crying.  somerset stands across the room.

                                 mills
                   please, look for anything strange or out
                   of place.  anything at all.

                                 mrs gold
                   i... i don't understand.  why now?

     mills helps her go through the photos.  he is shaken himself,
     not wanting to put her through this.

                                 mills
                   i need your help if we're going to get
                   the guy who killed your husband.  if
                   there's anything in these pictures...

     mrs. gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears.

                                 mrs gold
                   i don't see anything.

                                 mills
                   are you absolutely sure?

                                 mrs gold
                   i can't do this now... please.

ette to the empty street, watching the
     glowing tip fall.  he looks at the woman's circled eyes.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   he sees himself contributing to the body
                   of christian work.

                                 mills
                   he's punishing these people.

                                 somerset
                   for all of us to see and learn from.
                   these murders are like forced attrition.

                                 mills
                   what?  forced what?

                                 somerset
                   attrition.  when you regret your sins,
                   but not because you love god.

                                 mills
                   because someone's holding a gun on you.

     somerset thinks.  he walks from the edge to mills.

                                 somerset
                   when mr. gold's wife found the body,
                   about how long was she in the apartment?

                                 mills
                   she didn't find it.  the door to the
                   apartment was open and a neighbor...

                                 somerset
                   i thought you said she found the body.
                   when she got back from a business trip.

                                 mills
                   no.  she got back after you and i had
                   already been there.

     somerset thinks, coming up with something.

                                 mills (cont)
                   what?

     somerset holds up the photo of mrs. gold.

                                 somerset
                   maybe she is supposed to see
                   something... she just hasn't had a
                   chance to see it yet.
