     int.  precinct house, somerset's office -- morning

     old office.  moving boxes on the floor.  the single window faces
     a billboard.  somerset works on a manual typewriter.  he types
     hunt-and-peck, slowly.  his paperwork is on the desk in two
     sloppy piles.  a jarring sound is heard offscreen, like fingers
     on a blackboard.  somerset looks up, irritated.

     a workman is working at the open door, holding the source of the
     sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words detective
     somerset off the door's window.

                                 workman
                   sorry.

     somerset turns back to typing.  the captain steps in, looks at
     the workman, then drops more papers on somerset's desk.

     as always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.  he
     looks around.  two of boxes on the floor have detective mills
     written across them.  the captain picks one up, puts it on top
     of the other.  he sits, watching somerset, starts straightening
     the forms on the desk.

                                 captain
                   what are you going to do with yourself
                   out there, somerset?

                                 somerset
                   i'll get a job.  maybe on a farm.  i'll
                   fix up my house.

                                 captain
                   can't you feel it yet?
                           (pause)
                   can't you feel that feeling... that you
                   won't be special anymore?

                                 somerset
                           (lying)
                   i don't know what you mean.

                                 captain
                   you know.

     somerset reclines, looks at the captain.

                                 somerset
                   did you read in the paper today, about
                   the man who took his dog for a walk?
                   and how he was mugged?  and, his wallet
                   was taken, and his watch.  then, while
                   he was still lying unconscious, his
                   attacker stabbed him with a knife in
                   both eyes.  it happened last night.  not
                   far from here.

                                 captain
                   i heard.

                                 somerset
                   i have no understanding of this place.

                                 captain
                   it's always been like this.

     somerset saddles up to the typewriter.  hunt-and-peck.

                                 somerset
                   yes.  you're absolutely right.

     the captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.

                                 captain
                   you were made for this work, somerset.
                   i can't believe you're going to trade it
                   all in for a tool belt and a fishing
                   rod.  but, i guess i'm wrong.

     the captain leaves.  somerset looks up now that the captain's
     gone.  he grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their
     disheveled state.  he looks at the workman.

     the workman is looking at somerset, has a rag in his hand to
     remove the last remnants of somerset's name.

                                 somerset
                           (angrily)
                   put a little elbow grease into it!

     the workman is startled, continues his work.
