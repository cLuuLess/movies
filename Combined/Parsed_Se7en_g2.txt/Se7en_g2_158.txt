     int.  mills' car -- late afternoon

     mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview
     mirror.  a steel mesh partition separates front from back.

     john doe sits with his hands cuffed.  he is dressed in gray
     pants and a gray shirt.  his feet are cuffed to a metal fastener
     on the floor of the car.  rivulets of sweat pour down his face.
     he seems wired.

                                 mills
                   what's your story, johnny?  who are you,
                   really?

     doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at
     mills' eyes in the rearview mirror.

                                 john doe
                   it doesn't matter who i am.  who i am
                   means absolutely nothing.
