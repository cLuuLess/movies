     int.  moving truck -- day

     the truck moves along in steady traffic.  tracy sits beside the
     driver.  she looks out at the city across the river.

     she reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope.
     she opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out
     into her palm.

     she's looking at the keys when she notices something about the
     envelope.  she reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of
     paper.  she unfolds it:

     it is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center.

     she smiles very faintly.
