     ext.  city street -- day

     mills and somerset walk towards the precinct house.  they wade
     through cars to cross the street.

                                 somerset
                   i've decided... i want to stay on, till
                   this is over.  till either it's done, or
                   we can see it will never end.

     mills remains impassive.

                                 mills
                   oh, you want to stay now?

                                 somerset
                   one of two things is going to happen.
                   we're either going to get john doe...
                   or, he will finish his series of seven,
                   and he'll never be found.

                                mills
                   you think if you stay you're doing me
                   some big favor?

                                 somerset
                   i'm requesting you keep me on as your
                   partner a few more days.  you'd be doing
                   me the favor.

                                 mills
                   you knew i'd say yes.

                                 somerset
                   no.  i wasn't sure at all.

     they enter the precinct house.  down the sidewalk, from a
     distance, comes john doe.  his brown workboots and clothing are
     splattered with blood.

     he walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like
     he's merely out for a walk on a sunday afternoon.  people on the
     sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him.
