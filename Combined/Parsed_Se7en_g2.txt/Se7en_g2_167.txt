     int.  mills' car -- late afternoon

     beyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson.

                                 mills
                   wouldn't be sensational enough.

                                 john doe
                   wanting people to pay attention, you
                   can't just tap them on the shoulder.

     john doe strains to turn, looks out the back window.

                                 john doe (cont)
                   sometimes you have to hit them in the
                   head with a sledgehammer... and then you
                   get their strict attention.

                                 mills
                   what are you looking at, johnny?

                                 john doe
                   looking back... at the city proper...

     doe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face,
     looking at his bandaged fingers.

                                 john doe (cont)
                   and yet, no pillar of salt.
                           (smiles to himself)
                   lost on you, isn't it?  you've never
                   read the bible, have you, david?

                                 mills
                   i remember a lot of people reading it at
                   me when i was a kid.  i preferred the
                   classic comic version myself.

     this is an affront to doe, angers him.  mills sees it, likes it.

                                 mills (cont)
                   i used to have "godspell" on an eight-
                   track tape.  does that count?

     doe leans forwards, fury building in him.

                                 john doe
                   you make me sick.

                                 mills
                   sit back, freak.

     mills slams his fist against the partition.  doe sits back.

                                 john doe
                           (under his breath)
                   ignorant heathen.

                                 mills
                   right, right.  i forgot.  you think
                   these murders were for god.  right?
                           (pause)
                   i'm asking you seriously.  you really
                   think what you did was god's good work?

     doe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer.

     he's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs,
     causing blood to drip from under the bandages.

                                 john doe
                   the lord works in mysterious ways.
