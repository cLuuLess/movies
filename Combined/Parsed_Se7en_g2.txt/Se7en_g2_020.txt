     int.  urban school, office -- day

     tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars.

     below her, young children play in a playground.  they're playing
     hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other.  the swing sets
     are broken.  the handball wall is graffitied.

                                 woman's voice (o.s.)
                   i'm sorry, mrs. mills.  we don't have
                   anything right now.

     tracy looks away from the window to the haggard woman.  the
     school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized.

                                 woman (cont)
                   we'll try to give you a call if we need
                   substitutes next month.

                                 tracy
                   thank you.

     tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a
     chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the
     ramp of a freezer truck.  he carries a big, whole, slaughtered
     pig on his shoulder.

     the pig's head flops as the butcher walks.  some children stop
     their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.
