     int.  somerset's car -- late afternoon

     a cellular phone on the passenger side is beeping.  somerset
     pushes a button on the phone's panel.  he puts on a
     headset/telephone, speaks into the mouthpiece.

                                 somerset
                   i'm here.

                                 california (v.o.)
                           (from headset)
                   downtown and moving west.  looks like
                   you're going to be crossing water.

                                 somerset
                   if we're on the bridge, you keep your
                   distance.  you hear me?
