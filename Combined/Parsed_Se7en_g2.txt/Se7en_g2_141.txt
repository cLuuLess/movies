     somerset enters, latches the door.  he takes the crushed photo
     and envelope from his pocket.  he quickly checks under the
     stalls to see he is alone.  he opens a window, goes to the sink.

     throws them in the sink.

     he backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick.
