     int.  precinct house, somerset's office -- day

     mills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard:

                    1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x)
                    2 greed (x)          6 wrath
                    3 sloth (x)          7 envy
                    4 pride (x)

     clock on the wall says 4:45.  somerset packs books into boxes,
     preparing for his eventual departure.  the captain opens the
     door and steps into the office.  he clears his throat, looking
     like there is something very wrong.
