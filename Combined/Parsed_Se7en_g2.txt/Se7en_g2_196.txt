     ext.  cemetery -- day

     a field of blue.  cops in orderly rows.  the funeral of david
     mills.  many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.

     somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform.  he stares forward,
     still numb, beaten.  rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.
     blanks explode from the barrels.  they reload in unison.

     somerset looks towards the grace where mills' casket lies under
     an american flag.  tracy is there.

     tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site.  her
     head is lowered.  she cries.  each blast of the rifle salute
     causes her to react with a start.
