     int.  precinct house, ready room -- early morning

     a windowless classroom.  the captain stands in front with a
     white screen at his side.  the face of a black man, 25, zero, is
     projected on the screen from a slide projector.

                                 captain
                   his street name is zero, as some of you
                   know.  his prints were found at the
                   scene by detectives mills and somerset.

     five hardened police officers, four men, one woman, sit in
     chairs facing the captain.  they all wear bullet-proof vests
     with "police" stencil-painted across them.  somerset and mills
     sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.

                                 captain (cont)
                   now, zero has a long, long history of
                   mental illness.  serious illness.  he
                   was all over your television sets two
                   years ago after he raped and killed a
                   seventy-three year old woman.  he got
                   off, as the saying goes, on a
                   technicality.  so we watched him on the
                   streets, and he went out of circulation
                   about a year ago.

                                 female cop
                   if he disappeared, what do you want from
                   us?

                                 captain
                   his last place of residence is still in
                   his name.  a search warrant is being
                   pushed through the court as we speak.

     a red-headed cop, california, 28, raises his meaty hand.

                                 california
                   so, have the housing cops walk up and
                   ring the doorbell.  problem solved.

     the cops laugh.  the captain clenches his jaw.

                                 captain
                   listen, california.  when you go in, if
                   zero isn't home, some of his buddies
                   might be house-sitting.  and besides
                   using, zero deals, so, you will be very
                   uninvited guests.

     there is chatter among the cops.  somerset leans to mills while
     the captain continues the briefing.

                                 somerset
                   does not seem like our killer, does it?

                                 mills
                   you tell me.  i'm new in town.

                                 somerset
                   zero does possess the requisite degree
                   of insanity... but, he doesn't have the
                   desire somehow.  our killer seems to
                   have more purpose.  more purpose than
                   zero could ever conceive of.

                                 mills
                   we'll tag along.

     somerset wants no part of that.

                                 somerset
                   why would we?

                                 mills
                   satisfy our curiosity?
