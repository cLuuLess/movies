     int.  precinct house, captain's office -- day

     mills and somerset stand together.  the captain is behind his
     desk with the d.a., martin talbot, seated in front of him.  mark
     swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.

                                 swarr
                   my client says there are two more
                   bodies... two more dead, hidden away.
                   he will take detective mills to these
                   bodies, but only detective mills.  only
                   at six o'clock, today.

     swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                 talbot
                   oh, christ.

                                 mills
                   why me?

                                 swarr
                   he says he admires you.

                                 somerset
                           (to captain)
                   this is all part of his game plan.

                                 swarr
                   mr. doe claims that if the detective
                   does not accept this offer, the bodies
                   will never be found.

                                 captain
                   frankly, counselor, i'm inclined to let
                   them rot.

     mills walks up into swarr's face.

                                 mills
                   you like what you do for a living?

                                 captain
                   back off, mills.

                                 swarr
                   i'm required by law to serve my clients
                   to the best of my ability, and to serve
                   their interests.

     mills eases off.  talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the
     gold tooth in his mouth.  he looks at swarr.

                                 talbot
                   we don't make deals like this.

                                 captain
                   we're going to have to pass.

                                 swarr
                   my client... he also wishes that i
                   inform you, if you do not accept, he
                   will plead insanity, across the board.

                                 talbot
                   let him try.  i'd like to see him try!

                                 swarr
                   come now, martin.  even he knows, with
                   the nature of these crimes, i could get
                   him off with such a plea.

     talbot stands, wringing his hands.  mills and somerset are
     looking at each other, thinking it over.

                                 talbot
                   i'm not letting this conviction slide.
                   i can tell you that, right here and
                   right now!

                                 swarr
                   he says, if you accept, under his
                   specific conditions, he will sign a full
                   confession and plead guilty... right
                   here, and right now.

     talbot looks at swarr with hatred.

                                 mills
                   i'll do it.

                                 somerset
                   hold on... just a minute.

     somerset turns to talbot.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   if he were to plead insanity... this
                   conversation is admissible.  the fact
                   that he's blackmailing us with his
                   plea...

                                 swarr
                   and, my client reminds you, two more
                   people are dead.  the press would have a
                   field day if they found out the police
                   didn't seem too concerned about finding
                   them... giving them proper burial.

                                 mills
                   i'll do it.  i want to finish it.

     somerset is thinking it through.  he looks at mills.

                                 somerset
                           (to captain)
                   well... let's get the fucking lawyer out
                   of the room, and we can talk about how
                   this whole thing's going to go down.
