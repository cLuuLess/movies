     int.  central library -- afternoon

     big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling.  mahogany chairs and
     tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three
     levels of balconies.  people wander like ants in an ant farm.

     mills walks, taking it all in.  he goes to the circulation desk.
     impatient patrons wait in a long line.  he watches the bored
     head librarian, female, 64, help an old man at the desk.

     she opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code
     sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer.
