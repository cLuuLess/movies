     ext.  mills' apartment building, rooftop -- night

     somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of mrs. gold.  he
     puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.

                                 somerset
                   it's like he's preaching.
                           (pause)
                   the sins were used in medieval sermons.
                   there were seven cardinal virtues, and
                   then seven deadly sins, as a learning
                   tool.  the sins distract man from true
                   worship.  true faith.

     mills is seated at the table with art books open.

     a breeze fans the pages of the books.  the flipping pages reveal
     views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.

                                 mills
                   like in these paintings, and in dante's
                   purgatory, right?  but, in purgatory,
                   dante and his buddy climb that big
                   mountain...

                                 somerset
                   seven terraces of purgation.

                                 mills
                   anyway... pride comes first, not
                   gluttony.  and in all the paintings,
                   the sins are in a different order.  i
                   can't find a pattern.

                                 somerset
                   because there's creativity in the mix.
                   consider these books as the murderer's
                   inspiration.  or aspiration.

     somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the
     glowing tip fall.  he looks at the woman's circled eyes.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   he sees himself contributing to the body
                   of christian work.

                                 mills
                   he's punishing these people.

                                 somerset
                   for all of us to see and learn from.
                   these murders are like forced attrition.

                                 mills
                   what?  forced what?

                                 somerset
                   attrition.  when you regret your sins,
                   but not because you love god.

                                 mills
                   because someone's holding a gun on you.

     somerset thinks.  he walks from the edge to mills.

                                 somerset
                   when mr. gold's wife found the body,
                   about how long was she in the apartment?

                                 mills
                   she didn't find it.  the door to the
                   apartment was open and a neighbor...

                                 somerset
                   i thought you said she found the body.
                   when she got back from a business trip.

                                 mills
                   no.  she got back after you and i had
                   already been there.

     somerset thinks, coming up with something.

                                 mills (cont)
                   what?

     somerset holds up the photo of mrs. gold.

                                 somerset
                   maybe she is supposed to see
                   something... she just hasn't had a
                   chance to see it yet.
