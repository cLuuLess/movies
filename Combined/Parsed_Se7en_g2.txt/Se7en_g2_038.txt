     ext.  city streets, downtown -- night

     an assault on the senses.  crowded streets and sidewalks.  on
     every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,
     junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.  a few
     tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.
     buildings border narrowly.

     somerset walks against the stream.  he carries a file.

     car horns howl.  music blasts from the entrances of clubs.
     reggae from one club is soon overtaken by rap from a second
     story window.  techno-pop blasts from the tattoo parlor.

     somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.  he
     walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.  the men are
     pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.

     somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he
     crosses through the traffic jam in the street.  a vagrant steps
     up with his hand out.

                                 vagrant
                   spare me a cigarette, money-grip?  spare
                   me a cigarette?

                                 somerset
                   sorry.  last one.

     he walks on.  we begin to hear jazz music.
