     ext.  city streets -- late afternoon

     from high above, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted
     river's edge.  cards and trucks move like blood through veins.

     down closer, we can see mills' car in the flow.  the car turns
     into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge.

     somerset's car is in close pursuit.

     under the bridge, the police helicopter travels close to the
     water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out
     of the sightline of the vehicles above.
