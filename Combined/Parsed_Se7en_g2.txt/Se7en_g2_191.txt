     ext.  industrial junk-yard -- night

     somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still
     soaking wet.  he stops for one second, looks.

     not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,
     turning in wide circles.

     somerset climbs into the car, starts it up.  he drives away,
     leaving his lights off.  the engine protests loudly, forced to
     its limit.  the car disappears in darkness.

     the police helicopter circles, useless.
