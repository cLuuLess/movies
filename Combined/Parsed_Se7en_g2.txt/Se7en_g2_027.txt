     int.  autopsy room -- early morning

     the room is cold, clean.  stainless steel.  white tile.  many
     pathologists work at slabs.  mills and somerset are with doctor
     santiago, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse.

                                 santiago
                   if you take a look here, buddies...
                   i can tell you, it was not a poison.
                   if you can see...
                   i have emptied all of everything out of
                   the stomach.  but, look at it, now that
                   i took away the liver.

     santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  mills
     moves closer beside somerset, but not too close, trying to hide
     his disgust.  we hear squashy sounds as santiago works, but we
     don't see in.

                                 santiago (cont)
                   i move the lungs over.  first, see how
                   big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.
                   now... here is the strange thing, on the
                   stomach.  stretches.
                           (pointing)
                   and, here is it distended.  look at the
                   size of that, because of the foods.

                                 mills
                   i can see what you're pointing at...

                                 santiago
                   on the stomach.  the lines of
                   distention.

     somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.

                                 somerset
                   doctor, are you saying this man... ate
                   till he burst?

                                 santiago
                   yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  he
                   was bleeding, inside of himself.
                   and, there's a hemotoma on the
                   outside... on the belly.

     somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.

                                 mills
                   he died by eating?

                                 santiago
                   someone punched him, or kicked him.

     somerset notices something on the partially shaved head.

     he leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back
     of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than
     others, all about the same diameter as a dime.

                                 santiago (cont)
                   oh, and there is this here... something
                   else you have to look at and see.

     somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises.

                                 santiago (cont)
                   most of his stomach contents are in the
                   lab now... but, this.  i found these in
                   the fat man's stomach.

     santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  he
     picks up a glass jar and shows it to mills.  in the jar: many
     little bits of blue plastic.  like scrapings.

                                 mills
                   plastic?

     mills gets somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  somerset
     looks at it a long time.

                                 santiago
                   why these were in a fat man's stomach, i
                   don't know.
