     int.  precinct house, basement gym -- day

     thwack, thwack... thwack.  mills punches the heavy bag with
     hard, quick punches.  sweat drips off his face.  he's in work-
     out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves.

     the walls are covered in mirrors.  other cops watch mills as
     they pass, checking out the new kid.  mills keeps punching,
     skillfully.

     he stops when he sees somerset reflected in one of the mirrors.
     somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on
     top.  he sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.

                                 somerset
                   pizza and paperwork, detective mills.

                                 mills
                   we need to chat.
