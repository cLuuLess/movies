     int.  precinct house, bathroom -- late afternoon

     mills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.  he's
     shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream.  he starts
     shaving in front of a mirror.  somerset is behind him, smoking.

                                 somerset
                   if john doe's head splits open, and a
                   u.f.o. flies out, i want you to have
                   expected it.

                                 mills
                   i will.

                                 somerset
                   no emotion.  stay as cold as ice.

                                 mills
                   i will.

     somerset flicks ash in the sink.  mills finishes shaving.  he
     steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel.

                                 mills (cont)
                           (very serious)
                   listen, somerset... we've been through a
                   lot together.  and, i uh...

                                 somerset
                   what is it?

                                 mills
                   i would like to make sweet love to you.

     somerset walks away.  mills laughs.

                                 somerset
                   please...

     as they leave.

                                 mills
                   give me a kiss on the lips.

                                 somerset
                   give me a break.
