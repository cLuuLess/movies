     int.  john doe's apartment, room one -- night

     the forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag,
     past a female sketch artist who puts the finishing touches on a
     fairly accurate drawing of the balding john doe.

                                 sketch artist
                   this is the guy?

     mills stands over the artist.  sarah, billy and two deputy
     detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching.

                                 mills
                   make sure it gets around.

                                 sketch artist
                   you got it.  tomorrow morning, this
                   city's good citizens will be on the
                   lookout for elmer fudd.

                                 sarah
                           (to mills)
                   we can't find anything to hang onto.  no
                   pay-stubs, no appointment books or
                   calendars.  not even a book of phone
                   numbers.  and, you're not going to
                   believe this...

                                 mills
                   keep looking.

                                 sara
                   it's just... we haven't found any
                   fingerprints yet.  not one.

                                 mills
                   you know, you're right.  i don't believe
                   it.  keep looking.
