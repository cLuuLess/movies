     int.  underground waterworks -- night

     the central pool bubbles, undulating.  somerset surfaces,
     inhaling, bringing his gun up.  he looks.  no one in sight.

                                 somerset
                   mills!  pull out!

     his voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water.
     he swims to the edge, climbs out.  he walks, looking...

                                 somerset (cont)
                           (pleading)
                   pull out now!

     somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing --

     -- doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk
     above, with mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them.
