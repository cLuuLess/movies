     int.  mills' apartment, living room/kitchenette -- night

     tracy leads somerset into the disarray of the apartment.

                                 tracy
                   david went for a walk.  to clear his
                   head.  oh, you can put those here.

                                 somerset
                   thank you.

     tracy motions and somerset puts the books on mills' desk.
     he starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   could you tell him... tell him this is
                   his reading assignment.  it's urgent.
                   i've marked the most important pages.

                                 tracy
                   would you like some coffee, or a drink.
                   david should be back any minute.

                                 somerset
                   i do have to get going.

     somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens
     and pencils.  he picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the
     philadelphia police department.

                                 tracy
                   at least i got to meet you.  david has
                   told me a lot about you.

                                 somerset
                   really?  good things, i hope.

                                 tracy
                   oh, yes.  he said you were very smart.

                                 somerset
                   really?

                                 tracy
                   i think he's a bit intimidated by you.

     somerset thinks about this, finds it hard to believe.  he goes
     through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps.

                                 somerset
                   i'm going to leave him a list of
                   specifics.  it all relates to the case
                   he's on.

     he lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits
     to start writing on the notepad.  tracy goes to the kitchenette
     to get a chair.

                                 tracy
                   you two aren't working together anymore.
                   isn't that so?

                                 somerset
                   to be perfectly honest, mrs. mills...

                                 tracy
                   tracy.

                                 somerset
                   tracy.  david and i weren't exactly what
                   you could call fast friends.

                                 tracy
                   that's too bad.

     tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits.  somerset
     looks up from his writing.

                                 somerset
                   i doubt your husband shares that
                   opinion.

     tracy nods, leaning forward, semi-conspiratorially.

                                 tracy
                   you know, somerset, david is very...
                   determined.  i'm sure you've seen, it's
                   not likely he'll ever be compared to
                   gandhi.

                                 somerset
                   he's a good cop.  he just...

                                 tracy
                   he sees policework as a crusade.  that's
                   what he wants it to be, and, that might
                   sound naive, but he's made a conscious
                   choice to be naive.
                           (pause)
                   believe me, his heart's in the right
                   place.

     somerset pauses, enchanted by her.

                                 somerset
                   i hear you and he were high school
                   sweethearts.

                                 tracy
                   yeah.  pretty hokey, huh?  but, what
                   girl wouldn't want the captain of the
                   football team as their lifelong mate?

                                 somerset
                   it's rare these days... that kind of
                   commitment.

                                 tracy
                   i guess so.

     tracy's smile falters a bit.  somerset notices this.  he breaks
     from her spell, turns to continue writing.

                                 somerset
                   well... this will only take a minute.

                                 tracy
                   take your time.

     somerset writes.  tracy looks over the stack of books:

     titles on the spines: bosch, a history of christian art, bregel
     the elder, etc.  hardcover novels: dante's purgatory and the
     canterbury tales.

     tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of
     paper scraps from somerset's pocket.  she picks up the piece of
     wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   what is this?

     somerset looks up.  sees her holding the paper rose.  he takes
     it, slightly self-conscious, looks at it.

                                 somerset
                   my future.

     tracy tilts her head, looking at somerset.

                                 tracy
                   you have a strange way about you,
                   somerset... i mean in a good way...
                   unusual.

     somerset doesn't know what to say.  he pockets the paper rose.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   i apologize.  i'll get out of your hair.

     tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   it's just... it's nice to hear a man who
                   talks like that.  if david saw that
                   paper, he'd say you're acting like a
                   homosexual.  that's how he is.

                                 somerset
                           (mock indignation)
                   well!  i guess i won't be showing this to
                   him then.

                                 tracy
                   i suppose not.

     somerset continues writing.  tracy sits at the kitchenette
     table, watches him.
