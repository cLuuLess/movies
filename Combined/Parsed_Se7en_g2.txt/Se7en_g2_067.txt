     int.  precinct house, print lab -- night

     dark.  a technician sits before an old computer.  the computer's
     green screen shows fingerprints being aligned, compared and then
     rejected; whir - click - whir - click - whir - click.  mills and
     somerset watch, bathed in the green glow.

                                 somerset
                   it doesn't work for me.  i can't believe
                   he wants us to help him stop.

                                 mills
                   who the hell knows?  there's plenty of
                   schizoids out there doing dirty deeds
                   they don't want to do.  with tiny voices
                   whispering nasty things in their ears.

     somerset doesn't buy it.  the technician adjusts a knob.

                                 technician
                   i've seen this baby take three days to
                   finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross
                   your fingers somewhere else.
