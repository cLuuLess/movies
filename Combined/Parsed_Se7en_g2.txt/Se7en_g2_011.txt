     int.  tenement apartment -- day

     a wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  somerset stands,
     melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a
     sawed-off shotgun.  the apartment is gloomy.  detective taylor,
     52, looks through a notepad.

                                  taylor
                   neighbors heard them screaming at each
                   other.  it was nothing new or unusual.
                   but, then they heard the gun go off.
                   boom, boom... both barrels.

                                  somerset
                   did his wife confess?  did she actually
                   speak the words?

                                  taylor
                   when the patrolman got here she was
                   trying to put his head back together.
                   she was crying too hard to say anything.
                           (shuts notebook)
                   crime of passion.

                                  somerset
                   yes.  look at all the passion splattered
                   up on the wall here.

     taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.

                                  taylor
                   this is a done deal.  all but the
                   paperwork.

     somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table.
     there are crayons beside it.  somerset picks the book up.

     he flips through: crudely colored pictures.

                                  somerset
                   did their son see it happen?

                                  taylor
                   what kind of question is that?  huh?
                           (pointing)
                   he's dead.  his wife killed him.  there
                   it is.  that's all.  anything else has
                   nothing to do with nothing.

     somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket.

                                  taylor (cont)
                   you and your fucking questions,
                   somerset.  i'm glad i'm getting rid of
                   you today.  you know that, you fuck?

     david mills enters, dressed in a suit.  he looks a bit lost.

                                  mills
                   uh... lieutenant somerset?

     somerset lights his cigarette, looks to mills.

                                  mills (cont)
                   i'm david mills... your new partner.
