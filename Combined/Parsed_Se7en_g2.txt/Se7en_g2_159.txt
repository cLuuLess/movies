     int.  somerset's car -- late afternoon

     somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the
     dash.  he watches the road ahead, tailing mills.

                                 mills (v.o.)
                           (from receiver)
                   what's your deal?  you seem pretty
                   fucking nervous.

                                 john doe (v.o.)
                           (from receiver)
                   i want this to go well.  it's very
                   important to me, obviously.
