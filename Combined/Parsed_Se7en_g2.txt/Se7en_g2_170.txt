     int.  somerset's car -- night

     the headlights are off.  mills' car's red brake lights are far
     ahead on this industrial road.

                                 california (v.o.)
                           (from headset)
                   i don't see anything... not yet.

                                 somerset
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   a quick sweep is all we get.  clear out
                   now.  you're right in front of us.

     somerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver.
     mills is heard singing "jesus christ superstar," loud.  somerset
     allows a very faint smile.
