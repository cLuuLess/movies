     int.  somerset's apartment, bedroom -- night

     somerset is in bed.  the metronome is sounding: tick, tick,
     tick... the sounds of the city are loud.

     somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  tick,
     tick, tick... a man and a woman are heard screaming at each
     other incoherently from outside.  somerset rolls over, restless. 
     tick, tick, tick...

     a third voice is heard from outside.  this man is screaming at
     the other two people to shut up.  somerset opens his eyes, sits
     up.  he reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against
     the wall.
