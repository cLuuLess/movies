     int.  luxury apartment/crime scene, living room -- night

     a male forensic uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear
     fingerprint in black powder on the wall.

                                 forensic
                   oh, boy...

                                 mills (o.s.)
                   talk to me.

     the forensic bites his lip, still studying.

     mills and somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen.

                                 mills (cont)
                           (to somerset)
                   listen, honestly... have you ever seen
                   anything like this?  been involved in
                   anything remotely like this?

                                 somerset
                   no.  i have not.

                                 forensic (o.s.)
                   well, i can tell you this, detectives...

     the forensic steps down from a stool.  behind him, where the
     painting once was, there are fingerprints, clear and distinct.
     the prints have been left side by side, to form letters which
     form the words: help me.

                                 forensic (cont)
                   ...just by studying the underloop...
                   these are not the victim's prints.
