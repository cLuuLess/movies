     int.  mills' apartment, living room/kitchenette -- night

     mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up.
     he moves, crouching.

     in the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form
     complex, confusing patterns.

     mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent.
     he aims the gun from point to point as he advances.

     he gets to a closet.  staying on one side, he opens the door and
     points his gun.  he carefully separates the clothing hanging
     there.  nothing.  no one.

     he turns to look over the room.  it's the first time we see it
     in mills' eyes -- real fear.

     the door to the apartment is wide open.
