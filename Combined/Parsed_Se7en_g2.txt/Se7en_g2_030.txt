     int.  apartment/crime scene, kitchen -- later morning

     we are behind the refrigerator as it is rocked back and forth.
     it's pulled away from the wall.  somerset and mills strain, pull
     a few more feet, then release.  they lean to look --

     the refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust
     has been cleared.  in that space: a circle, smeared in grease,
     and a note taped in the center of the circle.

     somerset's beeper starts beeping.  mills leans to read:

                                 mills
                   "dear detectives.  long is the way, and
                   hard, that out of hell leads up to the
                   light."
                           (looks at somerset)
                   this is not good.

                                 somerset
                   milton.

                                 mills
                   what?

                                 somerset
                   it's a quote from a book.  milton's
                   paradise lost.

     somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the led window.  he
     looks up at mills, like they've received very bad news.
