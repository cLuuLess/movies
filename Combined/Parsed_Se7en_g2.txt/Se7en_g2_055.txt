     ext.  mills' apartment building, rooftop -- night

     mills and somerset walk onto the roof.  it is a spectacular view
     on all sides.  miles of city lights.  breathtaking.  sounds of
     the city reach them.

                                 somerset
                   no connection between the two victims?

     mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty
     table.  he sits in one of two lawn chairs.  somerset sits across
     from him.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   no witnesses of any kind?

                                 mills
                   none.  which i can't understand.  it's
                   like this guy's invisible.


                                 somerset
                   in this city, minding your own business
                   is a perfected science.

     somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun
     with an eye at its center.  he opens a book, christian symbols,
     which is full of illustrations.  he starts paging through.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   at the precinct, sunday nights, they
                   offer a public crime prevention course.
                   and, the very first thing they teach is
                   that you should never scream "help" if
                   you're in trouble.  scream "fire."
                   because people don't want to get caught
                   up in anything.  but, a fire... that's
                   entertainment.  they come running.

     somerset holds the books up to mills, points to a picture of the
     sun and eye, same as the drawing mills found.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   "the sun in splendor with the eye."  it
                   refers to god the father, and to saint
                   thomas aquinas.

                                 mills
                   which saint is he?

                                 somerset
                   aquinas wrote a summary of theology,
                   summa theologica.  and he wrote about
                   the seven deadly sins.

     mills takes the book and looks it over.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   now, what else have you got?

                                 mills
                   look, i appreciate being able to talk
                   this out, but... it's my case.

                                 somerset
                   so... satisfying my curiosity.  i'm
                   still leaving town on sunday.

     mills is pondering, very tired.  he unlatches his briefcase,
     takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and
     hands it to somerset.

                                 mills
                   the eyes were circled.  with mr. gold's
                   blood.

                                 somerset
                   this is his wife?

                                 mills
                           (nods)
                   she was away on business.  she got back
                   the day he was killed.  if this means
                   she saw anything, i don't know what.
                   we've questioned her about ten times.

                                 somerset
                   and, if it's a threat?

                                 mills
                   we put her in a safe house.

                                 somerset
                   this is the one thing.

                                 mills
                   i know.
