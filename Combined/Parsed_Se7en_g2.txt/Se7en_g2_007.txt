     int.  somerset's apartment -- later night -- (end credits)

     curtains closed.  the sounds of the city are here as they will
     be everywhere in this story.  a car alarm shrieks.  somerset's
     life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a
     closet and hundreds of books on shelves.

     somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.
     he reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
     metronome.

     he frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and
     forth.  swings to the left... tick, swings to the right... tick.
     tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.

     somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  the metronome's
     ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  somerset's
     face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.

     his eyes close tighter.

     tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  somerset's
     breathing deepens.  the car alarm seems quieter.

     tick, tick, tick.  somerset continues his concentration.

     the metronome is the only sound.  somerset's face relaxes
     slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  tick, tick, tick...
