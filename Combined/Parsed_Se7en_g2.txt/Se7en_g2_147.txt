     int.  coffee cafe -- morning

     somerset and tracy are seated in a booth by the window.  the
     city's morning rush passes by outside.  the cafe is noisy.
     tracy is very upset.  somerset is very uneasy.

                                 somerset
                   david doesn't know about this?  you
                   haven't told him?

     tracy shakes her head.  somerset sighs.  long silence.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   i have to tell you, tracy, i'm not the
                   one to talk to about this.

                                 tracy
                   i just can't think straight.  i don't
                   know why i called you, except i can't
                   stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  i
                   had to get it out... and i can't tell
                   david yet.  not yet.

     somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and
     puts them away.  he watches tracy stir her coffee.

                                 somerset
                   i... i had a relationship once, very
                   much like a marriage.  and, there was a
                   baby.  a long time ago.  things were
                   good.  and i got up one morning, and i
                   went on a case... a murder, like any
                   other.  except it was my first since
                   hearing about the baby.  and, i felt
                   this fear and anxiety coming over me.  i
                   looked around and i thought, how can i
                   raise a child here?  so, that night, i
                   told her i didn't want us to have
                   children,  and, over the next few
                   weeks... i convinced her...

     tears come to somerset's eyes.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   i mean, i wore her down... slowly.

                                 tracy
                   i want to have children.  but...

                                 somerset
                   i can tell you, i know... i'm positive i
                   made the right decision.  i'm positive
                   it was the right thing to do.  but,
                   there's never a day that goes by that i
                   don't wish i had decided differently.

     tracy reaches to hold somerset's hand, but he withdraws it,
     wipes his tears away.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   if you... if you decide not to have the
                   baby... if that's what you decide, then
                   never tell mills you were pregnant.
                   i mean that.  never tell.
                           (pause)
                   your marriage would just wither, and die
                   altogether.

     tracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   but, if you decide to have the baby,
                   then, at that very instant, when you're
                   absolutely sure... tell him.  tell him
                   that exact second.  and, spoil that kid
                   every chance you get.

                                 tracy
                   somerset...

     somerset stands.  he forces a smile.

                                 somerset
                   that's all the wisdom i can share with
                   you, tracy.  i barely know you.

                                 tracy
                   will i see you again, before you leave?

                                 somerset
                   probably not.  but, it's probably better
                   that way.

     somerset steps away, leaves.  tracy watches him go.
