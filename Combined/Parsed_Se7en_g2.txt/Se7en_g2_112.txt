     int.  john doe's apartment, main room -- night

     all attention is focused on the phone on doe's desk.  a tape
     recorder is rigged to the receiver.  mills and somerset enter.
     mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up.

                                 mills
                           (into phone)
                   hello... hello?

                           (from recorder)
                   i admire you, david.  imagine my
                   surprise on finding you at my doorstep.
                   i admire you more and more every day.

                                 mills
                           (into phone)
                   okay, john.  let's...

                                 john doe (v.o.)
                           (from recorder)
                   no, no, no!  you listen and don't talk.
                   i suppose you found the painting and the
                   photos.  this is just as well.  now we
                   all know we've all seen each other.
                           (pause)
                   i mean what i say.  i do admire you.

     long pause.  mills waits.

                                 john doe (v.o.,cont)
