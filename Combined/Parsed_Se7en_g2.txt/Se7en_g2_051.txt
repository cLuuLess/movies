     int.  precinct house, somerset's office -- day

     it still rains outside.  somerset enters, stops to notice
     detective mills painted on the door where his name used to be.
     he walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk
     and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner.

     somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files
     and papers.  mills enters carrying the box of books.

                                 somerset
                   how's it coming?

                                 mills
                   great.

     mills puts the box on the large desk.  they both settle in,
     attending to their work.  two men, about five feet apart, each
     trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.

     mills takes out his cliff notes, looks to see somerset is
     occupied, hides them in a desk drawer.

     somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  there's a
     chalk board nailed to the wall.

     on the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath
                            2 greed(x)       6 pride
                            3 sloth          7 lust
                            4 envy

     the phone rings.  both men look at it.  phone rings again.

                                 somerset
                   it's your name on the door.

     mills picks up.  somerset returns to his work.

                                 mills
                           (into phone)
                   detective mills here.
                           (lowers voice)
                   honey, i asked you not to call unless...
                           (listens)
                   what... why?  okay... okay.  hold on.

     mills is confused.  he holds the phone out to somerset.

                                 mills (cont)
                   it's my wife.

     somerset looks quizzical.  mills shrugs.  somerset takes it.

                                 somerset
                           (into phone)
                   hello?
                           (listens)
                   yes, well... i appreciate the thought,
                   but... i...
                           (listens)
                   well, i guess i'd be delighted to.
                   thank you... goodbye.

     somerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled.  mills is waiting.

                                 mills
                   well?

                                 somerset
                   i'm invited to have a late supper with
                   you and your wife.  and i accept.

                                 mills
                   how's that?

                                 somerset
                           (sits back down)
                   tonight.

     mills looks at the phone, lost.
