     int.  underground waterworks -- night

     mills climbs onto a catwalk.  he passes tunnels, looking down
     each, intense, ready to kill.  a waterfall flows and over the
     other end of the catwalk.

     mills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and
     other tunnels.  he points his gun and fires into a far tunnel.

                                 mills
                   come on!  let's do it!  you and me!

     a figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind mills.

                                 mills (cont)
                   i'm not going to let you win this!

     john doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses.

     he seems calm, unloads his gun into mills' back... blam, blam...

     mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his
     bullet-proof vest.  blam, blam, blam... he stumbles, trying to
     turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to
     the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand.

     click.  doe's gun is empty.  the gunshots echo.  mills lays
     there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in
     his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them.

     doe moves quickly, starts searching mills' pockets.
