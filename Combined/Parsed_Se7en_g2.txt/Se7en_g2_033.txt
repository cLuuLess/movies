     int.  precinct house, captain's office -- early evening

     an office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is
     meticulously well kept.  the captain, 50, sits at his tidy desk.
     he's dressed conservatively.  mills and somerset sit before him.
     somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.

                                 somerset
                           (reading)
                   "one pound of flesh, no more no less. no
                   cartilage, no bone, but only flesh.
                   this task done, and he would go free."

     the captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without
     fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his
     neck and jaw to pulse.

     somerset stands, paces.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   this victim, mr. gold, was tied down
                   nude, holding a carving knife.  and he
                   was given a long time... to decide.
                   where to make the first cut?  there's a
                   gun to your head... but, what part or
                   parts of your body are expendable?

     mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious,
     doesn't know why they're here.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   mr. gold tried for the whole pound at
                   once, his love handle.  but, he went
                   into shock.  bled to death.

                                 captain
                   what is the point, somerset?

                                 somerset
                   look at both killings together.  this
                   murderer is an artist.

                                 captain
                   an artist?

                                 somerset
                   he uses colors and symbols.  he
                   positions the bodies after death, so
                   he's working with composition.  it's
                   been premeditated so meticulously... and
                   this is just the beginning.

                                 captain
                   wrong.  for all we know, we might never
                   hear from him again, and i don't want
                   that kind of talk floating around.

     somerset shakes his head "no."

                                 somerset
                   the rats and the pennies.  the circle
                   and the triangle on the wall.  there's
                   something about them... these murders
                   mean something.

                                 captain
                   so?  what?

     somerset has no answer.  the captain is irked, jaw clenching.

                                 captain (cont)
                           (to mills)
                   you with him, or you just here to watch?

                                 mills
                   this is his stuff, captain.  i've been
                   out in the cold most of the day.

                                 captain
                           (to somerset)
                   always working overtime up in that big
                   brain of yours, huh?  always cooking.

                                 somerset
                   i need you to know... i want us
                   reassigned.  we're declining this case.

                                 mills
                           (sits up, angry)
                   what?!

                                 captain
                   what the hell are you talking about?

                                 somerset
                   this cannot be my last duty here.  it's
                   going to go on and on.

                                 captain
                   you've left unfinished business before.

                                 somerset
                   everything else was taken as close to a
                   conclusion as humanly possible.

                                 mills
                   can i just say something?

                                 somerset
                   also... i don't think this should be
                   mills' first case.

                                 mills
                   this is not my first case, fuckhead!

                                 captain
                   i don't have anyone else to give this
                   to, somerset.  and nobody's going to
                   swap with you.

                                 mills
                   give it to me, then.  there's nothing
                   that says i have to fly with him.

     the captain considers this.

                                 mills (cont)
                   if somerset wants out, fuck him.

                                 somerset
                   it would be too much for him, too soon.

                                 mills
                           (to captain)
                   could we talk about this in private?

     the captain looks at somerset, then at mills.

                                 captain
                   that's not necessary.  you're in.

                                 mills
                   thank you, sir.

                                 captain
                   start picking up the pieces.  i'll
                   shuffle some paper and try to get you a
                   new partner.

     mills stands.  somerset will not look him in the eye.  mills
     leaves, slams the door.  somerset seems deflated.

                                 captain (cont)
                   you win, somerset.  you're out.
