     ext.  city streets -- night

     a block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.  stray, wild dogs
     roam in a pack.  a car turns down this street.  it's john doe's
     car, moving fast.  its headlights go out and it cruises,
     avoiding garbage cans in the street.

     follow the dark car.  ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the
     only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and
     blues of police activity.
