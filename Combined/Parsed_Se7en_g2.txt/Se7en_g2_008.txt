     ext.  chinese bodega/city streets -- night

     david mills, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  he is
     a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
     smoldering.  follow as he walks quickly past iron-gated
     storefronts.  he crosses the street under elevated subway
     tracks.  a train roars overhead.

     mills watches it as he walks on.

     blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate mills,
     throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.
