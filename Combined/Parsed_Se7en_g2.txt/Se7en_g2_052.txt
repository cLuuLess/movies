     int.  mill's apartment, living room/kitchenette -- night

     a record player on a moving box plays quiet music.

     there's a basketball game with no volume on the t.v. screen.
     tracy, mills and somerset eat at the kitchen table.  mills has a
     beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently.

                                 tracy
                   why aren't you married, somerset?

                                 mills
                   tracy.  what the hell?

     somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking.

                                 somerset
                   i was close.  it just didn't happen.

                                 tracy
                   it surprises me you're not married.  it
                   really does.

                                 somerset
                   any person who spends a significant
                   amount of time with me finds me...
                   disagreeable.  just ask your husband.

                                 mills
                   no argument.

     mills grins, but he means it.  he sips beer.  the conversation
     lapses into long silence.  somerset concentrates on his plate.
     tracy looks at mills, who eats while watching the basketball
     game.

                                 tracy
                           (to somerset)
                   how long have you lived here?

                                 somerset
                   too long.  much too long.
                           (drinks)
                   what do you think of our fair city?

                                 tracy
                   you take the bad with the good, i
                   suppose.  it's... it's...

                                 mills
                   it takes time to settle in.

     tracy looks at mills.  somerset can see it is a sore subject.

                                 somerset
                           (to tracy)
                   you'll get used to it pretty quickly.
                   there are things in any big city that
                   stand out at first.  but...

     a low rumbling is heard as plates begin to rattle and clatter.

                                 tracy
                   subway train.  it's right below us/

     the dishes clatter more.  coffee cups clink against their
     saucers.  tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it
     is nothing, but she is clearly bothered.

                                 tracy (cont)
                   it'll go away in a minute.

     they wait.  the t.v. picture goes fuzzy.  the rumbling grows
     louder, knocks something over in the sink.  mills continues
     eating.  somerset fiddles with his food.  the record player
     skips, then plays on.  the rumbling finally dies down, till
     everything is normal.

                                 mills
                           (uncomfortable)
                   this real estate guy... a real scum,
                   brought us to see this place a few
                   times.  and, it was nice enough, and the
                   price was right.  i was thinking it was
                   nothing, but i started to notice, he
                   kept hurrying us along.  i mean what
                   could it be?  why would he only show it
                   like five minutes at a time, before he'd
                   hustle us out the door?

     mills laughs, lamely.

                                 tracy
                   we found out the first night.

     somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.

                                 somerset
                   i'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.

     he pulls himself together, but only for a moment.  he can't stop
     it, laughs harder, covering his mouth.  tracy and mills laugh.

                                 mills
                           (sighs)
                   oh, fuck.
