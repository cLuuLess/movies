     int.  slum tenement building, stairwell -- morning

     crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots.

     the five cops from the briefing, fully geared up, rifles and
     handguns held, move quickly up the stairs, single-file.
     somerset and mills follow, guns out.  somerset is sweating
     bullets.  mills is juiced.
