     int.  safe house -- night

     the room is plain, like the room mrs. gold was kept in.  the
     door opens and tracy and mills enter.  they look sleepy,
     carrying suitcases.  a uniformed cop closes the door for them.

     mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while tracy looks
     around, depressed, distant.  the lighting is bad.  there are no
     decorations, no windows.  a wide crack runs down one wall.

     tracy sits down on the bed.  mills notices her discontent.

                                 mills
                   it won't be for long, honey.  i swear.
                   this is just till this is over.

                                 tracy
                   i know.

     mills goes to sit beside her.  he puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                 mills
                   i'm sorry.

     tracy nods.  she stands, goes to start turning down the covers.

                                 tracy
                   i know.  it can't be helped.

     mills feels useless, powerless.  he goes to the suitcase and
     starts unpacking the contents.  tracy continues turning down the
     sheets.
