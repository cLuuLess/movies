     int.  precinct house, hallway -- night

     somerset and mills come from the print lab.  a janitor is
     mopping the hall.  the computer is heard whirring and clicking
     onwards.  somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the
     door.  mills flops beside him.

                                 somerset
                   you really meant what you said to mrs.
                   gold.  you really believe we'll get him,
                   don't you?

                                 mills
                   and you don't?

                                 somerset
                   i wish i still thought like you.  i'm so
                   far gone from that.

                                 mills
                   so, tell me what you think we're doing.

                                 somerset
                   all we do is pick up the pieces.  we
                   take all the evidence... all the
                   pictures, statements.  write everything
                   down and note what time things happened.
                   we take it all, make a nice, neat pile
                   and file it away.  just in case it's
                   ever needed in a courtroom.

                                 mills
                   you're unbelievable.  in my entire life,
                   you're the oldest man i've ever met.

                                 somerset
                   i've seen even the most promising clues
                   lead to dead ends.  hundreds of times.

                                 mills
                   i've seen the same.  i'm not the country
                   hick-boy you seem to think i am.

     somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                                 somerset
                   in this city, if all the skeletons came
                   out of all the closets... if every un-
                   revenged corpse were to suddenly rise
                   and walk again, there would be no more
                   room for the living.

     mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.

                                 mills
                   don't try to tell me you didn't get that
                   rush tonight... that adrenalin.  like we
                   were getting somewhere.
                           (pause)
                   and, don't try to tell me it was because
                   you thought we found something that
                   would play well in a courtroom.

     somerset looks at mills, puffs the cigarette.  the computer is
     heard: whir - click - whir - click...
