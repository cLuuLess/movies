     ext.  another city street, porno district -- night

     people pass on the sidewalk.  john is amongst them, but he
     stops, looking up at something offscreen.

     he's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon:
     the hot house.  massage parlor.  the hot house's barker notices
     john's interest.

                                 barker
                   interesting isn't it, friend?  you like
                   that, you like girls, then come on in.

     john doesn't hear the barker.  steps up to study fading pictures
     of naked women massaging happy men.  nudity.

                                 barker (cont)
                   you'll see a lot more inside.  you'll
                   see a lot more than that.

     john's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the
     neon reflected in his thick glasses.
