     int.  basement gym, boxing ring -- day

     mills opens a door and enters with somerset behind.  they are
     alone.  chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring.  practice
     pads hang from pegs on a wall.  mills clasps a pair in his
     gloves, offers them to somerset.

                                 somerset
                   no.

                                 mills
                   you just hold them up.  i do all the
                   work.

     somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on.  he still has
     the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth.  mills climbs into
     the ring.  he holds the ropes open for somerset, waits.

     somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.

                                 mills (cont)
                   you've seen my files... seen the things
                   i've done?

                                 somerset
                   yes.  impressive work.

     mills motions to somerset and somerset holds up the practice
     pads.  mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.
     thwack... thwack...

                                 mills
                   so, what's your problem?  i've done my
                   time on door-to-doors, and walking a
                   beat.

                                 somerset
                   i know it.  that doesn't mean...

                                 mills
                   i did all that shit a long time ago.

     thwack... thwack... somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.

                                 somerset
                   i made a decision, because i have to
                   worry about the integrity of the scene.

                                 mills
                   that's bullshit.

                                 somerset
                   when i'm on scene, i'm not going to
                   worry whether you think you're getting
                   enough time on the playing field.  i'm
                   there to do the work.

     mills punches a little more aggressively.  somerset's backing,
     flinching, keeping the pads high.  thwack... thwack... thwack...

                                 mills
                   the badge in my pocket says "detective,"
                   just like yours.  i've been homicide for
                   four and a half years.

                                 somerset
                   you've worked homicide for four years,
                   or for five years...
                   don't count the half-years, unless you
                   want to sound like a rookie.

     mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into
     somerset's face, knocks somerset on his ass.

                                 mills
                   oops.  my hand slipped.

     mills walks, climbs out of the ring.

                                 mills (cont)
                   you fucked me over today, and you know
                   it.  you know it.

     somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth.  he
     contains his anger.  he seems to realize mills has a point.

                                 mills (cont)
                   just don't jerk me off.  that's all i
                   ask.  it's not much.  don't jerk me off.
                           (pause)
                   please, do me the favor of remembering
                   that.

     mills exits.  somerset spits out the broken cigarette.
