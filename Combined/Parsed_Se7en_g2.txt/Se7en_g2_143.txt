     int.  safe house -- night

     mills comes quietly into the bedroom.  tracy is asleep in the
     bed.  mills takes off his jacket, puts it down.  he sits on a
     chair and unties one shoe, takes it off.  he looks at tracy,
     looks at her a long time.

     he puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed.  he
     kisses tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently.  he
     is touched, saddened.  he kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms
     under and around her.  he holds tight, kisses her again.  tracy
     stirs.

                                 tracy
                   david?

     mills his face against her, holding tighter still.

                                 mills
                   i love you.

     tracy holds his face in her hands, sees that he is crying.

                                 tracy
                   david?

                                 mills
                   i love you.

     mills clings to her.  she wraps her arms around him as he cries
     quietly against her, and she kisses him, tries to comfort him.
     he sobs.
