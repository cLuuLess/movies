     int.  the hot house, red room -- afternoon

     mills and somerset enter.  rock music continues, loud.  a strobe
     light flashes from the ceiling onto two ambulance attendants.
     the first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse
     of a woman with long blonde hair.  the second attendant tries to
     examine the pupils of a crazed man, 55, who sits naked on the
     floor, wrapped in a sheet.  a cop holds the crazed man down.

                                 crazed man
                   he... he... he made me do it!

                                 second attendant
                   i have to look at you.  i have to look
                   at you.

     an x is scratched into the red paint on the wall.  mills and
     somerset move towards the covered body.

     there are apples on the bed and floor.  the rock music from
     outside suddenly stops.

                                 first attendant
                   you're not going to want to see this
                   more than once.

                                 crazed man
                   he had a gun!  he... he made me do it!

     the sheet is lifted for the detectives.  they grimace at what
     they see.  we do not see.  somerset closes his eyes and walks to
     face a wall, shaken.  the first attendant replaces the sheet.

     mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it.

                                 crazed man (o.s.,cont)
                   he made me do it!
