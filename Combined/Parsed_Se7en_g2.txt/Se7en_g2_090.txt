     int.  central library, outside librarian's office -- afternoon

     from a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look through a
     big window into the head librarian's office.  the elderly head
     librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard.
     mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off
     his pad to the librarian.

     we cannot hear them, but it's clear mills is excited as he walks
     back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her
     computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a
     dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper
     onto the floor.  back and forth goes mills, carrying the phone.
     he closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.

     the librarian finishes typing, sits back, done.  mills hangs up
     the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord
     drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.

     the librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books.  mills is
     apologizing.  he goes to watch the printer.  he tears the last
     sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper
     off the floor.

     prize in hand, mills is so grateful he bends to give the old
     woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even
     more annoyed.  mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of
     books.  before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the
     door.  mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.

     the librarian shakes her head in disgust.
