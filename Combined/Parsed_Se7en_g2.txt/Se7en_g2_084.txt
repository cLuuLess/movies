     mills is behind his paperwork covered desk, listening to a
     uniformed officer who looks over a report sheet.

                                 officer
                   zero's landlord said an envelope of cash
                   was in the office mailbox each month.
                   he says, quote, "i never heard a single
                   complaint from this guy and nobody ever
                   complained about him.  he's the best
                   tenant i ever had."

                                 mills
                   there's a landlord's dream tenant.  a
                   paralyzed man with no tongue.

                                 officer
                   who pays his rent on time.

                                 mills
                   bring me everything as soon as it's
                   transcribed.

     the officer leaves.  mills starts sorting through piles on his
     desk.  he doesn't know where to begin.

     he sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection
     of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the
     murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and
     black and white copies of pages from art books.

     he stares, thinking.  he stands, takes a photocopy off the wall.
     the killer's first note:

              dear detectives,
                   long is the way, and hard, that out
                   of hell leads up to the light.

                                 mills
                           (to himself)
                   milton.
