     int.  underground subway train -- day

     the train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, wheels
     screeching.  the lights go on and off.  passengers read
     tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the
     walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.

     all races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings.
     tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.

     a bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through
     the crowd.  a man presses against tracy in an attempt to let the
     bag-lady pass.  tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways
     to make room.  she looks down.

     on one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno
     magazine, three-way fuck, in one hand.  his other hand is in his
     pocket.  he's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  no
     one else notices or seems to care.

     tracy looks away, disgusted.  she closes her eyes.  the train's
     wheels screech louder as the train takes a curve.
