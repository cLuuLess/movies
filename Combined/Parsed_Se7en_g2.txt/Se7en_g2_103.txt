     int.  john doe's apartment, room two -- night

     somerset enters.  the ceiling light is on.  there are
     bookshelves on each wall, filled with thousands of notebooks.

     somerset takes one notebook down.  it is a thick composition
     book with a marbled black and white cover.  inside, the pages
     are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings.

     somerset takes down another notebook and opens it.  same as the
     first; scribbled sentences and sketches.

     he walks to another wall, pulls another notebook.  same deal.

                                 somerset
                   jesus christ.
