     int.  amtrack train -- later day

     the train is nearly full.  somerset has his suitcase on the
     aisle seat beside him.  he has a hardcover book unopened on his
     lap.  he still stares out the window, but his disposition has
     soured.  the train is passing an ugly, swampy field.

     a car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  a little
     further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their
     coats matted with blood.

     somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.

     away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.
