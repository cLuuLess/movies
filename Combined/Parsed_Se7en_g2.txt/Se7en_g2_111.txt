     int.  john doe's apartment, room two -- night

     somerset reads one of doe's notebooks.  three cops are looking
     through other notebooks from the shelves.  mills enters.

                                 somerset
                   we need to put more men on this.

                                 mills
                   i'm working on it, alright.  what have
                   we got.

     somerset bristles slightly at mills' abrupt demeanor.

                                 somerset
                   we've got about five thousand notebooks
                   in this room.  and, as near as i can
                   tell, each notebook contains two hundred
                   and fifty pages.

                                 mills
                   then, he must write about the murders.

     somerset looks at the notebook, reads.

                                 somerset
                   "what sick, silly puppets we are, and
                   what a gross stage we dance on.  what
                   fun we have, dancing around, not a care
                   in the world.  not knowing that we are
                   nothing.  we are not what god intended."
                           (turns pages)
                   "on the subway today, a man came up to
                   start a conversation.  he was making
                   small talk, this lonely man, talking
                   about the weather and other things.  i
                   tried to be accommodating, but my head
                   began to hurt from his banality.  i
                   almost didn't notice it had happened,
                   but i threw up all over him.  and i
                   couldn't stop myself from laughing."
                           (closes book)
                   no dates indicated.  they're placed on
                   the shelves in no discernible order.  he
                   describes a scab on his arm for five
                   pages, then writes about existential
                   philosophy on the next.

     mills walks.  he looks into the adjoining paint room.

                                 somerset (cont)
                   it's just his mind poured out on paper.

     mills leans in the doorway, looking at doe's strange artworks.

                                 mills
                   you were right.  he is preaching.

     the phone rings in the other room.
