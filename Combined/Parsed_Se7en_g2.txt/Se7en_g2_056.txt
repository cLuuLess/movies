     ext.  slum tenements -- night

     two twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath
     the span of a bridge.  the streets are littered with garbage.
     teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store.  cars
     pass slowly, car stereos pumping out hip hop.

     under the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two
     dumpsters.  the trunk is open.

     at the back of the car

     the trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of
     tall, orange candles.  hundreds of candles.  john leans in under
     the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents:

     a plastic bottle of prescription pills.  a bottle of aspirin.  a
     hypodermic needle filled with liquid.  lastly, many jars of baby
     food: strained carrots, strained spinach, creamed corn, etc.
