     int.  mills' apartment, living room/kitchenette -- later night

     the record player spins a different album, different music.
     tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink.  mills and
     somerset have beers.

                                 somerset
                   all television does is teach children
                   that it's really cool to be stupid and
                   eat candy bars all day.

                                 tracy
                   i don't think i've ever met anyone who
                   didn't have a television.

     tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours.

                                 mills
                   that's weird.  it's un-american.

     somerset shrugs.

                                 mills (cont)
                   what about sports?

                                 somerset
                   what about them?

     tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table.

                                 mills
                   you go to movies at least.

                                 somerset
                   i read.  remember reading?  what's the
                   last book you read, mills?

                                 mills
                   t.v. guide.

     mills laughs.  burps.  he turns to tracy.

                                 mills (cont)
                   excuse me.
                           (to somerset)
                   i just have to say, i can't respect any
                   man who's never seen green acres.

     somerset gives a blank stare.  tracy walks away.

                                 mills (cont)
                   you've never seen the odd couple?  the
                   flintstones?

                                 somerset
                   i vaguely recall wilma, and someone
                   named... dino.

     across the room, tracy turns the t.v. and the record player off.
     she goes into the bedroom, shuts the door behind her without a
     word.  somerset and mills turn to the closed door.

     they look at each other, then sit for a time.  somerset drinks
     coffee.  mills drums his fingers on his beeper.  big silence.
