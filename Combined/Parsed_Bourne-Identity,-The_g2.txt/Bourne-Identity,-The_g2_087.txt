               int. the paris apartment -- day

               the apartment -- bourne in motion -- five things at once -- 
               checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the 
               red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and --

                                     the concierge
                              (still outside the 
                              door--)
                         --i'm calling the police, mr.  bourne -- 
                         you give me no choice -- i'm calling 
                         them right away! --

                                     bourne
                         -- your shoes -- marie! -- where? -- 
                         where are your shoes? -- marie --

               marie standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the 
               picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just 
               happened --

                                     marie
                         he's dead isn't he?

                                     bourne
                         marie -- look at me -- there's no 
                         time for this --

                                     marie
                         he went out the window -- why? -- 
                         why would someone do that?

                                     bourne
                         -- we can't stay here -- i can't 
                         stay here -- it's not safe here --

                                     marie
                         he came to kill us.

                                     bourne
                         -- we can go -- i can get us out of 
                         here -- but we have to go now --

                                     marie
                         you knew he was coming.

                                     bourne
                         no.

                                     marie
                         i trusted you.

                                     bourne
                         you're wrong. i didn't know.

                                     marie
                         i don't trust anybody and i trusted 
                         you!

                                     bourne
                         i didn't know this would happen.

                                     marie
                         he had my picture! he knew i was 
                         here! he came here to kill us!

                                     bourne
                         and where is he now?
                              (that gets her quiet)
                         you believe what you want, but i'm 
                         telling you the truth -- i never 
                         would have brought you here if i 
                         thought it was dangerous.

                                     marie
                              (totally overwhelmed)
                         oh, jesus...

                                     bourne
                         you stay -- if you want, you stay -- 
                         it's okay -- it's better -- maybe 
                         it's better -- i don't know --
                              (starting to back 
                              away --)
                         but i can't stay here. i can't.

                                     marie
                         but the police --

                                     bourne
                         -- there's no time --

                                     marie
                         -- we'll explain it --

                                     bourne
                         -- how? --

                                     marie
                         -- there's two of us -- we'll tell 
                         them -- we'll just --

                                     bourne
                         -- forget it --

                                     marie
                         -- we'll tell them what happened --

                                     bourne
                         i don't know what happened!
                              (huge here)
                         i don't know who he is! i don't know 
                         what he wants! i don't even know who 
                         i am! the only thing i know is that 
                         if i stay here, i'm never gonna find 
                         out!

               bourne -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it 
               on -- just about to make his move --

               she's standing there. just utterly swamped. lost.

                                     bourne
                         come with me.
                              (she turns back, he's 
                              waiting --)
                         i can get us out of here. i know it. 
                         then we can think. then we can work 
                         it out. we'll explain it then.  once 
                         we're safe.
                              (rock solid)
                         i can protect you.
