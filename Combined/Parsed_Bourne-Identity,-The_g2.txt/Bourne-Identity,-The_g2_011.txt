               int. fishing boat head -- night

               one of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. the man standing 
               before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. staring at 
               himself.

               and then he speaks.

                                     the man
                              (in perfect french)
                         i don't know who i am. do you know 
                         who i am? do have any idea who i am?

               and then he stops. blinks. wipes away the perspiration just 
               beading on his forehead.

                                     the man
                              (in perfect dutch)
                         tell me who i am. if you know who i 
                         am, please stop fucking around and 
                         tell me.

               no answer. just that face. his face. who am i?

               and what else is inside there?
