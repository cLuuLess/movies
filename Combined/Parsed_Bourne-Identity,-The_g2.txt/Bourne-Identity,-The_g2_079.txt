               ext. french roadside -- dawn

               beautiful morning. the red car parked along the road. bourne 
               alone in the passenger seat. deep asleep. nestled there.

               and then, he wakes suddenly. starts. freaked for a moment. 
               instantly feeling for the red bag. there it is in his lap. 
               he looks around and --

               marie sitting away from the car. she's got a loaf of bread. 
               a soda. smoking a butt. same clothes, but her make-up's been 
               washed away. clean. simple. gorgeous.

               bourne steps out. morning legs.

                                     marie

                                     bourne
                         where are we?

                                     marie
                         we're about an hour away.

                                     bourne
                         i can't believe i slept.

                                     marie
                         you were tired. here...
                              (bread and soda --)
                         for twenty-thousand i like to throw 
                         in breakfast.
                              (he takes it)
                         so what do you dream about?

                                     bourne
                         i dream i'm asleep. i dream that i'm 
                         asleep and i can't wake up.
                              (he takes a hit from 
                              her smoke and coughs --)
                         i don't think i smoke.

               another silence. she's watching him.

                                     marie
                         you ever think maybe you have a 
                         family?

                                     bourne
                         i thought about it. i don't know.

               she looks away. was she hoping for another answer?

                                     marie
                         i guess it's like christmas every 
                         day for you, huh?
