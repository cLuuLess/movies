               bourne and marie looking back nervously -- so far all over --

               on the street

               in blood -- the cop racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for 
               long because the professor is firing at him and --

               now the professor is moving -- not running -- just a swift

               a motorcyclist comes flying down the street -- oblivious --

               swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean 
               and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

               the professor grabs the bike and takes off -- shooting at 
               two police cars just racing to the scene and we are into --
