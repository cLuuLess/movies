               ext. zurich park -- night

               the man trying to get comfortable on a bench. it's chilly 
               but this will have to do until morning.

               just settling in, when --

                                     zurich cop #1 (o.s.)
                              (authority german)
                         can't you read the signs?

               the man turns. two zurich cops coming toward him.

                                     zurich cop #2
                         on your feet. let's go. right now.

               the man makes his feet. they're on top of him now.

                                     zurich cop #1
                         the park is closed. there's no 
                         sleeping in the park.

                                     zurich cop #2
                         let's see some identification.

               the man not sure what to do. eyes moving. mouth shut.

                                     zurich cop #1
                         come on. your papers. let's go.

                                     the man
                         i've lost them. i've...
                              (german now)
                         my papers. they are lost.

                                     zurich cop #1
                              (not sympathetic)
                         okay. let's go. put your hands up.

                                     zurich cop #2
                              (pulling his nightstick)
                          -- come on -- hands up -- up --

               the man raising his hand slowly -- zurich cop #1 reaching up 
               to pat him down --

                                     the man
                         -- look, i'm just trying to sleep 
                         okay? --
                              (german again)
                          -- i just need to sleep --

               zurich cop #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with 
               the nightstick -- into the man's back -- and that's the last 
               thing he'll remember because --

               the man is in motion.

               a single turn -- spinning -- catching cop #2 completely off 
               guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat 
               and --

               cop #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but 
               the man -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single 
               fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

               cop #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to 
               fight back but -- the man -- like a machine -- just 
               unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down- 
               down and -- cop #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood 
               spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

               cop #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air -- 
               struggling with his holster -- the man -- his foot -- down -- 
               like a vise -- onto cop #2's arm -- shattering the bone -- 
               cop #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

               the man -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's 
               got it right up against cop #2's forehead -- right on the 
               edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

                                     zurich cop #2
                              (gasping, pleading)
                         -- no -- please god no -- please 
                         don't -- please no -- my go

               -- stopping as --

               the man slams the gun against his temple and --

               this fight is over.

               the man standing there. in the silence. two unconscious cops 
               at his feet. blood on his pants. what just happened? how did 
               he do this? and there's the gun in his hand. and god, it 
               just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down -- 
               holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done 
               a million times before...

               this is something he definitely knows how to do.

               and then he stops cold. throwing down the gun. running off 
               into the darkness --
