               int. treadstone -- day

               a deep, inner office. an ops office. operations. unlabeled 
               and anonymous. a backwater project center hidden deep within 
               the langley facility. utilitarian. several rooms linked like 
               a suite.

               small staff. several technicians. one or two for 
               communications. a couple for research. people are at their 
               posts. and it's all quiet. but they are busy. quietly urgent. 
               this is a place under siege.

               zorn is the number two here. brilliant bloodless lapdog. 
               he's coming through the suite. coming through quickly. heading 
               toward the boss's little office at the back --

               ted conklin. ivy league ollie north. buttoned down. square 
               jaw. everything tucked away. but there's tension in the air. 
               work on the desk. cot in the corner.

                                     conklin
                              (looking up)
                         what?

                                     zorn
                         abbott wants to talk.

                                     conklin
                         tell him we're busy.

                                     zorn
                         i tried.
