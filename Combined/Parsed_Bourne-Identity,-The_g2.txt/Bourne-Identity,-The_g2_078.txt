               int. wombosi's paris compound -- night

               quick orientation: picture a heavily-walled palace just off 
               the bois du boulogne. but once inside you could be back in 
               brazzaville. it's just a buffet of oddness. home to fifty 
               children and nine wives. the decor blends money and nouveau 
               riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic. 
               it's a visual treat. not condescending or stupid, but flat-
               out strange and menacing.

               it's late. and the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry 
               all that through this next series of quick shots --

               wombosi house security station

               just inside the door. bodyguard #1 slouched before a bank of 
               security monitors.

               wombosi main hallway

               littered with toys. children's crap everywhere. bodyguard 
               #3. snoozing on a louis quatorze chair draped with african 
               cloth.

               wombosi throne room doors

               deauvage -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing 
               set of doors. he's trying to stay awake. reading a spy 
               thriller.

               finally to

               wombosi's throne room

               and there he is -- the emperor himself -- wombosi on his 
               throne. except the room is dark and empty. and he's sitting 
               there by himself. a king without a country.

               sitting there. with a gun in his lap. drinking hard from a 
               bottle of jack daniels.

               stewing.
