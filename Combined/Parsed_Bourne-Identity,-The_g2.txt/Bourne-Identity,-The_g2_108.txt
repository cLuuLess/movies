               int. paris morgue front desk -- night

               the two morgue attendants watching bourne put down a hundred 
               dollar bill. marie standing a little off -- she will not be 
               comfortable in the morgue.

                                     attendant #1
                              (picking up the cash)
                         what was the name again?

                                     bourne
                         kane. john michael kane.

                                     attendant #2
                         it's number 121.

                                     bourne
                         i want to see the body.

                                     attendant #1
                         our boss could come back. we're not 
                         supposed to.

               bourne pulling out another hundred and --

               morgue freezer room

               it's showtime. marie back by the door. bourne right on it. 
               attendant #1 pulling open the freezer and...

               bourne sags. attendant #1 looking baffled.

                                     marie
                         what?

               insert -- freezer #121 -- it's empty.

                                     morgue boss (o.s.)
                              (from behind them --)
                         what the hell's going on here?

               here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk?

                                     attendant #1
                         this guy, he came to see the american, 
                         but the body, it's missing.

                                     morgue boss
                         they came last night.  his brother.

                                     attendant #2
                         it's not in the book.

                                     morgue boss
                         who are these people?
                              (now english to bourne)
                         who are you? what's going on here?

                                     bourne
                         where did this body go?

                                     morgue boss
                         i said, someone came last night --
                              (big attitude now)
                         look, this isn't a carnival -- people 
                         call and they make an appointment 
                         and they follow the rules -- everyone 
                         signs in and out -- this is a serious 
                         place -- serious work -- it's not 
                         just to come in whenever you like --

                                     bourne
                              (like a shot)
                         shit, we didn't sign in.

                                     morgue boss
                         so get the hell out of here.

                                     bourne
                         fine. but i'd like to sign in. in 
                         fact, i insist on it. where's the 
                         book? i gotta sign in --
                              (off and running now --)

               everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --

               front desk area

               bourne there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --

                                     bourne
                         is this it? --
                              (the book)
                         -- this is it, right? --

                                     morgue boss
                         -- slow down -- you can't just take 
                         the book like that --

                                     bourne
                         -- don't sweat it, i have a pen -- 
                         no problem -- just let me find the 
                         page --
                              (then quick to marie)
                         -- honey, why don't you wait for me 
                         outside, okay? --

               marie trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's 
               doing --

                                     morgue boss
                         -- we have rules here, this is a 
                         very serious place -- i'm the one 
                         who decides who gets in here, okay? --

                                     bourne
                         -- what do i? -- i put the name of 
                         the person i came to see? --

                                     morgue boss
                         -- this is serious business down 
                         here and we cannot have people coming 
                         and going --

                                     bourne
                         -- here we go -- i found it --

               but he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out 
               of the book --

                                     morgue boss
                         -- what are you? -- what are you 
                         doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped 
                         the book! -- you stupid fucki--
                              (no chance to finish 
                              this, because --)

               bourne just slammed him against the wall. hard. like a tractor 
               hit him. and fast.

               and that shuts up the room.

               the two attendants rushing to help their boss --

               bourne grabbing marie and pulling her out the door --
