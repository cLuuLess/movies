               int. paris apartment -- day

               a huge, rambling flat. large entry hallway. large rooms beyond 
               that. it's obviously expensive. but cold. completely 
               impersonal. no photographs. no mementoes. no human history.

               we're moving now

               the living room

               bourne and marie exploring.

                                     marie
                         it's big.

               bourne silent. struggling to get a feel for the place.

                                     marie
                         this is like a real apartment.
                              (she likes it)
                         this is really yours?

                                     bourne
                         i guess so.

               marie taking it in fast. bourne seems paralyzed. trying to 
               soak it all in. willing himself home. touching things as he 
               passes. as if a texture, a smell -- something will become 
               familiar. he's deep into this as we go to --

               the bedroom

               marie in the doorway. checking it out. it's so clean and 
               simple. but it's not the decor she's most interested in...

               marie opening an armoire...

               nothing but men's clothes. no competition. she's feeling 
               better by the moment as we go to --

               the kitchen

               like a stage set. lots of props and no sign of food. bourne 
               picking up a frying pan.

                                     bourne
                         this is my frying pan.
                              (and then --)
                         this is my spoon.
                              (trying harder)
                         i'm jason bourne and this is my 
                         kitchen.

               the master bathroom

               marie still on the prowl. mirror city. big tub. one 
               toothbrush.

               an office study

               there's a desk. chair. phone. basic. bourne with a folder in 
               his hand. staring at the bookshelves. binders, reference 
               materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime 
               law. ship schedules. registry catalogs. all about boats.

                                     marie
                         this is your office?
                              (from the doorway)
                         god, you live like a monk...

                                     bourne
                         all this stuff -- it's all about 
                         boats.
                              (looking up)
                         i think i'm in the shipping business.

                                     marie
                         see. it's starting to come back, 
                         yeah?
                              (he sort of nods)
                         you mind if i take a bath?

                                     bourne
                         go ahead.

               marie backs out. bourne alone again. standing there for a 
               moment. dealing with it.

               and then he sits down in a chair.

               bourne sitting there. staring. the room, the desk -- it's 
               all so devoid of personality. and then, something catches 
               his eye and --

               insert -- the desk top -- a faint silhouette through the 
               dust and grime. outlines of where a computer used to sit.

               bourne reaching suddenly under the desk. bingo. pulling out 
               a retractable computer keyboard tray. but it's empty. no 
               keyboard. now he's really confused and --

               insert -- a phone/answering machine -- bourne pressing the 
               playback button and --

                                     phone machine
                         "you have no messages."

               bourne leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and 
               then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker 
               phone -- and then hitting redial and --

               the phone stars dialing...

               ringing and...

                                     operator/phone
                         bonjour, hotel marboeuf...

               bourne quick grabbing the receiver. taking it off speakerphone 
               and --

                                     bourne
                         ...yes -- oui -- uh...

                                     operator/phone
                         yes, sir. hotel marboeuf, paris.

                                     bourne

                                     operator/phone
                         yes, sir...
                              (switching to english, 
                              thinking that's his 
                              problem --)
                         how can i help you?

                                     bourne
                         yes, i'm...i'm looking for mr. jason 
                         bourne.

                         one moment, please...
                              (a long pause, and 
                              then --)
                         i'm afraid, i have no one by that 
                         name registered, sir.

                                     bourne
                         d'accord... merci.
                              (about to hang up--)
                         un moment -- un moment --

                                     operator/phone
                         -- sir? --

                                     bourne
                         -- hang on -- i need you to check 
                         another name for me -- hang on -- un 
                         moment, s'il vous plait --

               bourne grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where 
               is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --

               there it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of 
               card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

                                     bourne
                              (reading it)
                         kane. do you have mr. john michael 
                         kane?

                                     operator/phone
                         one moment, sir.

               bourne waiting. and then there's muzak -- holding music and --

               the master bathroom

               water running in the tub. marie pulling off her boots. 
               checking the temperature.

               the office study

               bourne still on hold. and then --

                                     manager/phone
                              (a new voice suddenly)
                         bonjour? monsieur? allo...

                                     bourne
                         yes, i'm here...

                                     manager/phone
                         you call about monsieur kane? john 
                         michael kane?

                                     bourne
                         yes. is he there?

                                     manager/phone
                         you are a friend of his?

                                     bourne
                         yes.

                                     manager/phone
                         i have some very bad news for you, 
                         sir. i'm terrible sorry to have to 
                         tell you this, but monsieur kane has 
                         passed away almost two weeks ago...

               silence. bourne is rocked. but the manager, it's natural, he 
               interprets the silence as grief...

                                     manager/phone
                         there was an accident. on the 
                         motorway. apparently, he was killed 
                         instantly. really, i'm terrible sorry 
                         to be the one to tell you this...

                                     bourne
                         ...i understand...

                                     manager/phone
                         ...we actually, we were unaware for 
                         several days that this had happened. 
                         when they came for his things, it 
                         was made known for us, you see?

                                     bourne
                         who? who came?

                                     manager/phone
                         his brother. you know his brother?

                                     bourne
                         right. yes. of course.

                                     manager/phone
                         it's very bad this. terrible sad. 
                         such a young man.

                                     bourne
                         do you -- his brother -- do you have 
                         a phone number?

                                     manager/phone
                         i think not...
                              (quick french to 
                              someone in the office 
                              there --)
                         no, i'm sorry. it was very sudden. 
                         he was here very briefly.

               bourne just hands up the phone. just like that. not even 
               goodbye. standing there frozen. stunned. john michael kane 
               is dead. and he had the passport.

               suddenly, everything's changed. they shouldn't be here. this 
               is bad. danger.

               the master bathroom

               marie playing with her hair in the mirror. checking the water --

                                     marie
                              (calling out to him --)
                         she wasn't kidding about the water. 
                         it's freezing.

               the office

               bourne frozen there. on alert. he forces a smile. decoy mood.

                                     bourne
                         hang on. i'll check the kitchen...
                              (moving out of the 
                              office --)
                         maybe it takes a while to get all 
                         the way upstairs.

               the kitchen

               bourne moving to the sink. he's smiling. upbeat. but it's an 
               act. his eyes are everywhere. turning on the water. but 
               ignoring it. what he's really doing is searching out a weapon. 
               pulling a knife very quietly from behind the stove. holding 
               it. feels pretty comfortable. hiding it down by his side. on 
               the move again, now --

                                     bourne
                         yeah, it's cold in here, too...
                              (calling to her as he 
                              goes --)
                         let's give it another minute.

               bourne like we've ever seen him. like an animal. every sound -- 
               every breeze -- everything carries information.

               standing still. taking it all in.

               real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that 
               face out to the street below. the hallway to the bedroom and 
               bath feeds into the living room from one side. there is a 
               large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. simple 
               furniture.

                                     marie
                              (suddenly --)
                         -- omigod! --
                              (she's behind him --)
                         -- what're you? -- no -- no --

               marie backing away -- completely freaked -- bourne standing 
               there with the knife in his hand and --

                                     bourne
                         -- no -- marie -- no! -- it's not 
                         like that --

                                     bourne

               marie -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment --

               bourne glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him -- 
               motioning for marie to get down -- do it -- now -- down!

               marie hesitating and --

               bourne -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb 
               from a lamp beside him and --

               marie about to say something -- he shakes her off --

               castel -- he's in the airshaft! -- hanging from an abseil 
               rope -- but off guard -- firing blind -- strafing the

               rounds tearing across the ceiling and --

               marie -- screaming now -- trying to crawl away and --

               castel -- no chance -- off balance -- bourne -- his open 
               palm driving up into castel's jaw -- the body wants to fall 
               backward, but bourne has the guy's arm in his free hand -- 
               jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and --

               the gun clattering free across the floor and --

               bourne -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into castel's 
               gut -- and then down -- his foot -- down into castel's knee, 
               shattering it and --

               castel is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring 
               blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone 
               torn through his pant leg above the knee and --
