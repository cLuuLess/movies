               int. marie's car

               bourne driving. marie looking back -- seeing the professor 
               gain on them --

                                     marie
                         xxxxxx

                                     bourne
                         xxxxxx

               and -- the professor fires -- shreds the back off their car --

                                     marie
                         give me the gun --

               and now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window.

                                     bourne
                         wait 'till he's close.

               bourne swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street -- 
               slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection 
               and --

               in the intersection

               cars coming the other way, bourne just makes it through -- 
               the professor tries to squeeze through -- skidding and --

               crack! the professor hits the front of a car sideways on his 
               bike -- he is thrown clear through the intersection, right 
               into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

               he gets up, grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike 
               and now we see --
