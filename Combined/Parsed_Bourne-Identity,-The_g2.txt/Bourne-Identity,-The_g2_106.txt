               int. peter rawlins' office -- day

               meet rawlins. he's a young, jolly brit -- pink and overfed -- 
               and quite shocked to see...

                                     rawlins
                         mr. kane...
                              (hastily tidying up)
                         come right in... please... have a 
                         seat.

                                     bourne
                         thanks.

               bourne just trying to feel his way through this...

                                     rawlins
                         well...
                              (really thrown)
                         i must admit, when my assistant told 
                         me you were here i was, really -- i 
                         was quite -- i was surprised.

                                     bourne
                         really.

                                     rawlins
                         we thought you were gone for good.

                                     bourne
                         did you?

                                     rawlins
                         well, i mean it's a tough business, 
                         isn't it? cutthroat.

               a long awkward beat. neither of them sure where to go.

                                     rawlins
                              (finally)
                         look, our bid -- it was competitive -- 
                         but definitely at the high end of 
                         competitive -- when we didn't hear 
                         back from you, we did some re-analysis 
                         of the numbers, and honestly, we'd 
                         really like a chance to do a bit 
                         better.
                              (pitching now)
                         i'm assuming you're still in the 
                         market. it's the same vessel?

                                     bourne
                         yes.

                                     rawlins
                         we just picked up a job quite like 
                         the one we were bidding for you. 
                         gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- 
                         five-foot pleasure cruiser. i think 
                         we learned a few things that might 
                         allow us to make our proposal for 
                         your job, as i said, a bit more 
                         competitive.

                                     bourne
                         okay.

               another beat. rawlins holding back until now...

                                     rawlins
                         was it the break-in?

                                     bourne
                         excuse me?

                                     rawlins
                         we also thought we hadn't heard from 
                         you -- we've had a bit of a publicity 
                         nightmare, people have been talking.
                              (the meat)
                         our offices were broken into -- 
                         vandalism mostly -- shortly after we 
                         last spoke.

                                     bourne
                         i hadn't heard.

               rawlins smiles. reset. sales mode.

                                     rawlins
                         let me get you a new copy of the 
                         proposal.

                                     bourne
                         that'd be great.
