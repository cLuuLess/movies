               int. the hotel room -- night

               it's really late. bourne enters the room. marie in the corner. 
               smoked out. cried out. lifed out.

               silence. not a word.

               his shirt is torn to shit. he scraped-up -- blood here and 
               there. he moves past her into --

               the bathroom

               his hands shaking as he tries to wash them. he bags it.

               the room

               bourne comes out. and there's a long silence until --

                                     marie
                         it doesn't matter who you were before. 
                         it's who you want to be. that's all 
                         that matters.
                              (is he listening?)
                         we have this money. we have what we 
                         have. i had nothing before and now, 
                         i don't know, maybe i have more, 
                         maybe it's nothing, but...
                              (he looks over)
                         i say we leave here. we leave this 
                         place. we go until we can't go 
                         anymore.

                                     bourne
                         you could do that?

                                     marie
                         yes. that's who i want to be.

               bourne nods. turns off the light. takes her hand. and they 
               lay in bed. just laying there.
