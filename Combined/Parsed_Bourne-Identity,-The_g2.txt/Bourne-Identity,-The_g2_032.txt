               ext. streets of zurich -- day -- various shots

               bourne exits the bank. the red bag full to its limit. he's 
               walking briskly now. looking for a taxi. nothing in sight.

               bourne crossing the street. shit, there's a cop on the corner -- 
               turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --

               bourne around a corner. and it's looking good for a moment -- 
               but only a moment -- two more cops walking a beat -- walking 
               this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --

               bourne heading down a boulevard. trying to look small. pulse 
               starting to race. fighting the paranoia. where the hell is a 
               cab? turning back fast as a siren starts bleeding in from 
               behind him --

               it's just an ambulance.

               bourne turning back. forcing himself to focus. and fuck -- 
               there's a meter maid, and she's stopped writing up a ticket -- 
               she's staring at him and --

               bourne trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay 
               small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

               the meter maid -- she's watching him go and she's pulling 
               her radio and --

               bourne hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing 
               himself not to run -- glancing back and --

               there's another cop -- but this one is jogging -- searching -- 
               he's got his radio out and --

               finally to --

               bourne bailing on the street -- disappearing into --
