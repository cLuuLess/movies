                         the treadstone project has actually 
                         already been terminated. it was 
                         designed primarily as a sort of 
                         advanced game program...

               abbott in the hot seat. zorn right there beside him.

                         ...we'd hoped it might build into a 
                         good training platform, but quite 
                         honestly, for a strictly theoretical 
                         exercise, we thought it was far too 
                         expensive. the cost-benefit ratio 
                         was just too high. it's been all but 
                         decommissioned at this point.

                                     marshall
                         all right, what's next?

               zorn handing abbott the next hundred pages.

                         okay, this is blackbriar. blackbriar 
                         is a joint, dod, communications 
                         program that we really feel has good 
                         traction to it.

               abbott is just gonna go on and on and on.
