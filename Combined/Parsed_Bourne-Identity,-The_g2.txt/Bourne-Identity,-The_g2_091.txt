               a secret studio buried deep in the langley facility. equipment 
               up the ass. five people in this darkened room: an engineer 
               working the board. conklin looking sour. zorn in the shadows. 
               abbott sitting there waiting for analysis from --

               mrs. doyle. she's late sixties. a long-time spy shrink. an 
               eminence. a diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence.

                                     bourne/tape
                         "kane. john michael kane."

                         "one moment, sir."

               mrs. doyle nods to the engineer. she's heard enough.

                                     mrs. doyle
                         he's not lying. he's very highly 
                         stressed, but he's not lying. he's 
                         confused. he's aggressively searching 
                         for a way out of the chaos. this 
                         conversation, the video from the 
                         consulate -- the body language, vocal 
                         pattern -- it's my sense he's really 
                         lost here.
                              (beat)
                         i think he snapped.

                                     conklin
                         is that a medical term?

               she turns. battle lines drawn.

                                     mrs. doyle
                         you want clinical terminology? it's 
                         called, "conversation hysteria."
                              (to abbott now --)
                         i don't know exactly how you train 
                         these people. i'm not sure i want to 
                         know. i'll take a guess there's some 
                         extremely rigorous behavior 
                         modification going on here.

               silence. the idea dangling for a moment.

                                     abbott
                         let's assume that's true.

                                     mrs. doyle
                         you can only wind people so tight. 
                         even machines break down.

                                     conklin
                         this unit has an unblemished record 
                         of success.

                                     mrs. doyle
                         then i guess i'm in the wrong meeting.
