               ext. martha's vineyard -- day

               gorgeous summer day. a scooter rental shack near the beach.

               six months later

               marie coming out of the shack with two helmets. handing them 
               to a happy couple waiting there on their scooters.

               the happy couple rides off.

               marie turns back and --

               there's bourne. a new look. a smile.

                                     marie
