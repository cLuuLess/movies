               ext. belleville -- commercial street -- day

               the first thing we notice is noise. the street is burgeoning 
               with life. the second thing we notice are sirens. police 
               cars approaching. bourne and marie head down the street, 
               blending in.

               up ahead -- two police cars snaking through traffic. bourne 
               steers them off this crowded street.
