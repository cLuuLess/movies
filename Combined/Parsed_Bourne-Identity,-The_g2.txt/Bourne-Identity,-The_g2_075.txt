               int. treadstone research desk -- day

               bourne's face -- a video image frozen on a computer screen -- 
               it's bourne looking at the camera -- bourne looking up at 
               the camera in the consulate passport office and --

               pull back to reveal

               half a dozen computer monitors -- and lots of shots of bourne -- 
               twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid 
               perspectives of bourne and his mad scramble through the 
               consulate --

               conklin and research tech #1 poring over these surveillance 
               tapes downloaded from zurich --

                                     conklin
                         and that's the best angle of the 
                         courtyard?

                         that's the only angle.

                                     conklin
                         what do they have on the streets? 
                         the area. they must have something.

                              (typing away --)

               conklin rubbing at the tension in his temples as zorn enters --

                                     conklin
                         what?

                                     zorn
                         abbott. he knows about the embassy. 
                         he's coming down for a show and tell.

                                     conklin
                         that'll solve all our problems.

                              (he's hit paydirt)
                         sir...

                                     conklin
                              (turning back --)
                         what's that?

                                     research tech #1
                         it's an angle of the street -- some 
                         sort of alleyway -- you can just...

                                     conklin
                         enhance it.

               insert -- the monitor -- as the image enlarges to fill the 
               screen. and there's bourne. and the little red car. and marie.

                                     conklin (o.s.)
                         who the hell is that?
