               ext. street/alley near the platform -- day

               two minutes later. bourne and marie -- exhausted -- beat -- 
               everything all at once --

                                     bourne
                         take this.

               she turns. he's holding the locker key.

                                     bourne
                         take it.

               but she doesn't move.

                                     marie
                         and that's it?

                                     bourne
                         if you're lucky.
                              (it's hanging there)
                         take it.
                              (beat)
                         there's enough in there to make a 
                         life. any life. just get out now. 
                         get low. stay low.
                              (beat)
                         take it.

               she takes it. staring at him. simply refusing to cry.

                                     marie
                         what was i thinking, right?

                                     bourne
                         i can't protect you anymore.

                                     marie
                         what about you?

                                     bourne
                         i'm gonna find the end of this.
                              (beat)
                         i can't protect you.

               marie takes one last look. and she's running --

               bourne hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and 
               then he pulls out the e-phone pager. and it's pulsing like 
               crazy.

               bourne flips open the shell. there's a keypad in there.

               holding it. like a missing organ.
