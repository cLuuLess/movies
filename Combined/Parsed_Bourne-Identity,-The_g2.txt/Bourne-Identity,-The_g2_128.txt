               int. hotel de la paix -- lobby -- day

               marie dropping off the key. hope hangs in the air --

                                     clerk
                         xxxxxx...

                                     marie
                         xxxxxx

               bourne enters. he's got the black duffel. car keys.

                                     bourne
                         xxxxxx.

                                     marie
                         xxxxxx

               and now they're headed for the door. something doesn't feel 
               right for bourne -- and then he notices --

                                     bourne
                         stop where you are.

                                     marie
                         what?

               bourne turns back to the clerk.

                                     bourne
                         where's the dog?

                                     clerk
                         my husband's out looking for him.

                                     bourne
                         he run away often?

                                     clerk
                         that old beast? miss his breakfast? 
                         not a chance.
                              (returning to cleaning)
                         it's always something, right?

               suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different --

                                     bourne
                         get in the basement.

                                     clerk
                         what?

                                     bourne
                              (to marie)
                         get everyone down in the basement.

               now marie doesn't need a second warning --

                                     clerk
                         what the hell're you talking about?

                                     bourne
                         you're in danger. all of you. i have 
                         no time to explain.

                                     clerk
                         wait a minute --

                                     bourne
                         i'm sorry.

               -- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her 
               purse, clearing out of the room. slamming the door behind 
               her -- click -- it's locked.

                                     marie
                         jason...

               no answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk, 
               coming up with -- a shot gun, an old one, but nonetheless a 
               gun --

                                     marie
                         who is it? who's out there?

               and now bourne is moving, pulling open a drawer.  a box of 
               shells. filling his pockets.

                                     bourne
                         xxxxxx

                                     marie
                         xxxxxx

                                     bourne
                         i won't let that happen.

               and he is moving down the small hallway.  away from the front 
               door -- towards the back door under the stairs.
