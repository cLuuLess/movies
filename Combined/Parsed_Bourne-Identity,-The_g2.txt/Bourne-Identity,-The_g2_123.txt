               int. wombosi's compound hallway -- night

               bourne being marched toward the throne room doors -- deauvage 
               and bodyguard #1 flanking him -- kids and wives staring as 
               he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to 
               the gallows --

               the big doors thrown open wide and --

               wombosi on the throne.

                                     wombosi
                         come in.
                              (an imperial gesture)
                         please...

               bourne steps up to the plate.

                                     wombosi
                         did you bring investment advice for 
                         me tonight? it was tax shelters, 
                         wasn't it? swiss debenture-swaps.

                                     bourne
                         mpg capital.

                                     wombosi
                         i think investment advice from a 
                         dead man, it's a bad idea.
                              (beat)
                         how does it feel to be dead?

                                     bourne
                         it's a lot more stressful than i 
                         thought.

               kids have started sneaking into the room -- deauvage is trying 
               to scoot them out but --

                                     wombosi
                         -- no -- no, let them in! -- let 
                         them in.
                              (to the kids)
                         come in -- on y va -- come in...
                              (to bourne)
                         i think everyone wants to see the 
                         dead man.

               bourne watching the kids -- they are all staring --

                                     wombosi
                         what do you do?
                              (on his feet now --)
                         you get an appointment with me? you 
                         make sure it's on the boat? you come 
                         visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit 
                         investment package. you drink my 
                         water -- eat my bread -- play with 
                         my children -- and what? -- two nights 
                         later you come back and you put this 
                         death --
                              (slamming something 
                              down onto the throne --)
                         -- you put this in my engine room!

               there is a bomb on the throne now.

                                     wombosi
                         so this is a different kind of 
                         meeting.
                              (steam building)
                         maybe now we talk some truth, okay? 
                         one dead man to another.

               bourne -- caught off guard as -- wombosi suddenly rips away 
               his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the 
               shirt --

               bourne's back -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --

                                     wombosi
                         you see this?
                              (calling to deauvage --)
                         i told you my shot was better!

                                     deauvage
                         he went in the water -- how did he 
                         live?

                                     wombosi
                         no, no no...
                              (and he means this --)
                         this is a strong killer. this is a 
                         crazy strong killer. oh, yeah...
                              (circling)
                         to make a killer that looks like 
                         you? this young? this face?
                              (he means this)
                         it's bloody fucking amazing.

               bourne imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him -- 
               the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --

                                     bourne
                         who do you think sent me?

                                     wombosi
                         i know who sent you. i don't know 
                         why.
                              (this could get 
                              physical at any moment 
                              now --)
                         i learned many, many things from the 
                         cia. many things. i learned the way 
                         they think.
                              (beat)
                         was the bomb on my boat supposed to 
                         go off or not?

               bourne distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...

                                     wombosi
                         you didn't set the bomb. why?

               bourne not sure -- about any of it --

                                     wombosi
                         was this a game or a fuck up?

                                     bourne
                         i don't know.

                                     wombosi
                         get the kids out!

               he doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill -- 
               they're gone.

                                     wombosi
                         and the door.

               deauvage closing the doors and as he does --

               the professor attacks...

                   ...................................................

               this scene has not been written

               it's a shootout.

               the professor is infinitely more talented at this than the 
               bodyguards.

               bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

               no children are harmed.

               as the professor rallies -- he will shoot wombosi -- he will 
               find bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he 
               will find a clue leading him to belleville) and last but 
               hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still 
               sitting there on the throne.

               there will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

               this might not want to be very long. there is an extensive 
               action sequence just around the corner.

               so bourne escapes. physically he's just weary. emotionally 
               he's fucked.

               all of that happens and we cut to --

                   ...................................................
