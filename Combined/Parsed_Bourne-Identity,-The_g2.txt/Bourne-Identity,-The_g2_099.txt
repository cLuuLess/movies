               int. an empty office suite -- day

               vacancy wasteland. dead phone lines hanging. carpet pulled 
               up. completely stripped out. bourne and marie standing there 
               staring.

                                     marie
                         this can't be it.

               she turns around -- and what's he doing? -- bourne with a 
               piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful 
               and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking 
               the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a 
               rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the 
               glass door --

               and as he's doing this, we're hearing --

                                     telephone voice (over)
                              (british, female)
                         destin navigational, can i help you?

                                     bourne's voice (over)
                         hey, how are you. i'm trying to reach 
                         richard? is he there.

               we're watching the mpg logo emerge and seeing bourne and 
               marie react, as we hear --

                                     telephone voice
                         i'm afraid there's no richard here.
                              (continuing into --)
