               apfel emerges from the bank. leaving work. turns the corner 
               into a quiet side street and --

               up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. it's manheim 
               walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. barely 
               noticing apfel as they get closer and --

               as they pass -- manheim -- it's completely out of the blue -- 
               he's jabbing the cellphone down into apfel's shoulder and --

               apfel -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary 
               exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street 
               and --

               manheim -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and 
               as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

               insert -- the cellphone -- manheim's hands working to retract 
               a syringe into the device and --

               manheim striding away. disappearing into zurich...
