               int. cdg airport -- night

               the professor arriving in paris.  coming through the terminal 
               as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --

               hotel sequence -- sketched only

               hotel marboeuf paris. this is the place that answered the 
               phone when bourne hit redial in his apartment. this is the 
               place that john michael kane was staying when he "died."

               and so begins, the investigation...

               now, since the presence of danger -- ie wombosi's guys and/or 
               treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene 
               could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're 
               not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene 
               is not finished.

               the rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: bourne 
               would have to be very nervous about being recognized. if he 
               was kane and kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever 
               "social engineering" needs doing.

               long version? bourne sets the table and marie gets the goods. 
               somehow there's a threat from treadstone or wombosi.

               fast version? it's all results -- we see them execute a plan 
               rather than work it up. marie is already in the hotel. in a 
               hotel uniform? posing as a guest? in any case, she looks 
               very much different than we've ever seen her before.

               she gets close to the office. hides. waits. bourne calls the 
               desk from a pay phone. asks for something. we see that some 
               sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel 
               to start a fire. in the confusion -- marie -- very bravely -- 
               gets into the office. we do a quick cut outside to bourne 
               waiting and --
