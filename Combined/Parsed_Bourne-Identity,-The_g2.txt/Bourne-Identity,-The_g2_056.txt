               bourne still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's 
               no choice -- he has to go down --

               bourne finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching 
               down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --

               bourne hesitates. does he know how to do this or not? stalled 
               for a moment, then...

               bourne starts climbing down. and this is all one shot. no 
               cutaway. no cheating.

               we are watching a master at work...

               handhold to a drain pipe. swinging to a better ledge.

               dropping to an air-conditioner. grabbing a window frame just 
               before the air-conditioner gives way. teetering there. now 
               he's on the fourth floor.

               below, there's an open window on the third floor. struggling 
               to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight 
               of the bag, and as he does --

               the red bag falls. thump. into the courtyard. forget the 
               open window. now he's got to go all the way.

               timing his next move and --

               he's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe 
               and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting 
               to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent -- 
               the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --

               bourne letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one 
               last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough 
               to slow his fall and --

               letting go for the last fifteen feet and --
