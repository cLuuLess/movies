               ext. pool deck - close angle on gene - 12:41pm

               gene blinks in the sudden, bright sunshine. when his eyes 
               adjust, he finds himself in a line that is approaching a 
               security man with a hand-held metal detector. he panics, 
               turns, trying to escape, but finds himself bumped along, 
               trapped. the line shuffles forward. he turns, determined to 
               make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a 
               2nd security man, who waves him to one side.

               2nd security man excuse me, sir, you don't have to wait. i 
               can take you over here.

               gene is dragged forward. he looks around; no way out. he 
               stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of 
               his body, is lifted over to the other. down it slides, toward 
               the pocket concealing the gun. gene waits for the alarm -
               which doesn't come. the security man operating the gizmo 
               deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. gene is pushed 
               on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among:

               press by the dozens. eleanor samara grant supporters by the 
               hundreds. security men and cops in uniform. gene moves through 
               them, trying to figure out what just happened. he glances 
               back to the 2nd security man, and bumps into one particular 
               police officer, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts 
               with a quick laugh.

               police officer easy, sir. got to watch where you're going in 
               a crowd like this.

               he is a handsome, solid-looking guy. you'd trust him. call 
               him officer trust. officer trust seems to be in charge. he 
               moves off through the crowd, giving local police orders in 
               an easy way.

               gene looks around. he can't see mr. smith. he edges his way 
               after officer trust, who reaches the wall beyond which is 
               the drop to the street. he leans there comfortably, scanning 
               the crowd, gene reaches the wall a few yards away from him. 
               he looks out at the city, getting his courage up. just as he 
               turns to approach officer trust:


                                     mr. smith (o.s.)
                         i know what you're thinking.

               gene freezes! mr. smith appears from the crowd, joins him. 
               he smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it.

                                     gene
                         what would you do in my place?

                                     mr. smith
                         me?

               he flips the walkie-talkie, catches it.

                                     mr. smith
                         the bitch would be dead. course i 
                         ain't sayin' which bitch.

               he flips the walkie-talkie. gene lashes out, smacks the walkie-
               talkie. it sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the 
               sidewalk four stories below.

               mr. smith goes ballistic.

               gene walks away from him - right up to officer trust.

                                     gene
                         there's a plot to kill the governor. 
                         if you don't believe me, check that 
                         guy right there. he has a gun.

               officer trust looks at mr. smith and then at gene.

                                     officer trust
                         so do you, mr. watson.

               and officer trust reaches in his hip pocket for a spare walkie-
               talkie that he tosses to mr. smith.

                                     officer trust
                         you got this under control?

                                     mr. smith
                         yeah.

                                     officer trust
                         it doesn't look like it.


                                     mr. smith
                         it's under control.

                                     officer trust
                         it better be.

               officer trust walks away.

               mr. smith stares at a devastated gene. he sticks the walkie-
               talkie into his pocket, grabs gene under the arm, drags him 
               to an isolated corner.

                                     mr. smith
                         i oughta throw you after that walkie-
                         talkie but i'm going to give you a 
                         break because you're an amateur.

                                     waiter m (o.s.)
                         gentlemen...

               the waiter offers a tray of hors d'houvres.

                                     mr. smith
                         yeah, thanks. have a cracker.

               gene shakes his head.

                                     mr. smith
                         have a cracker, mr. watson.

               gene woodenly takes one. the waiter moves on.

                                     mr. smith
                         there was this guy. big guy. irish-
                         italian. red-faced, black-haired, 
                         jolly son-of-a-bitch.

               we see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting.

                                     mr. smith
                         nobody could make me laugh like him. 
                         we closed more bars together than i 
                         can count. he was my pal. i loved 
                         that crazy mick, i'm not ashamed to 
                         say it. but he was fuck-up. he had 
                         this image of himself. thought he 
                         was con man. always trying to shave 
                         the edge. nickel and dime. i'll always 
                         miss him. tell me why.


                                     gene
                         what...?

                                     mr. smith
                         tell me why i miss him.

                                     gene
                         he's dead?

                                     mr. smith
                         that's right. he's dead. tell me 
                         why.

                                     gene
                         how should i...?

                                     mr. smith
                         tell me why he's dead.

               gene stares at him for a beat.

                                     gene
                         you killed him.

                                     mr. smith
                         that's right, i killed him. he fucked 
                         up one too many times so i put a 
                         bullet in his eye. then i put two 
                         more into him just to make sure. now 
                         that was somebody i loved.

               he moves in on gene, crowding him. he breathes hard, looks 
               like one insane piece of work.

                                     mr. smith
                         i loved that motherfucker but i got 
                         the call and i put him down like a 
                         sick animal. so if you've got any 
                         doubts about what's going to happen 
                         if you don't deliver let me tell you 
                         something. i'd make gravy out of 
                         your little girl just to season that 
                         black irish cocksucker's meat.

               a wave of applause catches their attention.


               angle on eleanor grant

               she and her entourage enter the pool deck and walk toward 
               the platform. eleanor grant gladhands people on the way.

               angle on mr. smith - 12:45pm

               he turns' back to gene.

                                     mr. smith
                         do what you're supposed to do. do it 
                         now.

               he grabs gene and gives him a push. there is a general 
               movement in the crowd toward the platform. gene is buffeted 
               along. mr. smith follows him, keeping him in sight, but then 
               a pack of photographers move in, start snapping, lifting 
               their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. mr. smith 
               instinctively turns away, hiding his face. he moves around 
               the photogs and finds himself separated from gene by the 
               mob. he searches, trying to spot him.

                                     mr. smith
                         shit!

               angle on gene - 12:4 6pm

               in the crowd, gene is bumped this way and that. his face 
               displays an inner devastation. his eyes focus desperately on 
               something ahead:

               it is the back of eleanor grant's head. she is turning this 
               way and that, greeting supporters.

               gene's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. he is at 
               the end of his rope. he is going to do it.

               angle on rostrum

               a local politico mounts the platform, taps the microphone.

               local politico can i have your attention please! please 
               welcome a man who was for 19 years the distinguished mayor 
               of los angeles.  the honorable tom bradley.

               the crowd reacts loudly, yells and whistles. gene-pushes his 
               way forward.


                                     tom bradley
                         it is my extreme pleasure this 
                         afternoon to introduce to you...

               angle on gene - 12:4 6pm

               he is now a few yards from eleanor grant. he comes up against 
               the security man who gave him the once-over with the metal 
               detector. the man's eyes slide over him, then he looks away. 
               he nonchalantly steps aside, moves off through the crowd.

                                     tom bradley
                         ...a woman who can only be 
                         characterized as a one-of-a-kind.

               gene is close to eleanor grant. she is just a few bodies 
               away, visible between them. his hand moves in his pocket. he 
               swallows. the impulse sweeps over him and...

                                     krista (o.s.)
                         feeling better?

               krista brooks, the young woman from the elevator is next to 
               him, smiling. he looks at her in confusion.

                                     tom bradley
                         an iconoclast with class...

                                     krista
                         the elevator. you weren't feeling 
                         well.

               gene looks at eleanor grant.

                                     tom bradley
                         a genuine lady who's not afraid to 
                         get into the trenches...

                                     krista
                         are you better now?

               gene turns, scans the crowd - no sign of mr. smith.

                                     tom bradley
                         ...and go to the mat with greedy 
                         special interests...

               gene looks at krista, studies her intensely. she's a bit 
               unnerved.


                                     tom bradley
                         the finest governor our state has 
                         ever had...

               again gene looks at eleanor grant. she's turning around, 
               facing the crowd, facing him.

                                     tom bradley
                         my friend and yours, governor eleanor 
                         grant!

               eleanor grant raises her arms. a perfect target. the crowd 
               roars as gene turns back to krista. he leans into her, speaks.

                                     gene
                         my wife always said i had a problem 
                         trusting people.

                                     krista
                         well, you can trust eleanor samara 
                         grant.

                                     gene
                         you don't understand. i'm going to 
                         trust you. and you have to trust me.

               krista looks at gene.

                                     krista
                         yes, you're right, i don't understand.

                                     gene
                         look...my daughter ... she's going 
                         to die...unless you can help me.

               krista assesses gene, his desperate tone of voice. obviously 
               a nut case. a well-dressed nut case, but a nut case 
               nevertheless. krista, nervous, looks around for help.

                                     krista
                         sure, sure, i'll help you. let me 
                         get mr. white. i'm sure he can assist 
                         you, he's our...

               gene pulls the gun, holding it in krista's sight only, 
               unnoticed by anyone else.


                                     gene
                              (sotto voce)
                         no! you have to listen to me.

               krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at gene.

                                     krista
                         i'm listening, i'm listening.

               angle on the rostrum

               eleanor grant takes over the microphone from the beaming 
               local politico.

                                     eleanor grant
                         my friends, my good friends...

               angle on the crowd

               gene and krista are gone.
