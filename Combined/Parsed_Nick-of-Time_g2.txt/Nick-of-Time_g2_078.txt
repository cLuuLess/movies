               huey and gene move down a drab service corridor. boxes stacked 
               on both sides, floor buffers at rest, shelves with cleaning 
               supplies. gene notices for the first time that huey has a 
               pronounced limp.

               they come upon irene the cleaning woman. she joins them moving 
               down the corridor.

                                     huey
                         meet irene.

               irene takes gene's hand and leads him along at a half-trot.
