               ext. union station - parking lot - bus stop - day - 12:19pm

               ...a large crowd of tourists, that have just exited an 
               arriving mini-bus. gene is caught up in the crowd and carried 
               along like a leaf in a stream.

               amid the chattering crowd, gene is pushed along as if in a 
               trance. he touches the pocket with the gun. he looks at the


               bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. it's 
               like a splash of cold water. he quickly pockets the bullets, 
               turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. they resist 
               him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see...

               the van is gone!

               angle on gene -- 12:19pm

               he stands there, a lost man. fear sweeps over him. he looks 
               desperately around. he is within himself, oblivious to his 
               surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. 
               he is a man alone in a crowd. he takes a step.

               a little latino girl, chased by her brother, runs into gene's 
               legs. he instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds 
               himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. his heart 
               plunges - she isn't lynn. his intensity scares her.

                                     little girl
                         mama!

               she pulls away, flees to her mother, who hoists her up, 
               reprimanding her in spanish. gene stays crouched, watching 
               the little girl staring at him over her mother's shoulder.

               until a cop crosses his line of sight. a los angeles transit 
               policeman, foot-patrolling the station.

               it's like a gift from above. relief floods gene's face. he 
               is saved. he stands, hurries toward the cop, each step more 
               confident.

               then, just beyond the cop, mr. smith casually slides into 
               view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. gene walks right 
               past the cop heading towards a cab stand. mr. smith falls in 
               behind him speaking in his ear.

                                     mr. smith
                         you talk to a cop, you even look at 
                         a cop too long and your daughter is 
                         dead.
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         do it.

                         go ahead, sugar die.


                                     lynn (v.o.)
                              (filtered)
                         lynn calling daddy. lynn calling 
                         daddy. come in, daddy.

               gene grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man.

                                     gene
                         lynn!

                                     lynn (v.o.)

                         i can hear you good. can you hear 
                         me?

                                     gene
                         yes. yes, i can hear you.

                                     mr. smith
                         that's enough.

                                     ms. jones (v.o.)

                              (filtered)
                         he has to say "over and out". daddy, 
                         you have to say "over and out".

                                     gene
                         over and out.

               mr. smith clicks off the walkie-talkie.

                                     mr. smith
                         look at your watch. look at it! at 
                         one-thirty your little girl is dead. 
                         say it with me. at one-thirty my 
                         little girl is dead. say it. say it!

                                     gene
                              (softly)
                         at one thirty my little girl is dead.

                                     mr. smith
                         unless you do what you're told. go 
                         do it!


               he pushes gene on, toward a cab.

                                     mr. smith
                         and don't forget i'll be watching 
                         you.

               gene looks back at him, full of impotent rage. mr. smith 
               raises the walkie-talkie. gene reaches the first cab at the 
               stand.
