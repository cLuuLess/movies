               ext. flower street - day - 12:3 6pm

               gene comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving 
               through the traffic.

               once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping 
               low, sneaking up behind it. he crouches by the front door, 
               one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on 
               the door handle. he raises his head cautiously and looks 
               inside the cab.

               no ms. jones up front at least. he takes a breath, braces 
               himself. with one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks 
               out the gun.
