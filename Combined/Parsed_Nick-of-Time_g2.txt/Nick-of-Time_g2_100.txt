               int. room 2510 - day - 1:25pm

               other lights have been turned on. eleanor grant is fixing 
               her hair in the mirror. franco is cleaning up the broken 
               lamp. there is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it 
               opens, revealing brendan grant. the mystery man hovers in 
               the background.

                                     brendan grant
                         hey, el, how's the head?

               she turns, locks eyes with the mystery man.

                                     mystery man
                         eleanor.

               she nods, turns back to the mirror.

                                     eleanor grant
                         lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm 
                         thinking of canceling the speech.

                                     brendan grant
                         it's an important speech.

                                     mystery man
                         i'd say critical, not that it's any 
                         of my business.

                                     eleanor grant
                         it's just another speech in a tower 
                         of babel so high that nimrod himself 
                         would be put to shame. cancel. make 
                         my apologies.

               in the mirror she takes note of brendan grant and the mystery 
               man exchange a look.
 

                                     brendan grant
                         excuse me.

                                     mystery man
                         i'll trot along. nice to see you, 
                         eleanor.

               brendan steps into the room, shuts the door.

                                     brendan grant
                         during a campaign every speech is 
                         important. this is free media 
                         exposure. primetime news coverage 
                         that we couldn't buy.

                                     eleanor grant
                         what's he doing here?

                                     brendan grant
                         who, him? just visiting.

                                     eleanor grant t
                         hings have changed, brendan. i thought 
                         you understood that.

                                     brendan grant
                         he's my friend. and he did help you 
                         to get elected, after all.

                                     eleanor grant
                         don't remind me.

                                     brendan grant
                              (re the broken lamp)
                         what happened here?

                                     eleanor grant
                         nothing. i broke a lamp.

               brendan steps behind eleanor and puts his arms around her 
               affectionately.

                                     brendan grant
                         eleanor, please. i'll put it this 
                         way. this speech or a half-dozen 
                         rubber chicken-fund raisers. what do 
                         you say?


                                     eleanor grant
                         truth is, besides the headache i've 
                         come down with a little lower 
                         intestinal havoc. make my apologies.

                                     brendan grant
                         come on, el, you're a trooper. i'll 
                         get you some pepto, you'll make one 
                         of your patented tributes to the 
                         common person, then back to 
                         sacramento. this is no time to lay 
                         down on the job. i don't care what 
                         the polls say, you can't afford to 
                         relax. look what happened to bush. 
                         tell you what, if you want to blow 
                         off the sacramento speech, fine. but 
                         do this one and we'll get out of the 
                         smog.

               eleanor grant looks at him, almost sadly. she steps toward 
               the dressing table to fix her hair

                                     eleanor grant
                         all right, i'll do it.

                                     brendan grant
                         that's my girl.

                                     eleanor grant
                         but i want to make some changes. get 
                         krista in here right away won't you?

               brendan looks at her for a beat, then snaps his fingers like 
               he just remembered something.

                                     brendan grant
                         aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.

                                     eleanor grant
                         you sent my assistant on an errand.

                                     brendan grant
                              (trying to look 
                              sheepish)
                         i've been a bad boy.

               angle on eleanor

               it was not what she wanted to hear.
