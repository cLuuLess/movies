                                     eleanor grant
                         whose idea was it to have a lunch 
                         right after the brunch? i'm about to 
                         bust as it is.
 

                                     krista
                         we'll just walk through, do a little 
                         grip-and-grin, then get ready for 
                         the press con.

               insert floor indicator

               we are on the third floor.

               the doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise.

                                     gene
                         governor...

               it comes out a little louder then he intended. he has turned, 
               his back to the door. everyone looks at him. he's committed.

                                     gene
                         i need your help.

                                     eleanor grant
                         what can i do for you mr....watson?

                                     gene
                         its'...ah...about my daughter....

               the elevator slows and stops on the next floor above.

               insert floor indicator

               we are on the fourth floor.

               behind gene, the doors open.

                                     mr. smith (o.s.)
                         room for one more?

               gene freezes.

                                     eleanor grant
                         i think we can accommodate you.

               she offers her hand to mr. smith as he steps on board.

                                     eleanor grant
                         eleanor grant, gubernatorial 
                         incumbent.
 

                                     mr. smith
                         a pleasure to meet you, governor.

               the car begins to rise again. eleanor .grant turns back to 
               gene.

                                     eleanor grant
                         you were saying?  your daughter....?

                                     gene
                         i...

                                     eleanor grant
                         yes?

               angle on mr smith

               yes???

               angle on gene

               what to do now?

                                     gene
                         she ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure 
                         to get your autograph.

                                     eleanor grant
                         of course.  i wish everything were 
                         that easy.

                                     krista
                         i've got the pen if you've got the 
                         paper.

               gene looks at her. she smiles back.

                                     krista
                         how about that?

               he looks at what she refers to: the manila envelope he holds, 
               the one mr. smith gave him.

                                     krista
                         is that something precious?

                                     gene
                         no, that's,..that's fine
 

               he gives it to eleanor grant. krista hands over the pen. 
               gene's eyes flick over to mr. smith who is staring at the 
               envelope.

                                     eleanor grant
                         what's her name?

               gene looks at the governor, only inches away, back to mr. 
               smith, who raises his eyes, nods, his silent message curt -
               do it! gene pulls his eyes away.

                                     gene
                         her name? her name is lynn.

               eleanor grant writes the autograph. mr. smith's eyes drill 
               into him. gene looks over. mr. smith raises a hand to his 
               face, pretends to scratch an itch. his other hand taps his 
               wristwatch. gene's hand slides toward his jacket pocket.  
               sweat beads on his forehead. he's barely aware of krista 
               talking to him.

                                     krista
                         it's funny. i don't even keep a pad 
                         of paper with me anymore, everything's 
                         gone so electronic.

               he gives her a quick, weak smile. his free hand wipes the 
               sweat from his face.

                                     krista
                         if it wasn't for double a batteries 
                         i'd be in big trouble.

               he is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun, but stops 
               when he notices mr. smith's hand slide into his jacket, where 
               his gun is.

               he looks at the other mr. smith, earphone, crewcut-security. 
               there is the hint of a gun on his hip.

               gene's eyes widen, dart to mr. smith's face, his hand sliding 
               into his coat. his hand hovers over his gun, trembling. is 
               the security man staring at him?

               eleanor grant hands over the autograph.
 

                                     eleanor grant
                         are you all right? elevators make me 
                         queasy, too.

               gene gives her a sick smile, abruptly turns away. he takes 
               his hand out of his pocket. it's shaking. he clenches it to 
               stop the shakes.

               the doors open, startling him.
