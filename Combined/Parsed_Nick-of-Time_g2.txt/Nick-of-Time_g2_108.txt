               the dais. franco takes a shuddering breath. eleanor grant 
               pulls herself free, leans over him. she rips opens his shirt 
               revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet 
               hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. his eyes 
               flutter open.

                                     eleanor grant
                         are you all right, franco?

                                     franco
                              (painfully)
                         i'd be better if they'd put sleeves 
                         on these damn vests.

               she touches his face, looks over to where her husband stands. 
               their eyes lock. it's curtains for brendan.
