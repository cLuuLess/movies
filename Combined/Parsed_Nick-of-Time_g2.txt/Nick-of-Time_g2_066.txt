               int. bonaventure hotel - shoeshine stand - day - 1:02pm

               gene walks over, climbs into a chair.

                                     huey
                              (still not looking up)
                         take ten, take a break, take a seat, 
                         take a load off. put the world in 
                         perspective.

               gene has settled into the chair. huey tosses the magazine 
               aside, swings into action...

                                     huey
                         so, are you a visitor or are you 
                         lucky enough to...
 

               ...and freezes, staring at the familiar pair of shoes.

                                     huey
                              (as he looks up)
                         you got a complaint?

               gene looks down at him.

                                     gene
                         you remember me?

                                     huey
                         i remember. the big tipper.

                                     gene
                         something is going to happen. when 
                         it's over you'll know what i was 
                         talking about.

                                     huey
                         oh, man...

                                     gene
                         please. something is going to 
                         happen...

                                     huey
                         what? the end of the world? man, 
                         don't give me your mad rap. i'm not 
                         a bartender. i don't want to hear 
                         it. i raise a family doing this 
                         bullshit. do me a favor. get your 
                         crazy white ass out of my chair.

                                     gene
                         please...

                                     huey
                         hey, a big tip doesn't give you the 
                         right to crap in my ear. you want 
                         change?  you got it, brother. what 
                         was that you gave me, a twenty?

               huey kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. 
               from behind him:

                                     mr. smith
                         come on, let's get some privacy.


                                     gene
                         he's deaf.

               it spills out of gene almost without volition. there's a 
               note of pleading hidden in it. gene slowly points a thumb at 
               huey's "disabled veteran" sign.

                                     gene
                         he can't hear a word we're saying.

               mr. smith looks at the sign. huey stops what he's doing -
               "what the fuck?" he almost says it aloud, then:

                                     mr. smith
                         you wouldn't be kidding me now, would 
                         you, mr. watson?
                              (to huey's back)
                         hey, nigger! is that right? you can't 
                         hear me? nigger?

               huey's face settles into something cold. what's he going to 
               do?  he stands, looks at gene, who stares back at him, then 
               slowly turns around, looks at mr. smith - and breaks into a 
               jive-ass grin.

                                     huey
                         why, looky-here. my customer-quotient 
                         just got multiplied by two. what do 
                         you think of that?  you'll have to 
                         forgive me, sir. didn't hear your 
                         approach. fact of the matter is, i'm 
                         deef as a post. compliments of the 
                         united states army...
                              (does a snappy salute)
                         ...artillery corps. can i give you a 
                         shine, sir? you don't see your face, 
                         you don't pay.

               mr. smith is suspicious but he climbs into the second chair.

                                     mr. smith
                              (loudly)
                         yeah, sure, give me a shine...
                              (looks at gene)
                         ...shine.

               huey goes to work on his shoes.
 

                                     mr. smith
                         i'm putting your toy back in your 
                         pocket, mr. watson.

               unseen by mr. smith, huey takes a peek and sees the gun being 
               transferred to gene's pocket.

                                     mr. smith
                         it's all wound up. now let's get out 
                         your itinerary.

               gene does.

               "1:'30 - california leads the nation into the 21st century -
               california ballroom - governor eleanor samara grant and 
               brendan grant" it is the last entry.

                                     gene
                         one thirty. california ballroom.

                                     mr. smith
                              (glances at huey)
                         that's right. that gives you...

               he looks at his watch.

               1:04.

                                     mr. smith
                         ...twenty-six minutes to get your 
                         shit together.

                                     gene
                         let me talk to her again.

                                     mr. smith
                         no. 

                                     gene
                         i want'to talk to her.

                                     mr. smith
                         forget about it.


                                     gene
                         i talk to her or you can forget about 
                         it.

                                     mr. smith
                         don't you threaten me.

                                     gene
                         what are you going to do about it, 
                         shoot me?

                                     mr. smith
                         (glances again at huey) you know 
                         what i'm gonna do.

                                     gene
                         what? walk out there and twist her 
                         arm off?

               mr. smith doesn't reply.

                                     gene
                         it would be a lot less trouble just 
                         to let me talk to her.

               they stare at each other for a few beats. then mr. smith 
               checks huey out and gets out the walkie-talkie.

                                     mr. smith
                              (into it)
                         come back.

                                     mr. smith
                         put her on.

                                     ms. jones (o.s.)
                         what gives? 

                                     mr. smith
                         just put her on.

                         daddy?

               gene grabs the walkie-talkie.

                                     gene
                         yes, sweetie, it's me.
