               gene 'bangs out of a door, comes to a failing and sees:

               mr. smith has reached the spiral stairway. he starts down 
               it, two and three steps at a time.

               gene moves along the railing.

               mr. smith is a whole floor below him. he looks up, sees gene 
               and lifts the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

               gene pockets the gun climbs the parapet. and jumps!
