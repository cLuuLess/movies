               int. service corridor - day - 1:23pm

               the service elevator opens and gene rushes out. he hurries 
               down the dim service corridor. suddenly an arm snakes out of 
               the blackness and grabs him! huey steps into the light.

                                     huey
                         well?

                                     gene
                         i don't know.

                                     huey
                         what are you going to do now?


                                     gene
                         i don't know. i have to get back.

               gene keeps moving fast.  huey limps to keep up

                                     huey
                         what are you going to do!?

                                     gene
                         this is about power and you haven't 
                         got any. there's nothing more you 
                         can do. i'm sorry. thanks for trying.

               huey watches him disappear.
