               ext. taxi stand - day

               ...and stares at gene, soaking wet, holding the gun. mr. 
               smith's gun slides from his hand.

                                     mr. smith
                         very good...mr. watson. i told 
                         them...i could make a killer out of 
                         you.

               he drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face.

               angle on gene

               he rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to 
               pick lynn up.

               angle on ms jones and huey

               she has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from huey 
               to gene. she raises her gun and aims at gene and lynn inside 
               the van.

               huey reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered 
               artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the 
               side of her head. she is knocked aside and out.

                                     huey
                         there's nothing like a good wing-
                         tip.
