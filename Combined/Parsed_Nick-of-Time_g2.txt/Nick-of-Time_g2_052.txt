               int. twenty-fifth floor - security table - day - 12:50pm

               krista leads gene past the security guard stationed in the 
               hallway at a small table. gene tries to keep his face turned 
               away. the guard glances up.

                                     hall guard
                         ms. brooks ...

                                     krista
                         is he in?

                                     hall guard
                         yes, ma'am.

               they walk past him. he's a bit curious about gene, but shrugs 
               it off.

               gene and krista reach a door and knock.

                                     gene
                         who is this? are you sure we can 
                         trust him?

                                     krista
                         i'm sure. it's her husband. he's her 
                         campaign manager.

               the door opens. brendan grant is framed there.

                                     brendan grant
                         what is it? is there a problem?
 

                                     krista
                         we need to see you, brendan.

               she grabs gene and pushes inside.
