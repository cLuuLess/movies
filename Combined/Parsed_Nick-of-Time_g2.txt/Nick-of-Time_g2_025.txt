               int. third floor - shop arcade area - day - 12:27pm

               gene and mr. smith pass gift shops, snack bars. the walkway 
               is crowded and gene is going against the tide of reporters, 
               politicians, supporters, and just a lot of people with name 
               tags.

               gene plows on through...

               ...and runs smack into brendan grant.

                                     brendan grant
                              (laughs)
                         whoops!

               the two men reel back from each other. a security man, 
               earphones and gray suit, steps immediately between them. 
               brendan grant is a charmingly smooth man.

                                     brendan grant
                         nice body check.

               he continues on, talking to an attractive wcman companion.

               brendan grant what the governor really admires, mrs. wentzel, 
               and eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion, 
               are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it 
               into a positive force.


               he slides a familiar hand around her waist.

                                     brendan grant
                         you know my wife has a deeply personal 
                         reason for going after repeat drunk 
                         drivers. they are felons and they 
                         should be treated as such. a drivers 
                         license is a privilege, not a right.

               and he is hustled away. right past an election poster 
               featuring him and governor grant.

               still stunned by the encounter, gene turns back and watches 
               the governor's husband, but keeps walking.
