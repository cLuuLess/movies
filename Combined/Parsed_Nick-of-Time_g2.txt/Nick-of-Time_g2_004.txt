               ext. union station - platform - day - 12:08pm

               the train.. a pretty six-year-old girl (lynn) , who is holding 
               a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the 
               steps. she reaches the platform, looks around. from within 
               the train:

                                     gene
                         lynn!  lynn!!


               gene watson, thirtyish, a regular joe in appearance and 
               inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. 
               he takes a relieved breath when he sees  her.

                                     gene
                         lynn, don't walk ahead of me, ok?

               as he comes down the steps:

                                     gene
                         i'm serious, honey. don't get out of 
                         my sight, all right? i want you to 
                         stay right by me. will you do that 
                         for me?

                                     lynn
                         nods solemnly. gene reaches the 
                         platform and gives out an exaggerated 
                         sigh.

                                     gene
                         we made it.

               lynn nods back.

                                     lynn
                         we made it.
