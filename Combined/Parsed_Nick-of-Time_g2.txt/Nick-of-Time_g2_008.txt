               int. union station - pay phone area - day - 12:10pm

               gene has found a pay phone. he keeps an eye on lynn who has 
               wandered a few yards away.


                                     gene
                         hello, is mr. conners there? i have 
                         an interview with him at twelve-
                         thirty. hi, mr. conners, this is 
                         gene watson. sorry to call you at 
                         the last minute like this but... 
                         hey, hey!

               he reacts to the rollerblading teens who swoop past lynn, 
               one on each side, too close for a father's comfort.

                                     gene
                         watch that! lynn, come here!

               she does. he keeps an eye on the teens, who, having found a 
               victim, are circling around, passing mr. smith and .ms. jones. 
               mr. smith has noticed gene.

               gene at the phone.

                                     gene
                         sorry. there's some crazy kids on 
                         skates. listen, the train just got 
                         in, i'm afraid i'm going to be a few 
                         minutes late.

               the teens make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other 
               objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. mr. smith 
               watches gene watch the teens, then notice a sturdy, sand-
               filled ashtray next to him.

                                     gene
                         great. ok, i'll get there as soon as 
                         i can. bye, now.

               he hangs up. keeping one eye on the circling teens.

                                     gene
                              (to lynn)
                         ready?

                                     lynn
                         nods.

                                     gene
                         let' s do it.

               he picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to 
               knock over the ashtray, just as the teens approach. the 
               ashtray spills its load of sand into their path. when they 
               hit it, their skates stop, they don't. they sprawl, doing 
               nasty things to knees and wrists.


                                     gene
                         whoops.

               he stands over them with lynn.

                                     gene
                         now, see, this is why you should 
                         always wear a helmet and knee pads. 
                         you never know when you're going to 
                         fall down and go boom. right?

                                     lynn
                         right.

               angle on mr. smith and ms. jones. - 12:11pm

                                     mr. smith
                         perfect.

               he starts forward.

                                     ms. jones
                              (not so sure)
                         perfect.

               she follows. they intercept gene. mr. smith flashes a badge.

                                     mr. smith
                         could i see some identification, 
                         sir?

                                     gene
                         what?

                                     ms. jones
                              (ditto with the badge)
                         i.d. could we see some?

                                     gene
                         uh, sure. what's, what's the problem? 
                         will a driver's license do?

                                     mr. smith
                         that'll do just fine.

               gene pulls out his wallet, surprised and confused. mr. smith 
               looks at it.


                                     gene
                         is this about those kids? look, i'm 
                         sorry about that. but they darn 
                         near...

                                     mr. smith
                         you're from santa maria, mr. watson?

                                     gene
                         yes.

                                     ms. jones
                         where's that?

                                     gene
                         near lompoc, north. what's...

                                     mr. smith

                                     gene

                                     mr."smith
                         don't cause a ruckus, sir.

               he pulls open his coat, putting his hands on his hips, not-
               so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun.

                                     mr. smith
                         you don't want to cause a ruckus, 
                         with the little girl and all.

                                     ms. jones
                         come with me, honey.

               ms. jones swoops lynn up and heads for the station entrance.

                                     gene
                         hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take 
                         the girl!

                                     mr. smith
                         don't worry. she's good with kids.

               gene hurries after ms. jones. mr. smith grabs up the 
               suitcases.
