               int. union station - day - 12:08pm

               whoosh! a security guard approaches the two rollerblading 
               teens. they circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away, 
               laughing.

               mr. smith and ms. jones continue trolling the passengers as 
               they come through the gate.

                                     ms. jones
                         skate-boarders i don't mind, even 
                         though they dress like fuckin' idiots, 
                         but when i see some pin-head on 
                         rollerblades, i get the definite 
                         urge to grease the grill of my car 
                         with 'em.

                                     mr. smith
                         keep your eyes peeled.

                                     ms. jones
                         what about them?


                                     mr. smith
                         too old.

               they're talking about a couple in their sixties, warmly 
               greeting each other.

                                     mr. jones
                         him!

                                     mr. smith
                         if you ever had an idea it would die 
                         of malnutrition. first those blue 
                         hairs then some spic.  leave this to 
                         me. i know people. it's my job. i'm 
                         a people person.

               mr. smith laughs at his joke.

                                     ms. jones
                         what the fuck are you looking for?

               mr. smith has spotted someone.

                                     mr. smith
                         i'm looking for them.

                                     ms. jones
                         where?

                                     mr. smith
                         right there.

               he starts walking towards the exit gate.
