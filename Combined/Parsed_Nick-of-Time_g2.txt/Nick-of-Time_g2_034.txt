               int. bonaventure hotel - shoeshine stand - day - 12:31pm

               back in real life, gene walks toward a shoeshine stand outside 
               the men's room. "huey's polished act" and below that, hand-
               lettered, "disabled veteran" where huey himself, a fiftyish 
               black man, reads a "smithsonian" magazine.

               he sees gene and perks up - a customer.

                                     huey
                         having a rough day? down at the heels 
                         as they...?

               but gene goes right past huey and into the men's room.

                                     huey
                              (calling after him)
                         you don't see your face, you don't 
                         pay!

               huey gives up, goes back to his magazine.
