               mr. smith, gene and huey in situ.

                                     gene
                         no, honey, not to be a hero. but i 
                         want you to remember something for 
                         me, all right?

                                     lynn (o.s.)
                              (filtered)
                         all right.

                                     gene
                         he's doing it for you. no matter 
                         what anybody tells you, no matter 
                         who they are, he's doing it for you, 
                         because he loves you.


                                     mr. smith
                         that's enough.

               he reaches for the walkie-talkie, but gene stares him down. 
               back to the walkie-talkie:

                                     gene
                         will you promise me that?

                                     lynn (o.s.)
                              (filtered)
                         i promise.

                                     gene
                         all right. kisses to you.

                                     lynn (o.s.)
                              (filtered)
                         no...kisses to you.

                                     gene
                         no. kisses to you.

                                     lynn (o.s.)
                              (filtered)
                         no, kisses to...

               mr. smith grabs the walkie-talkie.

                                     mr. smith
                         i don't care who the fuck you do it 
                         for just so you do it. hey.

               he reaches down, snaps his fingers in huey's face. huey looks 
               up.

                                     mr. smith
                         you done yet?

                                     huey
                         just about.

               he gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.

                                     huey
                         two dollars, if it pleases you.


                                     mr. smith
                         it doesn't. i remember when it was a 
                         fuckin' quarter.

               he throws a couple dollars to huey. to gene as he stalks 
               away:

                                     mr. smith
                         twenty-five minutes.

               to his back:

                                     huey
                         thanks for the tip.

               huey turns back to gene. they stare at each other.

                                     huey
                         mister, what are you dragging me 
                         into?

                                     gene
                         i'm not dragging you into anything. 
                         i don't expect...

                                     huey
                         cover your mouth.

                                     gene
                         what?

                                     huey
                         this gorilla's watching you, is that 
                         right?

                                     gene
                         that's right.

                                     huey
                         then don't let him be seeing you 
                         talking to me. i don't want him 
                         twisting my arm off.

               gene lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. huey 
               pretends to work on his shoes.

                                     huey
                         that was your kid on the walkie-
                         talkie?
 

                                     gene
                         my daughter. they have her in a van 
                         across the street. they say they'll 
                         kill her if i don't do something for 
                         them.

                                     huey
                         in twenty-five minutes in the 
                         california ballroom.

                                     gene
                         there was a woman. she was trying to 
                         help me. i watched him murder her.

                                     huey
                         what are you supposed to do?

                                     gene
                         kill the governor.

               huey checks his perimeters, then:

                                     huey
                         i knew i should have packed up and 
                         gone home as soon as i got that 
                         twenty. what am i supposed to do 
                         about this situation?

                                     gene
                         one of them is in on it. he might 
                         even be in charge. her security is 
                         in on it. there's only one person i 
                         know for sure isn't in on it.

                                     huey
                         who?

                                     gene
                         the governor. if i could just talk 
                         to her...

                                     huey
                         oh, jesus ...

                                     gene
                         no way, there's nothing you can do 
                         to help me.


                                     huey
                         then why'd you drag me into it?

                                     gene
                              (getting emotional)
                         it's my kid. i've got to...to 
                         somehow...do right by my little girl.

               he gets out her picture, stares at it.

                                     gene
                         it's about time i did. i was one of 
                         those guys, workaholics. i worked my 
                         ass off for them - my wife, my 
                         daughter.  that's just what i thought 
                         i was supposed to do.

                                     huey
                         yeah, all right, listen...

                                     gene
                              (running on)
                         so when she wanted a divorce...i 
                         was...i didn't know what i'd done 
                         wrong. i didn't see it. i didn't see 
                         it....

               huey takes his wooden brush and whacks gene on the foot, 
               snapping him from his downward spiral.

                                     huey
                         why don't you tell me about the early 
                         years some other time?

                                     gene
                         i'm sorry. you understand i don't 
                         mind dying if i could save my 
                         daughter. i mean that.

                                     huey
                         yeah, now listen.  i can't mess with 
                         these shoes any more or it's gonna 
                         look funny. you go down get yourself 
                         something to drink. make sure godzilla 
                         there, follows you.

                                     gene
                         what are you going to do?


                                     huey
                         i haven't the faintest idea. go on 
                         now. i'll get word to you.

               gene gets down.

                                     gene
                         if nothing else, someone heard my 
                         story.

               he gives huey a twenty.

                                     gene
                         keep the change.

                                     huey
                         don't think i won't.

               gene just stands there. huey has to give him a little push.
