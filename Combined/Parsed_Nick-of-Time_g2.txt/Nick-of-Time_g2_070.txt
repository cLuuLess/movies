               int. hotel bar - day - 1:11pm

               gene finds a stool at the empty part of the bar. the place 
               is half-full, noisy. the television is showing a game show.

               the bartender comes over.

                                     game show host (o.s.)
                              (over television)
                         ...and time is running out...

                                     gene
                         give me a ...a gingerale?

               mr. smith sits -at the other end of the bar. the bartender 
               gets him a beer. gene and mr. smith lock eyes in the mirror.  
               between them, a couple of t.v. news technicians are grabbing 
               a quick beer. a video camera resides on the bar by them.


               gene notices officer trust, walking by on a level above, 
               watching him.

                                     t.v. news technician 1
                         man, i thought she was going to get 
                         out the violins.

                                     tv reporter
                         no shit. if i hear that stop the 
                         violence routine one more time i'm 
                         going to shoot somebody.

               a waitress appears suddenly at gene's elbow, surprising him. 
               she puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next 
               to his drink.

                                     waitress
                         here's your ginger ale, sir.

                                     down the bar:
                         t.v. news technician 1 politicians.

                                     tv reporter
                         they're all the same.

               the waitress is tapping a long fingernail against the bar.

               gene looks down and sees it. a note on the coaster. "men's 
               room - huey."

               the waitress turns the coaster over, and leaves. gene looks 
               down the bar at mr. smith, drinking, unaware.

                                     tv reporter
                         you know what bothers me?

               gene looks at his watch.

               1:12.

                                     tv reporter
                         when they get all weepy eyed about 
                         the "ordinary citizen", the "regular 
                         joe", the "normal american". gimme a 
                         break. there ain't no such animal. 
                         we're a nation of two hundred forty 
                         million special interest groups.
 

               gene stands.

                                     gene
                         well, i'm just a regular guy.

               the t.v. news technicians stare at him.

                                     tv reporter
                         is that right?

                                     gene
                         yeah, that's right. but i've built a 
                         good solid business out of nothing. 
                         don't underestimate the regular guy.

               he heads for the open lobby.

                                     bartender
                         sir, you haven't paid.

                                     gene
                         it's on the special interest at the 
                         end of the bar.

               gene jerks a thumb at mr. smith and is gone. mr. smith starts 
               to follow him. the bartender is right with him.

                                     bartender
                         hey, sir, don't make me call a cop.

               mr. smith slaps some money on the bar and leaves.

                                     t.v. news technician 1
                         left field bleachers heard from.

                                     t.v. reporter
                         laughs.
