               int. cab - day - 12:22pm

               the cab pulls into the drive front of the bonaventure hotel 
               and stops.

                                     cabbie
                         i'd love to hear about your problem, 
                         but the ride's over. three-fifty.

               gene looks out the back window, watches the van pulls up to 
               the curb on the other side of the street.

                                     cabbie
                         three-fifty. i hope your problem 
                         doesn't have anything to do with my 
                         three-fifty.

               gene looks back at the cabbie, waiting for his fare.


                                     gene
                         right. right.

               gene digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his 
               business cards. he hurriedly writes on it: "help. van kidnap 
               child." he wraps a five around it, pushes it into the cabbie's 
               hand, gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab.
