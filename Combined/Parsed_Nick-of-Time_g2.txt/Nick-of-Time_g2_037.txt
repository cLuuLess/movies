               int. bonaventure hotel - shoeshine stand - day - 12:32pm

               huey sets down his magazine again.

                                     huey
                         having a rough day? down at the heels 
                         as they say? what you need is a shoe 
                         shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

               it's huey's usual patter, he's said it a thousand times. 
               gene looks around.

               mr. smith is in the lounge area, facing the flower street 
               entrance, able to keep the men's room and gene in view.

                                     huey
                         take ten, take a break, take a seat, 
                         take a load off. put the world in 
                         perspective.

               gene lets huey usher him into a chair.

               the gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the 
               chair. a grim reminder. he pulls out the itinerary.

               ecu - itinerary

               12:45  -  governor eleanor samara grant  -  pacific rim 
               multi-cultural conference  -  pool deck  -  fourth floor

               gene looks at his watch.

               ecu watch

               12:32.

               the minute hand clicks to 12:33 as he watches.

               angle on huey - 12:33pm

               he works away at gene's shoes.
 

                                     huey
                         so, are you a visitor or lucky enough 
                         to live in the city of angels?

               it's more of huey's patter, no real substance to the inquiry.

                                     gene
                         i'm...i'm visiting.

               gene watches mr. smith frown and amble toward the shoeshine 
               stand.

                                     huey
                         what do you do, if i may be so bold?

                                     gene
                              (looking at mr. smith)
                         i'm just an accountant.

                                     huey
                         don't denigrate yourself, my friend. 
                         where would the government be without 
                         accountants?  they wouldn't know how 
                         hard they can squeeze us before we 
                         pop, isn't that right?

               angle on mr. smith - 12:33pm

               he takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his 
               chair.

               angle on huey - 12:33pm

                                     huey
                         now you take tips. time was a tip 
                         was between a man and his customer. 
                         not any more. they've figured out 
                         what they call a formulae, don't 
                         laugh, it ain't for babies. they 
                         take your sales, see, and slap a 
                         percentile on there, figuring that 
                         somewhere between your lies and your 
                         bad luck they'll hit on the mean 
                         amount, mean meaning "in the middle", 
                         but if you ask me it means "just 
                         plain mean". why you can have uncle 
                         scrooge wring a nickel over your 
                         poor out-stretched palm, or daddy 
                         warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins 
                         like manna from heaven, don't make 
                         no difference, they'll tax your behind 
                         according to that same figure. doesn't 
                         seem quite right., does it?
 

                                     gene
                         no. no, it doesn't.

               the bellboy gustino walks by, calls out to huey.

                                     gustino
                         hey, huey, how's it hangin'?

                                     huey
                         it's a load, my friend, but somebody's 
                         got to carry it.

               gustino laughs, waves.

                                     gene
                         i have to do something.

                                     huey
                         what's that? you have to speak up.
                              (taps his ear)
                         i'm a little deaf in this ear. between 
                         that and my wooden leg i'm a mess. 
                         compliments of the united states 
                         army artillery corps.

                                     gene
                         i said i have to do something.

                                     huey
                         i'll have you out of here in two 
                         shakes o'f a lamb's tail.

                                     gene
                         is within himself.

               gene i keep wondering what she would do if she was here. 
               she'd figure it out. she'd run it down like a column of 
               numbers. pro's and cons. that's the way she was: lists all 
               over the house.

               huey's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in his 
               chair?


                                     gene
                         drove me crazy. there must have been 
                         one on me. i didn't add up so she 
                         left. that's what attracted me to 
                         her in the first place. she made up 
                         her mind and she did it. she wouldn't 
                         sit around waiting for...whatever. 
                         she'd do something. she'd do 
                         something.

               huey keeps his eyes on his work. he's afraid he's got a live 
               one.

                                     huey
                         yes, well, you know, for a quality 
                         shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. 
                         wears like iron. you're a wise man. 
                         there ya' go. two bucks.

               huey gestures for gene to get down. gene steps to the floor. 
               he pays huey with a twenty.

                                     huey
                         you got anything smaller?

                                     gene
                         keep it.

                                     huey
                         it's a twenty.

                                     gene
                         keep it.

               gene is thinking about something.

                                     huey
                         well...thanks muchly...

               gene looks around the lobby, at mr. smith, the flower street 
               entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket.

                                     gene
                         can i get out to flower street from 
                         here?

                                     huey
                         sure. go down past the bar. take you 
                         right out there.


               huey nods toward the bar.

                                     gene
                         thanks.

               gene walks toward the bar. huey shakes his head: time for 
               the boys in white.
