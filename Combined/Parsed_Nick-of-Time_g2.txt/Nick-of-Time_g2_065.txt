               gene comes out of the men's room, stands there at a loss.

                                     huey (o.s.)
                         having a rough day? down at the heels 
                         as they say? what you need is a shoe 
                         shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.

               gene looks around. huey has his nose in his magazine, calling 
               out his patter for whoever drifts by.
