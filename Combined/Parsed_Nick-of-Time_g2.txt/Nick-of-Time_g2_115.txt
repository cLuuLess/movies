               int. the van - day - 1:31pm

               ms jones looks to the back seat at lynn.

                                     lynn
                         why do you keep looking at me?


                                     ms. jones
                         that's my job. i'm your babysitter.

               as they talk ms. jones screws a silencer on her gun.

                                     lynn
                         i'm not a baby.

                                     ms. jones
                         you're a big girl, huh?

                                     lynn
                         i'm not a big girl but i'm not a 
                         baby.

               ms jones turns to face lynn.

                                     ms. jones
                         close your eyes.

                                     lynn
                         why?

                                     ms. jones
                         i've got something for you.

                                     lynn
                         a surprise?

                                     ms. jones
                         you ask too many questions. you want 
                         the surprise or not?

               lynn closes her eyes. ms. jones makes to do the deed.

               suddenly, huey appears behind her at the windshield.

                                     huey
                         good afternoon, madam. hello there, 
                         little girl.

               with a crumpled up newspaper he begins vigorously rubbing 
               the window. lynn's eyes pop open.

                                     ms. jones
                         hey, hey, what are you doing!?


                                     huey
                         just giving you the gift of a clean 
                         windshield. only cost you a dollar.

                                     ms. jones
                         i don't want my windshield cleaned.

                                     huey
                         you just think you don't want your 
                         windshield cleaned.

                                     ms. jones
                         no, i know i don't want it cleaned. 
                         get out of here.

                                     huey
                         don't be like that. think of me as 
                         the moses of dirty windshields leading 
                         you through the desert of dead bugs.

               lynn laughs.

                                     ms. jones
                         for the last time, i don't want it 
                         cleaned. now get the hell out of 
                         here!

                                     huey
                         it's already done. i've already done 
                         it. you have to pay me now.

                                     ms. jones
                         i don't have to pay you nothin'.

                                     huey
                         you're going to deny me a lousy dollar 
                         after i've sweated like a pig giving 
                         you the gift of a clean windsheild?

                                     ms. jones
                         fuckin' a.

                                     huey
                         i don't think so.

               he reaches in the passenger's window.


                                     ms. jones
                         hey!

                                     huey
                         i think this is worth a dollar.

               he snatches the walkie-talkie off the seat.

                                     ms. jones
                         goddamnit! gimme that!

               she lunges across. huey dangles the walkie-talkie before 
               her.

                                     huey
                         oh, we'll have to do better than 
                         that.

                                     ms. jones
                         you worthless piece of shit! gimme 
                         that!

               she throws open the passenger door, climbs out.
