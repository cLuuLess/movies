               eleanor grant looks at gene for a long moment.

                                     eleanor grant

                         mister wat... gene.

               gene nods, smiles.

                                     eleanor grant
                         i would also like to apologize.

                                     gene
                         for what?

                                     eleanor grant
                         for not believing you.

                                     gene
                         believe me, i don't blame you.
                              (to lynn)
                         this is the governor, lynn. say hello.

               lynn lets go of her father with one of her hands, gives a 
               shy little wave.

               the governor reaches out, strokes the little girl's hair.


                                     eleanor grant
                         you have a very brave father, lynn.

               lynn looks up.

                                     lynn
                         he's a hero.

                                     eleanor grant
                         yes, yes he is.

                                     lynn
                         dads are like that.

               she goes back to clinging to her father.  gene looks like he 
               might cry he, loves her so much.

                                     gene
                         can we go now?

                                     eleanor grant
                         of course. i'll get a car to drive 
                         you.

                                     gene
                         no, that's... that's ok. we don't 
                         need any help. we'll be just fine. 
                         won't we, lynn?

               lynn nods. eleanor grant offers her hand to gene.

                                     eleanor grant
                         good luck.

                                     gene
                         same to you.

               eleanor grant walks away. the press renews their assault.

               huey and gene look at each other. then:

                                     gene
                         thanks for the shine.

                                     huey
                         thanks for the tip.


                                     gene
                              (to lynn)
                         come on, kid. i gotta make a phone 
                         call.

               he gets up wearily, carrying his daughter, grabs his 
               briefcase, and heads away. lynn peeks back over his shoulder 
               at huey, shyly waves. huey points at her.

                                     huey
                         kisses to you.

               lynn laughs, comes to life.

                                     lynn
                         no, kisses to you!

                                     huey
                         no, kisses to you.
