               int. emerald bay room - day - 12:28pm

               it is emptying, that's where the crowd came from. gene comes 
               in.

               a woman is heading for the door with a centerpiece she's 
               just copped.

                                     gene
                         excuse me, is the...thing over?

                                     woman
                         yes. you didn't miss much. the 
                         food...chicken again.

                                     gene
                         eleanor grant is gone?

                                     woman
                         yes. nice speech. but it's the same 
                         at all these...

               but gene has turned away. the woman gives him a face, grabs 
               another centerpiece and exits. a clean-up crew is starting 
               to go through the room. gene leans against a wall, breathing 
               through a combination of relief and agony.

               mr. smith is suddenly next to him.

                                     mr. smith
                         check your itinerary. move along.


               gene gets out the itinerary. "12:30 - 12:45 - hors d'oeuvres/ 
               buffet w/friends of eleanor samara grant - invitation only -
               bona vista lounge".

                                     gene
                         this says "invitation only".

                                     mr. smith
                         of course you're invited. you're a 
                         big donor to the campaign. they love 
                         you.

               mr smith digs  into the manila envelope, comes out with a 
               handful of security badges, name tags, invites. he plucks 
               the name tag that ms jones printed earlier. it has a red 
               ribbon signifying a major donor to the campaign. he fastens 
               it to gene's lapel.

                                     mr. smith
                         this'11 get you in anywhere.  red 
                         elevator. thirty-fifth floor.

                                     gene
                         where did you get these? who are 
                         you?

                                     mr. smith
                         i'm the guy who's going to kill your 
                         daughter if you don't get moving.
