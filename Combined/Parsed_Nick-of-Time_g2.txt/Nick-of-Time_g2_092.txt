               int. room 2510 - day - 1:21pm

               the clock on the nightstand.

               1:21.

               eleanor grant sits against the headboard. gene sits on the 
               edge of the bed, the gun all but forgotten, held loosely in 
               his hand.

                                     gene
                         i knew you wouldn't believe me.

                                     eleanor grant
                         i said i'd listen to you, not 
                         necessarily believe you. you're 
                         telling me my people are in a plot 
                         against me. you're telling me my 
                         husband wants me killed. what do you 
                         expect?
 

                                     gene
                         i don't blame you. i don't have any 
                         proof. but nothing like this occurs 
                         in a vacuum. you can't be totally 
                         oblivious. you must suspect something. 
                         you're doing things which are making 
                         people angry. people who have been 
                         in power a long time are losing their 
                         jobs. you know them better than me. 
                         how much does it mean to them?  how 
                         far would they go to hang onto it?

               her eyes go inward, reflecting a vague doubt. gene sees it, 
               hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor. 
               excited by it, he gets up, forgets to cover her so closely.

                                     gene
                         there's only one way to find out for 
                         sure. try to cancel the last speech.

                                     eleanor grant
                              (smiling, covering 
                              her inner thought)
                         i'd prefer we didn't refer to it as 
                         my last speech.

                                     gene
                         it's the last chance they have for 
                         me to kill you. try to get out of 
                         it. they won't let you. they can't. 
                         try to change the schedule and you'll 
                         know i'm right. what have you got to 
                         lose? it comes down to who you trust, 
                         them or me? test them.

                                     eleanor grant
                         i love it when pistolero's talk of 
                         trust.

               gene, across the room looks at the gun in his hand. he takes 
               the plunge.

                                     gene
                         this? i've never even fired one.

                                     eleanor grant
                         indeed.

               eleanor grant's hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging 
               the room into blackness.


                                     eleanor grant
                              (in the blackness)
                         franco! franco.'

               gene slips out into the hall as the connecting room door 
               flies open. light from the other room spills in. franco rushes 
               in, pulling a gun.
