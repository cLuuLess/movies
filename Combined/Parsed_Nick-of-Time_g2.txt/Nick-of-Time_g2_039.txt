               int. hotel bar area - day - 12:3 6pm

               gene walks into the area of the bar. the bartender is just 
               returning to chat with a customer, a reporter who is getting 
               sloshed. gene moves slowly along the bar, into an area where 
               mr. smith's view of him is blocked.

                                     reporter
                         so where was i?

                                     bartender
                         i don't know. something about the 
                         governor's new regime.

               gene hears this and glances towards them.

                                     reporter
                         oh yeah. she's dumping the good old 
                         boys like yesterday's newspapers.


               gene sees that mr.smith can no longer see him. he scans the 
               lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto flower street.

                                     reporter
                         the white boys are in for it. when 
                         they got her elected they never 
                         thought she was gonna make the 
                         governor's office look like the united 
                         nations.

               the bartender laughs. gene quickly cuts across the lobby and 
               out the smaller door onto flower street.

                                     reporter
                         we're talking custer's last stand 
                         here. the only minorities not on her 
                         staff are the ones still lost in the 
                         rain forest.
