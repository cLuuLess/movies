               ext. bonaventure hotel - day - 12:23pm

               gene watches the cab leave. as it exits, the cabbie's arm 
               snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. gene knows what 
               it is. he looks around.

               valets, bellmen, arrivals and departees, cars coming and 
               going. no one pays particular attention to him.

               gene looks at the van across the street. mr. smith gets out 
               and walks across the street towards him. the van drives away.

               gene watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately 
               hanging onto the last glimpse of it.


               mr. smith takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. gene 
               goes into the hotel.
