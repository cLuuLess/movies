               int. twenty-fifth floor - elevator foyer - day - 12:58pm

               they reach the elevator. mr. smith punches the button. gene 
               turns on him.

                                     gene
                         how am i supposed to get away?

                                     mr. smith
                         that's not my problem, mr. watson

               he gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it.

                                     mr. smith
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         come back.

                                     gene
                         how do i know you won't kill my 
                         daughter once i'm gone?


                                     mr. smith
                              (into the walkie-talkie)
                         come back....fucking radio.

               mr. smith is getting nothing but static. he angrily keys 
               off, hisses at gene:

                                     mr.smith
                         i told you she'd be alright, if you 
                         do your job.

                                     gene
                         and i'm supposed to trust you?

                                     mr. smith
                         what choice do you have?

               the elevator doors open. mr. smith gestures graciously.

                                     mr. smith
                         after you.
