               by:

                                     cabbie

                                     cabbie
                         oh, san diego? i've thought about 
                         moving to san diego.  it's hard to 
                         make a living in this town. these 
                         short hops.  can't make a dime on 
                         'em. to lax, pasadena, then i can 
                         make a buck. these little hops cost 
                         me money.

                                     gene
                         sorry.

                                     cabbie
                         's okay. what do you think?

                                     gene
                         huh?

                                     cabbie
                         better in san diego? more opportunity 
                         there? what?

                                     gene

                         there. i was just visiting...a grave.

                                     cabbie
                         aw, too bad.

               they lapse into silence. gene starts to open the envelope 
               again.

                                     cabbie
                         somebody close?

                                     gene

                                     cabbie
                         the grave. somebody close?


                                     gene
                         wife. ex-wife. almost ex. we were 
                         separated. she was thinking about a 
                         divorce.

               gene notices the dashboard clock -

               12:22

               gene leans forward.

                                     gene
                         look...i've... i've got a problem. a 
                         big problem...

                         oh, yeah?

               he hits the horn and swerves to the left.

                                     cabbie
                         jesus! watch it, buddy!
