               int. room 2503 - day - 12:5 6pm

               ...he hits the floor, thrown there by mr. smith. his escape 
               has been a dream. a wrist-watch fills the frame.

               12:56.


               it is gene's. we are seeing his p.o.v. he's laying on the 
               floor, his watch-hand in front of his face.

                                     mystery man (o.s.)
                         you nearly killed him, too, you idiot!

                                     mr. smith (o.s.)
                         nearly doesn't count.

               lose the p.o.v.

                                     brendan grant
                         i'm on record. i never wanted this. 
                         i wanted simplicity; a telescopic 
                         sight, a powerful rifle, but no. 
                         what was good enough for oswald wasn't 
                         good enough for you two. you had to 
                         get fancy. drag some shmuck in off 
                         the street, stick a gun in his hand.

                                     mystery man
                         it's academic now. she had to be 
                         killed.

                                     mr. smith
                         what were you going to do, brendan? 
                         lock her in a closet?  you're in the 
                         fucking kitchen now. get used to the 
                         heat. he's been seen all over the 
                         hotel, looking like some loony tunes. 
                         we even got him on video. it'll work. 
                         don't worry about it.

               gene stirs on the floor.

                                     mystery man
                         (about gene) is he awake?

                                     mr. smith
                         yeah.

               he yanks gene to his feet.

                                     brendan grant
                         oh great. why don't we just give him 
                         our home phone numbers while we're 
                         at it?


                                     mr. smith
                         it doesn't matter what he hears.

               he pulls gene over to the bathroom door. throws it open. 
               gene reacts to what he sees within.

                                     mr. smith
                         that's what it looks like. she was 
                         alive a minute ago. now she's dead. 
                         because you wouldn't do what i told 
                         you to do.

                                     mystery man
                         get going. you've only got a few 
                         minutes to pull it together.

               mr. smith takes gene out of the suite into the hall.  the 
               door closes. brendan, the mystery man and officer trust are 
               alone brendan grant i don't know if we should go through 
               with this.

                                     mystery man
                         it's too late for that.

                                     brendan grant
                         there is a dead woman on my bathroom 
                         floor!

                                     mystery mam
                         what about it? she's eleanor's 
                         assistant and they will have been 
                         shot with the same gun, by the same 
                         lunatic.  some, anonymous loser who 
                         went over the edge.

                                     brendan grant
                              (breathing easier)
                         only thing better would be if he 
                         were a postal worker.

                                     officer trust
                         he won't be doing any work once i 
                         get through with him.

                                     mystery man
                         and in a few months you're in the 
                         governor's mansion. the people'd 
                         make you king of california if they 
                         could.
 

               brendan grant laughs.
