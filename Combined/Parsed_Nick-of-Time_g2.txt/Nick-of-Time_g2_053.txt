               int. room 2503 - day - 12:51pm

               upscale suite. brendan grant's coat is draped on a chair. 
               krista moves past him, pulling gene.

                                     gene
                              (to krista)
                         we have to hurry.

                                     krista
                         i know. brendan, listen to me. someone 
                         is trying to kill eleanor.

                                     brendan grant
                         what? what are you talking about?

                                     krista
                         we need people we can "trust. we 
                         only have a few moments...

                                     brendan grant
                         this is...this is insane. how do you 
                         know this?

                                     gene
                         i know it because i'm the one who's 
                         supposed to kill her.

                                     brendan grant
                         you are!?
                              (to krista)
                         you brought this man here!? you 
                         brought this man to my room!?

                                     krista
                         i had to. her security people may be 
                         involved...

               there is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent 
               bathroom. the door opens and a man emerges drying his hands 
               on a hotel towel. he is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, 
               perhaps wearing glasses.
 

                                     mystery man
                         is there a problem, brendan?

                                     brendan grant
                         there certainly is. this man says 
                         he's been hired to kill eleanor.

                                     gene
                         not hired. they're blackmailing me.

                                     mystery man
                         who is this "they"?

                                     gene
                         i don't...i don't know. please, mr. 
                         grant! they have my daughter. i'm 
                         not some lunatic. your wife is in 
                         trouble.  someone is trying to kill 
                         her. someone is trying to make me 
                         kill her. please, listen...

                                     mystery man
                         and on the strength of this story, 
                         you bring this man to brendan's suite?  
                         does that show good judgment, ms. 
                         brooks?  i'm just a friend of 
                         brendan's, but it seems to me...

                                     krista
                         he brought a gun onto the pool deck.

                                     mystery man
                              (beat)
                         what?

                                     krista
                         he got onto the pool deck with a 
                         gun. how did he get past her security 
                         carrying a

                                     mystery man
                         i see. where is this gun?

                                     krista i
                         have it.


                                     mystery man
                         well, is it real? do we know anything 
                         about it?

                                     krista
                         it looks real. i don't know anything 
                         about guns.

                                     mystery man
                         could i see it?

               krista gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands 
               it to him. it lays in the palm of his hand. he unwraps it 
               awkwardly, examines it.

                                     mystery man
                         my goodness. it certainly looks real.

               he looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.

                                     mystery man
                         what's your opinion? you're the expert 
                         in these matters, supposedly.

               gene turns, to see who he is talking to.

               angle on doorway - 12:.53pm

               mr. smith stands by the open door. before gene can speak, 
               mr. smith moves. it is fluid and cohtroled and fast. he 
               marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the 
               couch. he takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and 
               goes face to face with krista. she just has time to wonder 
               what is going on there is a double muffled gunshot. shock 
               fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. gene can only stand 
               there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.

                                     brendan grant
                         jesus christ!

                                     mr. smith
                              (calmly, staring at 
                              gene)
                         yeah, i'd say it's real.

                                     mystery man
                         are you out of your fucking mind!?


               the door opens. officer trust slides in quickly.

                                     officer trust
                         somebody mind telling me...
                              (sees krista's body))
                         what the hell happened!?

                                     mr. smith
                         help me get her off the rug.

               officer trust checks the hall, shuts the door. they begin to 
               drag her body to the bathroom. the mystery man watches.

                                     brendan grant
                         what have you done to me!? christ 
                         almighty!

               gene's eyes follow them. as if rousing from a sleep he comes 
               to life.

                                     gene
                         no!

               he tries to rush to the bathroom but mr. smith is right there, 
               gripping him. gene struggles frantically, uselessly, watching 
               the bathroom door close. mr. smith is beyond anger. he grabs 
               gene's throat, muscles down. gene grips the iron hand that's 
               cutting off his air.

                                     mr. smith
                         you fucked up.

                                     mystery man (o.s.)
                         that's enough.

               the mystery man grabs mr. smith's arm, tries to pry him loose. 
               mr. smith is beyond reason.

                                     mr. smith
                         you want me to kill your kid!? you 
                         want me to kill you!?

               gene's eyes begin to roll back in his head. everything begins 
               fading to black.

               the blackness retreats in a rush and gene finds himself 
               staring at the butt of mr. smith's gun, visible under his 
               coat. he reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point-blank 
               into
 

               mr. smith, again, again. mr. smith's shocked face falls away. 
               gene heads for the door.

                                     mystery man
                         don't let him go!

               officer trust steps between gene and the door. gene shoots 
               him down and is out the door.
