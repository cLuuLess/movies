               int. men's room - day - 1:24pm

               mr. smith bursts into the men's room. he goes to the stall 
               and lifts his fist to pound on the door.

                                     mr. smith
                         out of there, mr. watson! your time's 
                         up!

               the stall door opens and gene comes out, zipping up his pants. 
               he brushes right past mr. smith, heads for the door. mr. 
               smith reaches out, grabs him.

                                     mr. smith
                         you forgot to wash your hands.

               he throws him against the sinks. gene washes his hands. mr. 
               smith leans against the sink next to him in the mirror above 
               the sink, gene sees the stall door swings open. gustino is 
               huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. mr. smith 
               doesn't notice.

                                     mr. smith
                         i've got faith in you, mr. watson. i 
                         know you're not just a regular guy, 
                         see, i know that. even if you don't 
                         know it yourself. maybe that's why i 
                         picked you.
 

               gene steps between mr. smith and the open stall door.

                                     gene
                         i know what i have to do. i'll do 
                         it. let's go.

               and'they exit the men's room. gustino slumps with relief.
