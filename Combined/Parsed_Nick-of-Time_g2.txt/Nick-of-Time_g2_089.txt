               int. room 2510 - 1:18pm

               lit only by a bedside lamp. eleanor grant is laying on the 
               bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a 
               pair of pillows. gene edges over slowly to her. he stands 
               over her, not knowing how to begin.

                                     gene
                              (softly)
                         excuse me...

               eleanor grant lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes.

                                     eleanor grant
                         who the hell are you?

               she sits upright, reaches for the phone! gene moves, putting 
               his hand on top of hers on top of the phone.
 

                                     gene
                         no, please.

               they stare at each other for a beat.

               she bolts for the door! gene beats her to it! she backs up 
               to the bed.

               eleanor grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not 
               fearless.

                                     gene
                         mrs. grant, governor...i won't hurt 
                         you.

                                     eleanor grant
                         my security people are right next 
                         door.

                                     gene

                                     eleanor grant
                         one loud scream will bring them in 
                         here instantly. you won't get very 
                         far. think it over.

                                     gene
                         if i were here to hurt you i would 
                         have done it already.

                                     eleanor grant
                         that's...a comfort to hear.

                                     gene
                         i have a problem.

                                     eleanor grant
                         ah.

                                     gene

                         to say, my problem is your problem, 
                         mrs. grant.

               she studies him.
 

                                     eleanor grant
                         i remember you...in the elevator.

                                     gene
                         that's right.

                                     eleanor grant
                         you were very nervous.

                                     gene
                         it was because i had this...in my 
                         pocket

               he slowly pulls out the gun. she takes it in.

                                     gene
                         i need you to listen to me. carefully. 
                         three lives depend on you listening 
                         very carefully to what i have to 
                         say.

               she smiles.

                                     eleanor grant
                              (friendly as can be)
                         of course. but suppose we set up an 
                         appointment. i have an important 
                         speech to deliver and you're cutting 
                         into my nap time.

               very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone eleanor 
               grant my assistant, krista brooks, takes care of 
               constituent...

                                     gene
                         krista brooks is dead.

               she freezes, slowly replaces the phone.

                                     eleanor grant
                         how do you know that?

                                     gene
                         i saw her die. she was shot. with 
                         this gun.

               she turns to him.
 

                                     eleanor grant
                         you shot her?

                                     gene
                         no.

                                     eleanor grant
                         who did?

                                     gene
                         i don't know. the only thing i know 
                         about him is that he works for your 
                         husband.

                                     eleanor grant
                         what?

                                     gene
                         and your husband works for somebody 
                         else.

                                     eleanor grant
                         what the hell are you saying?

               gene glances at the bedside clock.

               1:19.

               he looks back to the governor.
