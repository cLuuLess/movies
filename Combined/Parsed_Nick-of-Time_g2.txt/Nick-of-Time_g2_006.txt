               gene has emerged with lynn. they pause there, getting their 
               bearings. next to them, a young couple is kissing. they can't 
               keep their hands off each other.

                                     gene
                         i gotta make a phone call, lynn. do 
                         you see a phone?

               lynn has seen the young couple. she secretly points to them, 
               covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. gene 
               laughs.


                                     gene
                         come on, you.

               they start walking across the concourse, towards mr. smith 
               and ms. jones.

                                     gene
                              (to lynn)
                         haven't you ever seen anybody kiss 
                         like that?

                                     lynn
                         on tv.

                                     gene
                         you never saw your mom and me kiss 
                         like that?

               lynn suddenly gets very sad. she looks at the ground, slows 
               down. gene notices. he stops, crouches down to her level. 
               mr. smith and ms. jones, nearing them, split apart, move 
               around them, and keep going.

                                     gene
                              (to lynn)
                         hey, it's ok to talk about her. you 
                         can talk about her all you want. you 
                         know that, don't you?

               lynn nods.

                                     gene
                         so, come on. you never saw us kiss 
                         like that?

                                     lynn
                         no way.

                                     gene
                         how did you see us kiss?

               lynn gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss.

                                     gene
                         that's it? that little peck of a 
                         kiss? oh, brother, you missed some 
                         kisses.


               lynn laughs and throws herself on her dad. he holds her to 
               him, looks to the sky for help.. he finds himself staring at 
               the big clock.

               12:10.

                                     gene
                         ooh, i'm gonna be late. i gotta call.
