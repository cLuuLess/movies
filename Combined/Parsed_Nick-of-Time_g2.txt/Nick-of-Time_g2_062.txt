               int. men's room - day - 1:01pm

               gene staggers over to the row of sinks. leaning on one sink 
               with both hands, his body shudders violently. and he throws 
               up.

               a man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks. he 
               sees gene retching, turns away in disgust, and leaves quickly.

               gene turns on the faucets.to wash the mess away.

               he tries to clean up, but catches his reflection in the 
               mirror. he has trouble looking himself in the eye.
