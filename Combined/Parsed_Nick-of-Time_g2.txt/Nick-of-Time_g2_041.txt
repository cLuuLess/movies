               the first thing he sees, fixates on, is lynn. she is stretched 
               out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. she appears dead.

                                     gene
                              (a gasp)
                         lynn!

                                     ms. jones (o.s.)
                         shhh. you'll wake the baby up.

               ms. jones is sitting on the seat behind the one lynn is on. 
               gene points the gun at her face. she smiles.


                                     ms. jones
                              (softly)
                         what we have here is what they call 
                         a mexican standoff. the thing you 
                         gotta ask yourself is, "what's behind 
                         the seat?"  now, a twenty-two'd go 
                         right through it, but even a button 
                         will throw a twenty-two off so there's 
                         a good chance it'd get screwed up 
                         somewhere along the way, miss the 
                         target. maybe a thirty-eight?  a 
                         thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight,
                         unless it hits metal, then it'll 
                         bust up in little bitty pieces. 
                         they'll keep going but they'll be 
                         slowed down quite a bit. how's about 
                         a three-fifty-seven?  it'll go through 
                         the seat, her, you, the dashboard, 
                         shit, it'll go through the engine 
                         block before it knows it's hit 
                         anything, end up in some pedestrian 
                         three blocks away. what do you think? 
                         what's my poison?

               gene look at lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. 
               he lowers the gun, defeated.

                                     ms. jones
                         well it's a comfort to know you've 
                         got the co-jones to pull that thing 
                         out. whether you've got the balls to 
                         pull the trigger we've still got to 
                         see.
