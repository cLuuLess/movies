               ext. behind the platform - day - 12:47pm

               hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe 
               of the crowd, gene confronts krista, covering her with the 
               pocketed gun. in the background, eleanor grant delivers a 
               ringing speech, accented with applause.

                                     gene
                         please...please...you have to believe 
                         me... they have my daughter.  they 
                         want me to kill eleanor grant Â— or 
                         they'll kill my daughter.

               krista tries to edge away.

                                     krista
                         all right, let's just...let's get 
                         security in on this.

                                     gene
                         no! you can't! they're in on it.

                                     krista
                         i don't see how they could be in on 
                         it. they're the best. they're hand-
                         picked.
 

                                     gene
                         i don't know. one of them is following 
                         me. if he knew what i'd just told 
                         you they'd...

               gene pulls the gun from his pocket. she recoils, thinking 
               he's going to shoot her.

                                     gene
                         look, how did i get in here with 
                         this!?

               krista stares at the gun. she can't deny the fact.

                                     krista
                         i don't know.

                                     gene
                         you've got to trust me. i'm putting 
                         my daughter's life in your hands. 
                         she's only six. she's just a little 
                         girl. please, please, trust me.

                                     krista
                         it's a little hard to trust you under 
                         the circumstances.

               gene looks at her intently.

                                     gene
                         you're right, it is.
                              (beat)
                         here.

               gene offers krista the gun. she is surprised, to say the 
               least. she takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her 
               fingers.

                                     gene
                         will you trust me now?

               she stares at the gun, at the strange man.

                                     krista
                         i guess i'll have to. come on, there's 
                         one person we can go to.
 

                                     gene
                         the man following me has a walkie-
                         talkie. if he sees i'm not here he'll 
                         call his partner. i do anything out 
                         of line and he'll send the word to 
                         kill my daughter.

                                     krista
                         he'll think you're in the crowd until 
                         the end of the speech. wait a minute.

               she steps closer to the platform/ listens. eleanor grant's 
               voice is heard.

                                     eleanor grant (o.s.)
                         ...i remember that horrible night as 
                         if it were yesterday. a phone call 
                         pulling me out of sleep, the terrible 
                         news...

               krista checks her watch.

               12:48.

                                     eleanor grant (o.s.)
                         my husband and child senselessly 
                         killed by a drunk driver.

                                     krista
                         we've got about ten minutes.

                                     gene
                         are you sure?

                                     krista
                         i've heard this speech a lot. come 
                         on. we'll take care of him.  we will.

                                     gene
                         but...

                                     krista
                         trust me. you asked me for help. let 
                         me help. trust me.

                                     gene
                         okay...

               she starts to lead him away.
 

                                     gene
                         hey.

               he stops her, points to the gun she still holds.

                                     gene
                         i think you better put that away.

                                     krista
                         i think you're right.

               she pulls out a handkerchief, covers the gun and tucks it 
               out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away.
