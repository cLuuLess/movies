               int. third floor "green" elevator lobby - day - 12:59pm

               gene gets out of the elevator, almost getting caught in the 
               closing doors. he can't even fight back at the doors. they 
               pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear 
               of the elevator. gene stifles a retch, hurries away.

               mr. smith is standing there. childish giggles erupt from the 
               walkie-talkie.

                              (filtered, giggling)
                         daddy, did you hear me scream?
