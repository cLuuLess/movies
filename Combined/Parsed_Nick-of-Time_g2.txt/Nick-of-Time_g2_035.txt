               int. men's room. - day - 12:31pm

               gene goes- over to one of the sinks, runs the cold water, 
               splashes his face, looks in the mirror, into his own eyes.  
               he tries to find an answer, a way out. a pay phone, on the 
               wall behind him, comes into focus. then a hand reaches in, 
               grabs the receiver...and yanks it, snapping the wire.  gene 
               spins around.  it is mr. smith, of course.
 

               mr. smith smiles. gene doesn't. mr. smith leaves.
