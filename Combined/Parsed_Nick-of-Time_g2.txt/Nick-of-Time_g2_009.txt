               int. union station - souvenir shop - day - 12:11pm

               ms. jones nears a souvenir stand. the owner is looking the 
               other way. without breaking stride, ms. jones reaches out, 
               snatches a child's coloring book and crayons.

                                     lynn
                         you stole that.

                                     ms. jones
                         no, i didn't. i confiscated it. 
                         there's a difference.

               and they're out the door, gene hurrying after. the big hand 
               on the big clock moves.

               12:12.
