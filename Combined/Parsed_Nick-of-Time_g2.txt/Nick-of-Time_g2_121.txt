               int. bonaventure hotel - shoeshine stand - later - 2:26pm

               at huey's shoe-shine stand, gene and huey sit in the shoe- 
               shining chairs. they are variously bandaged. lynn is on gene's 
               lap. she clings to him, .her face buried against him.

               they are guarded by cops.

                                     huey
                         what time is it?

               gene looks at his wrist, gives an ironic smile.

                                     gene
                         lost my watch.

               a hub bub catches their attention.


               angle on lobby area-below - 2:26pm

               a handcuffed brendan grant is lead out by state police. press 
               flock around them - shouting questions.

               eleanor grant watches her husband taken out.

               the press descends on her like ducks on bread crumbs. 
               questions litter the air like confetti.

                                     eleanor grant
                         any comment at this time would be 
                         most premature. please, we'll have 
                         something for you in a couple of 
                         hours. please...

               eleanor grant finally makes her way toward gene. cops keep 
               the press back.
