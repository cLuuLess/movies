               int. union station - day - 12:07pm

               a man and a woman stand with a view of the arrival doors. 
               he's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. she's his 
               beefy counterpart.

                                     announcer (v.o.)
                         ...santa barbara, lompoc...


               the guy (mr. smith) checks his watch.

                                     announcer (v.o.)
                         ...santa maria, san luis obispo...

               then he looks up to the big clock.

               12:07.

               the minute hand slams into the "8".

                                     announcer
                         ...and points north.

               he resets his watch as disembarking passengers pour out of 
               the gate. people run forward with kisses and hugs.

                                     mr. smith
                         look sharp.

               they stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the 
               crowd.

                                     ms. jones

               motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband 
               follows with the suitcases.
