               int. cab - day - 12:23pm

               the cabbie finds the secreted card, but looks at the wrong 
               side.

                                     cabbie
                         what do i want with an accountant?

               a doorman leans down at the window.

                                     doorman
                         i got one for the airport. you free?

                                     cabbie
                         you bet.

               the doorman plants a passenger in the cab. as he pulls away, 
               the cabbie again glances at the business card, crumples it 
               up.
