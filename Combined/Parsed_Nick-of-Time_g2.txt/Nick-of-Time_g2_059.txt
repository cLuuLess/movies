               int. "blue" elevator - day - 12:58pm

               they step into the elevator. stare at each other. the doors 
               close. mr. smith erupts. he grabs gene slams him into the 
               outside window. gene's face is smashed into the glass by mr. 
               smith's shoulder. his body presses gene against the glass 
               wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from gene's ear.

                                     mr. smith
                         look out there! you see the van?

               the van can be seen below on flower street.

                                     mr. smith
                         you see it?!

               wham! he slams gene's head against the window. he lifts up 
               the walkie-talkie.

                                     mr. smith
                         come back.


                                     ms. jones (v.o.)
                              (filtered)
                         yeah.

                                     mr. smith
                         do it!

               he jabs the walkie-talkie next to gene's ear.

                                     lynn (v.o.)
                              (filtered)
                         daddy...?

               and then a scream. the horrible sound of a little girl in 
               terrible pain. it cuts through gene like a stab in the heart.

                                     gene
                         lynn!

               he struggles to turn around. mr. smith kidney punches him, 
               hard! gene goes down on one knee.

               the car stops. someone starts to board it, stops in surprise. 
               mr. smith sticks a badge in their face.

                                     mr. smith
                         security. take the next car.

               they back off. the doors close, the car continues its descent.

               mr. smith lifts the walkie-talkie.

                                     mr. smith
                         again.

                                     gene
                              (a gasp)
                         no, please...

               another bone-chilling scream from the walkie-talkie. gene is 
               ripped to his soul. mr. smith hauls him to his feet, shoves 
               him against the glass.

                                     mr. smith
                         you got one last chance. half an 
                         hour and that kid is dead. i'll kill 
                         her myself. i'll rip her fucking 
                         head off right in front of you!


               mr. smith releases gene, who goes limp. the elevator doors 
               open onto the lobby.

               mr. smith gets out, straightening his tie, wiping the sweat 
               from his face.
