               int. "red elevator" - day - 12:29pm

               mr. smith is fuming, his face red. he explodes.

                                     mr. smith
                         she was right in front of you! what's 
                         wrong with you!?

               his fists clench. he seems about to lose control. he backs 
               gene into a corner, physically terrified.

                                     mr. smith
                         are you 'fucking with me!?

                                     gene
                         the gun...

                                     mr. smith
                         what about the gun?

                                     gene
                         it wasn't loaded. i didn't put the 
                         bullets in it.

                                     mr. smith
                         you...

               he raises a fist. struggles with the impulse to smash gene, 
               controls it. angrily, he takes the gun from gene's pocket, 
               expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket.
 

                                     mr. smith
                         you won't get many chances like that, 
                         mr. watson. that's the way life works. 
                         don't blow the next one.

               he indicates the glass,wall of the elevator with his eyes. 
               gene looks out and down.

               gene's pov

               the van. it's moving into a parking spot across from the 
               bonaventure, on flower street.
