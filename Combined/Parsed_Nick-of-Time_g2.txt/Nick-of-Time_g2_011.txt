               int. van -.day - 12:13pm

               lynn and ms. jones are in the back.

                                     ms. jones
                         let's get your seatbelt on. always 
                         gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that 
                         right?

               lynn resists.

                                     lynn
                         i want my daddy.


               gene climbs into the front passenger seat.

                                     ms. jones
                         there's your daddy. see? we're your 
                         daddy's friends.

               mr. smith climbs into the driver's seat.

                                     mr. smith
                         that's right. the policeman is your 
                         friend. isn't that right, daddy?

               gene looks down. mr.. smith has pulled his gun. he points it 
               casually so it's aiming through the seat in the general 
               direction of the little girl.

                                     mr. smith
                         daddy?

                                     gene
                         yes. it's ok, lynn. these are our 
                         friends.

                                     ms. jones
                         hey, would you look at this crazy 
                         car? everybody has their own radio. 
                         what do you think of that?

                                     lynn
                         everybody does?

                                     ms. jones
                         yep. and you can listen to it without 
                         anybody else listening. let's try it 
                         out.

               she puts some ear phones on her. she holds up the plug-in 
               end.

                                     ms. jones
                         this is what they call the jack. hi, 
                         jack!

                                     lynn
                         laughs.

                                     ms. jones
                         it goes in that little hole.


                                     lynn
                         let me do it.

               she plugs the jack in. ms. jones turns on the radio. lynn 
               gets a big smile on her face.

                                     lynn
                              (loudly)
                         it's loud!

               she goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, 
               etc., oblivious to all else.

                                     ms jones
                         removes a pro label machine from 
                         under the seat. she begins to type 
                         in several characters.

                                     mr. smith
                         let's get down to business.

                                     gene
                         who are you? you're not the police.

                                     ms. jones
                         brilliant.

               ms jones presses print on the labeller. a strip of plastic 
               emerges that she begins to apply to a name tag.  he looks 
               back to her. mr. smith whacks him on the knee with the gun. 
               it hurts.

                                     mr. smith
                         pay attention, mr. watson. pay 
                         attention and your daughter won't be 
                         hurt.

                                     gene
                         you wouldn't...

                                     ms. jones
                         try us.

               he looks back. she is caressing lynn's hair.

                                     gene
                         get your hands off her.

               he makes a move. mr. smith whacks his knee again, harder.


                                     mr. smith
                         mr. watson, you're not paying 
                         attention. your daughter's life 
                         depends on you. do you understand 
                         that?

               gene looks from mr. smith to ms. jones and back. he's having 
               a hard time focussing.

               she slips the nametag into a manila envelope beside her mr. 
               smith do you understand?

                                     gene
                         yes, yes, i understand.

                                     mr. smith
                         good.

               he takes the manila envelope from ms jones, tosses it in 
               gene's lap.

                                     mr. smith
                         this is for you. in it there is a 
                         picture of a woman and an itinerary. 
                         it is her itinerary. she is presently - 
                         are you listening, mr. watson?

                                     gene
                         yes, i'm listening.

                                     mr. smith
                         she is presently at the bonaventure 
                         hotel. that's right near here.

               he gestures. gene looks. the glassy bonaventure hotel is 
               glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises.

                                     mr. smith
                         when you leave this van you will get 
                         yourself a cab and take it to the 
                         bonaventure hotel. then you will 
                         take this.  

               mr. smith holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. from the 
               back, ms. jones hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. he puts it 
               in gene's hand, shows him what it is: a gun.


                                     mr. smith
                         ...and you will kill the woman whose 
                         picture is in there. not just shoot 
                         her, mind,! kill her. i'd recommend 
                         you empty the gun into her. close 
                         up. got all that?

               it takes a moment for it all to sink into gene's brain.

                                     gene
                         you're out of your mind.

                                     mr. smith
                         what's your point?

                                     gene
                         i will do no such thing.

                                     mr. smith
                         yes, you will, mr. watson.

               a "snap!" from the back seat. gene looks. ms. jones has broken 
               a carrot stick. she breaks another.

                                     ms. jones
                         don't worry. we'll take good care of 
                         the kid.

               she gives half the carrot stick to lynn, pops the other half 
               in her mouth and grinds it to pulp. mr. smith is checking 
               his watch.

                                     mr. smith
                         it is now 12:16. if the woman in the 
                         picture is alive at 1:30...
                              (holds up a walkie-
                              talkie)
                         ...i call my partner, your daughter 
                         is dead.

               he looks in the rear-view mirror to ms. jones.

                                     mr. smith
                         and what happens if i don't call 
                         you?

                                     ms. jones
                         i kill her anyway.


                                     mr. smith
                         did you hear that, mr. watson? do 
                         you understand?

               he taps the manila envelope.

                                     mr. smith
                         the woman in the picture...

               he indicates the back seat with his head.

                                     mr. smith
                         ...or your daughter.

               gene looks at his daughter.

                                     gene
                         oh, my god...

               mr. smith reaches over, puts the gun and manila envelope 
               into gene's pockets.

                                     mr. smith
                         god can't help her, mr. watson. only 
                         you can help her.

                                     ms. jones
                         only you.

                                     mr. smith
                         you're wasting time.

               he reaches across gene, opens the door and pushes him out, 
               then follows him. lynn takes off the ear-phones, tries to 
               undo her seatbelt.

                                     lynn
                         where is my daddy going?

               ms. jones wraps a big arm around her.

                                     ms. jones
                         he's going to help the police. your 
                         daddy is going to be a hero.

                                     lynn
                         my daddy is going to be a hero? like 
                         power rangers?


                                     ms. jones
                         just like power rangers.
