               int. room 2510 - day - 1:23pm

               eleanor grant stares up at franco, back-lit by the light 
               coming from the next room. it gleams off the gun he holds in 
               his hand. she stares from the gun up to his hulking frame.

                                     franco
                         what is it, governor!? what's wrong!?

               she hesitates.

                                     eleanor grant
                         i...i'm afraid i've had a bad dream, 
                         franco.
