ext.   bridge - night (3 am)

footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.
empty train blazes through. dangerous, deserted downtown
neighborhood. looks more like "war torn beirut", burnt
out cars and trash. the 18 year old's father, naked to
the waist, walks from the family mercedes over the
footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-
derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of
fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. he
slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.
