ext.   via buenos aires - mexico city - day

scene of the crime. typical mexican 'roadside shrines'
where the policemen fell. a pyre of flowers where pinta
was scooped up, creasy's blood still staining the
sidewalk alongside. a car pulls up...

rosanna guerrero gets out with a reporter and
photographer. she directs them in spanish. the reporter
starts making notes; the photographer snaps photos of the
shrine.

rosanna stands by the flower pyre. something catches her
eye. a balled-up piece of paper and a half-burned candle
beside it. as she picks it up, she spots something else.

across the street, creasy walks. an awkward hitch in his
stride. outside the apartment of the piano teacher,
surveying the scene with experienced eyes. unaware of
rosanna

creasy (flashback)

corolla.   muzzle flashes.    pinta screaming...

                             female voice
             creasy...

creasy wheels.   there's rosanna.

                          rosanna
             a lot of people are looking for you.

                          creasy
             i guess that makes you the smart one.

                          rosanna
             we're interested in the same thing.         i'm
             writing a story.

creasy walks away from her.     rosanna catches up and holds
out a plastic ziploc.

                          rosanna
             this might interest you.       i found it
             across the street.

creasy empties the contents of the ziplock into his hand.
a small ball of paper and the remains of a black candle.
creasy unballs the paper. it's a photo.

flash:   creasy at the police station.      his photo taken.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     78.


                             rosanna
               it's santa muerte. death worship. the
               religion of la hermanidad. there's a
               curse on you.

                            creasy
               it's a little late.

he hands it back to her, not interested.    as he turns to
go.

                            rosanna
               what are you going to do?

creasy doesn't answer.

                            rosanna
               i can help. i have a situation mr.
               creasy. there is a brotherhood called le
               hermanidad which protects both high
               ranking government officials, corrupt
               police, and organized crime at a level
               that is very difficult for me to touch.
               i believe you were a victim of this
               organization. you and this story may
               help to unmask them.

creasy looks carefully at rosanna.    right now he trusts
no one.

                            creasy
               thank you.

he walks away towards rayburn.
