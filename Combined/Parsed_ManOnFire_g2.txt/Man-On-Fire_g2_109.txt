int. veternarians clinic hallway - day

dogs barking constantly. manzano walks the hall flanked
by a doctor and a nurse. a second policeman, manzano's
adjutant, brings up the rear carrying two heavy binders.

                          manzano
             she's dead. they fucked with 'the
             process' and his nephew died.

                          doctor
             he suffered gunshot   wounds to the upper
             extremity, chest and   abdomen. he has a
             collapsed lung which   is stabilized,
             injured his spleen,   which we may have to
             remove and ruptured   his intestine. he's
             on strict bedrest or   there's a good
             chance we could lose   him.

                          nurse
             a strange man. he has much experience of
             hospitals.

                          manzano
             did he say so?

                           nurse
             no.   but a nurse knows.

                                                 cut to:

mugshot

manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside
the bed. the adjutant flips through one of the binders.
each page holds a single mugshot. each time creasy
shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   75.


                           manzano
            nothing?

creasy shakes his head.

                         manzano
            excellent work by the way. three men
            dead. only ten rounds fired.

creasy shakes his head at the next shot.

                         manzano
            if two of the men in my division could
            shoot like that, i could get rid of the
            other thirty-six.

one of the dogs starts to bark. another. soon ten of
them. the vet assistant enters, shouts at them to quiet.
manzano ignores it, motions the adjutant to flip pages.

                         creasy
            what am i doing here?

                         manzano
            believe it or not, you're safe here. the
            judicial police will kill you. if they
            can.
                   (re: book)
            this page?

                           creasy
            no.

the adjutant reaches the last page.   creasy shakes his
head.

                         manzano
            you have a rather checkered past. mr.
            creasy. your interpol file is six pages
            long.

                         creasy
            am i a suspect?

                          manzano
            no.   it would be convenient, but no.

as manzano packs up his mugshot books...

                         creasy
            show me mugshots of mexican policemen.
            maybe then we'll get somewhere.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     76.


                          manzano
             all these photos you just saw were of
             policemen. sadly they're protected. la
             hermanidad. the brotherhood.

manzano heads off.   as creasy watches after him...
