ext.   side yard - day

creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one
side. pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the
gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet...

...landing in a hedge.   creasy dashes over.

                           creasy
             pinta!

she's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head.
frank's licking her face.

                           pinta
             it hurts.

                           creasy
             where?

                          pinta
                    (short)
             everywhere!

she puts her hands to the left side of her ribs.     creasy
carefully probes with his fingers. she winces.

                          creasy
             i don't think they're broken.     anywhere
             else?

                           pinta
             my ankle.

as maria huffs and puffs her way up.

                          creasy
             i'm going to get you out, okay?

pinta nods. creasy eases his arms under, around her,
lifts her out as gently as possible. she disappears in
his arms.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     41.


                             pinta
             oh, creasy...

and she bursts into tears. maria looks up at the thirty
foot fall. begins to cross herself.

                            creasy
             it's okay.    she's just scared.

creasy cradles her, pats her back.      as pinta says his
name like a mantra...
