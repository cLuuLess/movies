ext.   public pool - mexico city - day

loud. chaotic. reminiscent     of a lunatic asylum. creasy
arrives at the public pool.    a practice. several
bodyguards gather at one end   of the pool. give creasy a
less than friendly look. as    he looks for pinta...

a gun goes off.

sees: the smoke from the starting pistol as the swimmers
splash into the water.

he sees pinta in the pool. the fifty yard dash. she's
in fifth. then fourth. creasy walks along beside her.
third. second and closing. and at the wall, still
second.

she surfaces, frustrated.    as she sees creasy there...
