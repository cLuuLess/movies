int.   mercedes - day

creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. pinta exuberant
beside him. traveling route number one from home base to
school. pinta looks at creasy's hands on the wheel. the
back of the right one is swirled with scars.

                          pinta
             where are you from, creasy?

                          creasy
             the united states.

                            pinta
             i know.    but which state?

creasy checks the rearview mirror. a banged up white
toyota corolla pulls out behind him.

                          creasy
             no state in particular.

pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.

                          pinta
             my mom and me are from houston, texas.
             have you been there?

creasy has his eyes on the mirror.

                            creasy
             no.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   22.


                         pinta
            you can drive and talk at the same time,
            can't you?

                         creasy
                   (turns left)
            no.

                            pinta
            why not?

                         creasy
            i'm looking for potential.

creasy checks the mirror. the white corolla continues
the way it was going. false alarm.

                            pinta
            potential?     i don't understand.

                         creasy
            places where the road bends, places away
            from buildings, places where the traffic
            thins out. but you don't have to
            understand. i do. so no talking.

                         pinta
            are you going to quit?     my last bodyguard
            quit.

                         creasy
            let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?

                         pinta
            someone gave him more money than we
            could.

                         creasy
            i'm a bargain.

                         pinta
            being black, is that a positive or
            negative for a bodyguard in mexico?

                         creasy
            time will tell.

                         pinta
            there were 24 kidnappings in mexico city
            in the last six days. four a day. what
            do you think about that, mr. creasy?

work in progress 2/10/03                                     23.


                          creasy
             pretty impressive. maybe i need to up my
             fee or get a larger gun.

she looks at his scared right hand, then him.     all
curiosity.
