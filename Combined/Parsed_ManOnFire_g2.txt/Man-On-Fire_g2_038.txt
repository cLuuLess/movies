int.   creasy's room - sunset

'chopin' drifts across the courtyard. samuel is a very
accomplished player.

creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a
glass of scotch in his hand. a knock at the door.

                            creasy
               come in.

the door opens.    it's lisa.

work in progress 2/10/03                                  29.


                         lisa
            mr. creasy, i wanted to make sure you
            have everything you need.

                           creasy
            i'm fine.

                         lisa
            is the food alright?    maria tells me that
            you didn't eat.

                         creasy
            the food's fine. sometimes i don't eat.

                         lisa
                   (smiles)
            it insults maria. slip it to the dog if
            you have to... do you mind if i talk to
            you for a moment?

he shakes his head. lisa glides into the room like a
dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.

                         lisa
            how are you getting along with pinta?

                         creasy
            we'll be okay once she realizes i'm not a
            new toy.

                         lisa
                   (smiles)
            yes, she told me.   do you have children,
            mr. creasy?

                           creasy
            no.

                         lisa
            you should know they're tenacious when
            they want something. and pinta wants to
            be friends.

                         creasy
            you're paying me to protect her, not
            amuse her. right?

a beat and then lisa nods.

                         creasy
            look. maybe this isn't going to work.
            maybe you should ask your husband to hire
            someone... more sociable.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    30.


                          lisa
             no, you're right. you were hired to
             protect her, that's enough. i'm
             confident you'll do that.

lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun
and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. it gives
her pause. something sexy about it and creasy's
proximity.

                          lisa
             i didn't realize you had a gun.    i know
             that's silly to say.

creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.

                          lisa
             it makes it all seem so serious.

                          creasy
             it is serious, mrs. ramos.

                          lisa
             please, it's lisa... i'll be coming with
             you tomorrow. i have lunch with friends.

finally, lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door.
creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.
