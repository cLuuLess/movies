int.   sitting room - ramos villa - mexico city - night

samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle
rendering of 'delibes'.     his american wife lisa stands
away from him. just the     sight of her back reveals a
pitch perfect petulance.    she tells him:

work in progress 2/10/03                                       4.


                          lisa
             a man's worth can be judged by what he
             has or what he owes. only the amount
             matters.

                          samuel
             and bankruptcy. where will that put me
             in the social strata?

                          lisa
             i'm only asking for one thing. and it's
             not an extravagance. it's not even for
             me; it's for our daughter.

                             samuel
             our daughter.

she turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts
to look at her. she stares, plays him like chinese
checkers.

                          lisa
             our child's safety is at stake.

                          samuel
                    (stops playing)
             these people are professionals. they
             don't waste their time taking children
             whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.

                          lisa
             samuel, it is not something we should
             skimp on. a bodyguard's presence in the
             car or outside the school was at least
             some form of deterrent. now he's gone, i
             feel totally exposed.

she just stares at him.    he melts.

                                                  return to:
