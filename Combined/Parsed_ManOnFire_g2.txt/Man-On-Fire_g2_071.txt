int.   mercedes - street - day

lisa sits in the backseat. through the window we can see
creasy wrap up his statement to a member of the judicial
police. finally he gets in the car, starts to drive.

work in progress 2/10/03                                      49.


                          lisa
             murdering people in the street... you
             had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?

the shoulders in front of her just shrug.

                          creasy
             nothing to do with me. or you. besides,
             there was another one in the passenger
             side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun.
             if i'd started shooting his friends, he
             would've had me. and you.

quiet a beat. lisa pulls a sliver of glass from her
hair, looks from it to creasy.

                          creasy
             a minimum close protection team consists
             of four men for high threat targets and
             environments. even in a low threat
             situation, you need two guards plus a
             security trained driver.

she shakes involuntarily. it's hitting her.      as they
make eye contact through the mirror...
