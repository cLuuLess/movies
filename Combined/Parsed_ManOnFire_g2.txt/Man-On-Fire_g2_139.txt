int. grubby kitchen room - day

the three guardians stand facing the wall. hands bound
with tape or cuffed. naked (like our 18 year old) other
than their dirty skivvies.

creasy holds up a picture of pinta.      an i.d. picture
taken from her schoolbook.

                           creasy
              tell me about the girl.

all three look...and with a strange defiant arrogance.

                           guardian one
              who the fuck's that?

boom! boom!    creasy kills guardian one.

intercut the following:

the two guardians each bound in two different rooms.
both have their eyes taped shut. creasy interrogates
guardian two.

                           creasy
              how does it work?

                           guardian two
              everything on the cellphone. we wait for
              calls. we have no number to call.

creasy picks a cell phone up off the table, hits redial.
it's a blocked line.

work in progress 2/10/03                                 92.


                             creasy
             who pays you?

                          guardian two
             we have an atm bank card. we draw out
             300 dollars every two weeks.

creasy takes the atm card from guardian two's shirt
pocket as he lies on the floor.

                          creasy
             what's the pin number?

                             guardian two
             the what?

                          creasy
             the number you use at the bank machine.

                          guardian two
             four-seven-four-seven.

                          creasy
             who killed her? you?

                             guardian two
             no!

                          creasy
             don't lie to me.

                          guardian two
             the boss did or his brother.

                          creasy
             who's the boss?

                          guardian two
             we don't know! we never see his face!
             we have to wait in the other room. he
             was screaming to the girl that...

flashback:   guardians pov.    hearing the above.

                          guardian two
             ...his nephew was killed in the exchange.
             and the money was stolen.

                             creasy
             what money?

work in progress 2/10/03                                       93.


                           guardian two
              the ransom money. at the drop. he said
              tazinari, one of the policemen had taken
              it. he was crazy.

                           creasy
              who's tazinari?

                           guardian two
              head of the antikidnapping division.

flashback: guardians pov.     see the wall shake from a
bodily impact..

boom!    creasy shoots guardian two.

guardian three (female)

becomes a panicked whirling dervish at the sound. a
moment later creasy is there. tearing the tape off her
eyes.

                            creasy
              show me.
