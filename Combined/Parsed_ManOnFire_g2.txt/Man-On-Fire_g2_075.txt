ext.   ramos pool - day

whack!   pinta bolts from the blocks.    splashes.

whack! whack! whack! pinta surges.      pinta arcs.    pinta
knifes into the water.

pinta touches the far wall of the pool, the finish line.
creasy checks his watch, claps.

                          pinta
             i'm tough, creasy.    i'm tough as you.

                          creasy
             there's no such thing as tough.    you're
             either trained or untrained.

pinta raises her arms overhead, makes like rocky across
the shallow end. creasy shakes his head in amusement.
