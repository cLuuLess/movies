int.   staircase - ramos villa - night

creasy makes his way up, enters...

pinta's bedroom

pinta in bed propped up by a pillow, teddy bear beside
her. frank at the head of the bed.

                          pinta
             the night you arrived, mom asked you if
             you had a family and you lied, didn't
             you?

                          creasy
             white lie. i didn't have a family. but
             i did have two kids. they're adults now.

it's a sensitive subject so pinta moves on.      she nods.
creasy looks at the bear. an odd beat.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     42.


                          creasy
             do you always sleep with him?

                          pinta
             i'm too old for him.     don't tell my
             friends.

                          creasy
             i don't talk to them much.     does he have
             a name?

pinta thinks just a beat, then shakes her head 'no'.
liar.

                          creasy
             i spoke to your mother.     she sends her
             love.

pinta nods. creasy stands there a beat, then heads for
the door. almost out, he looks back.

                           creasy
             some bodyguard i turned out to be.       good
             night, pinta.

he's halfway out the door.

                           pinta
             creasy?   could you play the song?

creasy is confused a moment, but when he sees her open
window, he realizes.

                           creasy
             blue bayou.   you got it.

he goes.   as pinta eases back with a sigh and a smile...
