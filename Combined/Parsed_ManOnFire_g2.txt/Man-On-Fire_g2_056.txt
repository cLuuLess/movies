ext.   ramos villa - day

a driver gets samuel's and lisa's luggage into a car.
they're on their way, kissing pinta goodbye.

                          lisa
             i'll call you from detroit, baby.

                          pinta
             you're going to miss mexican halloween.
             the day of the dead.

                          samuel
             you enjoy it for us, pinta.

lisa gives her a look. don't make this harder than it has
to be. finally, pinta nods.

creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the
mercedes. she steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last
time, then gets in back. as creasy shuts the door.
