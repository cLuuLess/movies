manzano, rosanna, and technicians are listening to voice
analysis tapes of various kidnappers. they're
struggling. rosanna hands the piece of paper with the
license plate number to manzano.

                          manzano
             he'll die of his wounds; bleed to death
             before he can do anything.

                          rosanna
             he sounded strong to me.      stronger than
             we are.

rosanna pauses.

                          rosanna
             because he's outside. because he's not
             tied to the same system we are.

                          manzano
             we did voice analysis of the last five
             high profile kidnappings, including the
             little girl. the same man 'the dreamer'.
             listen to this.

manzano plays back a recording of the kidnapper.

                          voice
             "i used to run through the streets of
             neza because i was scared of being fucked
             with. i swore one day i would cross the
             street walking. now i walk."

                          rosanna
             he's protected by la hermanidad.

                            manzano
             i know this.    your point?

                          rosanna
             creasy is not a policeman. my sense is
             he could be very valuable to us.

rosanna waits for a response.    none.

work in progress 2/10/03                                       84.


                          rosanna
             then what do you have to lose?

                          manzano
             it's a moral issue. on one hand you're
             cleaning up the bad guys, but in another
             way we are feeding the problem that
             produces bad guys.

finally deciding, manzano turns, holds out his hand.      as
rosanna hands him the paper with the partial license
written on it.,
