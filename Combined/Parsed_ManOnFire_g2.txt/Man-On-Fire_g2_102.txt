int. darkened hallway - hospital - night

creasy being wheeled down the hall by a tough plain-
clothed federal policeman. followed by rayburn, manzano,
and rosanna. the uniformed judicial police are powerless
to stop them.

                          rayburn
             what's the deal here?

                          rosanna
             i wouldn't gamble leaving him here.
             these guys will kill him in a heartbeat
             'while trying to stop him from escaping.'
