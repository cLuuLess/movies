                          lisa
             you're sure she's alright?

samuel enters from the bathroom, concern on his face.

                            lisa
             okay, good,   you're sure.
                    (to   samuel)
             he took her   for an x-ray, but it's just a
             bruise and   a sprain.

she turns her back so samuel can zip her dress up.

                          lisa
