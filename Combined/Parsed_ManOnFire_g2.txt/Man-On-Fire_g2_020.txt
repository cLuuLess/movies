ext. - juarez desert - dawn

four suv's blast along a desert highway on their way to
pick up some japanese businessmen. rayburn rides
shotgun, creasy in the back. rayburn looks like he slept
in his clothes. creasy looks crisp and clean.

                         rayburn
            that's right, a bodyguard.

creasy looks at him blankly.

                         rayburn
            your spanish is good enough.     you
            certainly look the part.

                         creasy
            you're crazy. people would hire a has-
            been, ray? a drunk?

                         rayburn
            well, you'd have to keep it under
            control.

work in progress 2/10/03                                  12.


                         creasy
            and what if, just say, there was a kidnap
            attempt?

                         rayburn
            you do your best. they won't be paying
            you enough to perform miracles.

creasy just shakes his head.

                         rayburn
            it's not exactly a scam, crease. even at
            half speed you're pretty damn good.

                          creasy
            a bodyguard has to be close to someone
            all the time. willing to talk. i'm not
            good at that.

                         rayburn
            so you'll be the silent type.    people
            will appreciate that.

creasy shakes his head, looks out the window.

                         rayburn
            what are you doing here?

                         creasy
            i came to visit you.

                         rayburn
            bullshit. i've known you fifteen years.
            you don't visit.

                         creasy
            a bodyguard... who's the guy?

                           rayburn
            samuel ramos.    owns one of the plants in
            juarez. the    jap car industry is in the
            toilet. he's    trying to persuade ford to
            partner with   him. i think he's in
            trouble. he    asked me if i knew anyone he
            could trust.

                         creasy
            oh, now you think i can be trusted.

                         rayburn
            take a job, creasy. breathe some air.
            then decide if you want to... stick
            around or not.

work in progress 2/10/03                                       13.


rayburn throws him a vhs from the glove box.

                          rayburn
             instructional tape on what i tell my
             clients about bodyguarding.

creasy looks back at rayburn who's just a little too
perceptive for comfort.
