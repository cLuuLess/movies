ext.   courtyard - pinta's school - day

pinta waiting alone. creasy's late. then the gate
swings back; the mercedes drives through. smiling, she
hurries over, hops in the passenger seat.

mercedes - rolling

                          pinta
                    (happy to see him)
             you're late.

                           creasy
             i'm sorry.

                          pinta
             you were never late before, i was
             worried.

creasy doesn't answer.    he actually looks guilty.   pinta
watches him a moment.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    50.


                          pinta
             where's my mother?

                          creasy
             i dropped her at home.

                          pinta
             it's no wonder you're late.      why didn't
             she just come with you?

creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. pinta keeps looking
at him and it suddenly all makes sense.

he looks over at her, starts to say something, then
thinks better of it. finally...

                          pinta
             do you think my mother likes you?

she's for sure pissed. definitely aware and definitely
jealous. creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.

                          creasy
             i think she's afraid of me.      but not the
             same way most people are.

pinta considers this.   then..

                          pinta
             i'm not afraid you, creasy.

                          creasy
             i know you're not.

                          pinta
             are you afraid of me?

creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.

                             creasy
             i used to be.     at first.   but not
             anymore.

her smile is huge.

                             pinta
             good.
