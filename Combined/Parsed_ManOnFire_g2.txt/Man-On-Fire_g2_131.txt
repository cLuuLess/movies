ext.   via arco iris - mexico city - day

kids playing soccer. one of them kicks an errant pass.
it skips down the street toward an approaching creasy.

the kids shout for him to kick the ball back, but he
ignores them. as the kids curse him out, creasy enters 1-
1-3...

boom up alongside the building. a man steps to a third
floor window... man two who stuffed pinta into the car.
his name is sandri. and we're inside.

sandri (italian immigrant)

putting his cufflinks through his shirt sleeves. wearing
a shoulder holster. a satisfied smile as he looks back
into the room. at the bed. a 17-year-old girl under the
sheet.

                           girl
                    (nods)
             when will i see you again?

pulling  on his suit coat, sandri steps to the door. he
mimes a  pistol action with his forefinger and thumb. he
opens it  to find himself staring square into the eyes of
creasy.   he rests the twin barrels of the sawed-off
shotgun  square against sandri's chest.

                          creasy
             her name was pinta.

sandri registers the name.   creasy swings the shotgun
down to sandri's groin.
