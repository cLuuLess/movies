int.    guardia de seguidad - sunset

as the butt of the shotgun makes contact with guardian
two's mouth. blood spouts as his front teeth are smashed
in.

as he raises his hands to his face, the pistol he holds
discharges into the ceiling. guardian one watches as
creasy clubs him again in the head.

frightened footsteps running on the other side of a
plywood wall. a female voice yelling from the other
room. creasy gauges their whereabouts.

boom!    creasy fires into the wall.    wall explodes.

guardian three freezes mid stride.      it's a tough looking
woman in her 40's.
