int.   kitchen - ramos villa - evening

gomez, maria and creasy again joined by pinta.    as creasy
places a fork of meat into his mouth...

                          pinta
             creasy, what's a concubine?

creasy opens his mouth, takes the fork of meat back out.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   44.


                         creasy
            why do you ask?

                         pinta
            it was in a book at school.   concubine.

maria and gomez wait to see how he'll answer.

                         creasy
            well, it's a sort of wife.

                         pinta
            but the emperor of china had 1000 of
            them! how can that be?

                         creasy
            in the west, it's one wife for one
            husband, but different cultures have
            different rules.

                         pinta
            it must be difficult having lots of
            wives.

                         creasy
            you feel sorry for the husband?

                         pinta
                   (in spanish)
            yeah. can you imagine my mother
            multiplied by a thousand?

maria and gomez burst out laughing. so funny that creasy
smiles. pinta lights up at the sight. a huge victory.

                         pinta
            creasy, you're smiling.

he reverts to a frown. now pinta bursts out laughing.
and creasy can't help but smile again.

                            creasy
            i guess i am.

pinta changes subject.

                         pinta
            so how come you know so much about those
            countries?

                         creasy
            i had to do my homework on them when i
            worked there. also i enjoy history.

work in progress 2/10/03                                  45.


                          pinta
             what did you do in asia? is that where
             you met the man with cigarettes?

                          creasy
             no, that was in columbia.

                                                cut to:

gomez

humming to himself as he brushes the leaves out of the
empty swimming pool.

                                                cut to:

cu of a water faucet unloads 100 gallons a minute.

a man's hand.   black.

raises up against the blue sky. like a kid playing
cowboys and indians. the finger pulls an imaginary
trigger.

ramos pool

in her swimsuit and cap, pinta crouches in makeshift
starting blocks.

                            creasy
             bang!

pinta takes off. splashes into the water.     not to
creasy's satisfaction.

                          creasy
             no, no, come back.

pinta turns in the water, looks back at him.

                          creasy
             you don't flinch when a gun goes off; you
             react. you go. don't listen for the
             sound; don't anticipate it. concentrate
             on the sound itself.

                          pinta
             i don't understand.

                            creasy
             don't worry.    you will.

creasy points at the blocks.    pinta gets out of the
water.

work in progress 2/10/03                                  46.


shivering, creasy throws a towel around her and
rubs her down.
