int.   ago's - mexico city - day

samuel valencia ramos and his lawyer jordan kalfus in the
privacy of an alcove table. jordan is well heeled, well
connected and well oiled. in that order. samuel, at 40,
already has the patrician look that has served the male
members of his family for generations. they discuss the
kidnapping, a headline on the paper jordan tosses aside.

                          jordan
             the family paid the ransom and he was
             returned two days later.
                    (laughs; chews)
             his father still hasn't gotten up the
             nerve to ask him if they fucked him up
             the ass.

                          samuel
             and now every mother with money in mexico
             city wants bigger and better bodyguards.
             my own wife included.

                          jordan
             if she pisses you off, you get another one.

                          samuel
                    (laughs grimly)
             do you know what she told me last night?
