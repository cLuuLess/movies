int.   mercedes - day

creasy at the wheel.    samuel sits in the back.   studying.

                          samuel
             you drive easily. smoothly.

creasy doesn't answer, just drives.

                          samuel (cont'd)
             were you provided with a gun?

                             creasy
             yes.

                          samuel
             show me, please.

creasy takes his right hand off the wheel, reaches under
his jacket and passes back a beat-to-shit looking pistol.

                             samuel (cont'd)
             what is it?

                          creasy
             nine millimeter. a sig sauer 226.

                          samuel
             have you used this type before?

creasy just nods.   doesn't like the show and tell.

                             samuel
             is it loaded?

                             creasy
             it's loaded.

samuel hands back the gun.

work in progress 2/10/03                                   14.


                          samuel
             you will meet my wife first. she would
             like it if you are presentable, polite
             and respectful. you'll be the fifth
             candidate she's seen this week.

samuel flips through a manila folder.

                          samuel
             your resume is impressive. nine years in
             the army. extensive counter terrorism
             work. i shouldn't be able to afford you
             in my current state. what's the catch?

                          creasy
                    (honest)
             i drink.

                          samuel
             how does it affect you?

                          creasy
             my coordination. reaction time. if top
             professionals try to kidnap your
             daughter, the service will be on par with
             the pay.

                          samuel
             and what if amateurs try it?

                          creasy
             i'll probably kill them.   is that likely?

                          samuel
             no. and no one is to know of your
             drinking problem. that includes my wife.

as they pull up to the ramos' impressive hacienda.
