ext. ramos villa- day

the sounds of samuel's baby grand resonates throughout
the villa. an impassioned rendering of a mozart
symphony.

pinta is looking for frank. today is saturday and on
weekends frank is allowed to travel with them. and today
she is claiming all her rights.

                           pinta
             frank.   frankie.

pinta whistles.

                          creasy
             pinta, we've got to go.   travel sucks at
             this time.

                           pinta
             frank.   frankie.
