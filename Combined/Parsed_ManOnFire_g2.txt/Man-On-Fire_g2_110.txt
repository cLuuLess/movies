int.   dog pens - night

creasy sitting on the gurney, rayburn buttons his shirt.

                           rayburn
                     (whispers)
             okay?

creasy nods. rayburn gets creasy's arm over his
shoulder, eases him off the gurney till his feet hit the
floor.

creasy winces, but the two of them start to walk out.
