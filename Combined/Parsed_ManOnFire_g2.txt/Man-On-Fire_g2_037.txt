int.   kitchen - ramos villa - day

creasy sits at the table   with the old gardener gomez
(we've seen him trimming   hedges and such in earlier
exteriors). gomez's just    cleaned his plate and is going
after any remnants with a   crust of bread. creasy hasn't
touched his.

maria, the cook, enters.    as she clocks creasy's plate...
