ext.   public building - day

creasy watches and waits.    time lapse of the building

jorge exits the building still trying to get the last
button of his police uniform closed. he's a cop. he
struggles to get behind the wheel of the fiat. the car
is tiny.

someone's getting in on the passenger side.

as jorge starts to protest, creasy rams a sig into his
gut. at the same time, he takes jorge's gun from its
holster.

                            creasy
             drive.

                          jorge
                    (incredulous)
             do you know who i am?

                          creasy
             you are jorge ramirez.

creasy jams him in the gut again.

jorge starts the engine.    as he eases out into traffic.
