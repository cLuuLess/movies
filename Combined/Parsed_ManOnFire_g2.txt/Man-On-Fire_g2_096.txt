int.   stairwell door - hospital - day

it opens and out slides rayburn. he looks down the
hallway. press conference is still going down that way.
rayburn heads the other way.

but as he tries to enter creasy's room, he's met in the
door by two thug cops, in uniform.

                             cop one
             no visitors.

cop two pokes a finger into rayburn's chest.

                             cop two
             who are you?

                          rayburn
             i'm here to see my friend.

cop two pokes him again.     goading him.

                          cop two
             identification.

work in progress 2/10/03                                     69.


rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his
wallet. suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. manzano
is on the way down followed by adjutant and two
plainclothes.

ignoring the proffered salutes, manzano finishes his
pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards rayburn.

                          manzano
             when i heard it was this hospital i was
             so pleased. there's a pastry shop
             nearby. delgado's. do you know it?

rayburn shakes his head.

                          manzano
             the best pastries in mexico.

manzano holds out his right hand.

                          manzano (cont'd)
             miguel manzano.
