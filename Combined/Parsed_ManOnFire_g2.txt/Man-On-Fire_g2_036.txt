int.   mercedes - rolling -day

pinta rides shotgun alongside creasy.     she looks out the
window, realizes...

                          pinta
             we're taking a different way home.

                             creasy
             that's right.

pinta thinks about it, realizes what he's doing, smiles.

                             pinta
             i understand.     smart.

no answer from creasy.     it's hard not to feel foolish
around this kid.

                          pinta
             did you like school, creasy?

                             creasy
             no.

                             pinta
             not at all?

                             creasy
             no.

                             pinta
             but why not?

creasy's hoping she'll just shut up.

work in progress 2/10/03                                    27.


                              pinta
              hmmm?

                           creasy
              it wasn't a school like yours and there
              was no sister anna.

                           pinta
              so you were unhappy?

                           creasy
              being unhappy is a state of mind.   i
              never thought about it.

                              pinta
              oh...

pinta watches creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in.
she looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel.

then, as she reaches out...

                           pinta
              what happened to...

and touches it.

                              pinta
              ...your hand?

creasy gives her a look, devoid of humanity for an
instant.

                           creasy
              no more questions.

when he speaks again he's colder; he's decided something.

                           creasy
              i'm not paid to be your friend.   i'm paid
              to protect you.

they drive on in silence. creasy finally glances over.
pinta stares straight ahead, her chin quivering.

                           creasy
                     (exasperated)
              and don't start crying.

                           pinta
              i'm not crying.

but she is.   as creasy stops at a red light...

work in progress 2/10/03                                      28.


                            creasy
               look, this is the way i am.   i don't like
               questions. i --

and she's out the door.

                            creasy
               shit.

creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.

intersection

creasy has barely straightened himself and pinta is
already getting back in the car. this time in the
backseat.

creasy sighs. the light goes green.     scooters whine away
and horns blare.

mercedes

creasy sits back behind the wheel.

                            pinta
               you can take me home now, mr. creasy.

creasy looks back at her, but she stares straight ahead.
as the chorus of horns continues, creasy continues driving.
