int.   lisa & samuel's bedroom - night

spent, glistened in sweat, the couple lay side by side.

                           lisa
              she likes him.

                            samuel
              hmm?

lisa just smiles, knows her daughter better.

                                                 cut to:

creasy's room

creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window,
listening to the sounds of mexico city at night.

the empty scotch glass is set down.    ominously sober.
