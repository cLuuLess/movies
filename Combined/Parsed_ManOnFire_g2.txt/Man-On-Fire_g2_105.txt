int.   veterinarian's clinic - mexico city - day

cages of mangy looking mutts. pull back to reveal creasy
on his hospital bed, ivs and all.

rayburn sits nearby. he looks up as creasy stirs, wakes
again. creasy's eyes flicker to his friend, ask the
first question on his mind. pinta...

rayburn looks away, can't face his friend.   and suddenly,
creasy knows.

                           creasy
             she's dead.   isn't she?

rayburn finally nods. and with that gesture, god takes
everything away. it might as well be the old testament.
and we are about to get biblical.

creasy turns his head, looks up at the ceiling.

                          rayburn
             it was a fuck up. someone hijacked the
             drop. the kidnapper, his nephew got
             killed.

cu of creasy's face with his back to the room.     a
thousand yard stare. his eyes glaze over.
