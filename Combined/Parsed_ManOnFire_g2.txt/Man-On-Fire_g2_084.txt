int.   traditional restaurant - mexico city - night

a mariachi band roams. we see creasy but not who he's
with. a date? as we come around it's pinta. sitting
with them, rayburn and his wife. and a sleeping four-
year-old.

note: rethink following dialogue with reference to
creasy / rayburn background.

                          pinta
             my dad said all your friends were dead.

                          rayburn
             all but one. the most important one.
             when we were eighteen, we made an
             agreement to "take the world" together.

                          creasy
             then one day, he calls and says, 'i'm in
             love and i'm moving to mexico.' i said
             what happened to the plan?

                         rayburn
            i said the plan was right here.

rayburn looks at beautiful 19-year-old alicia and their
four-year-old son sleeping.

                         creasy
            i hung up on him. when i met alicia, i
            got it.

alicia blows creasy a kiss.

                         creasy
            can i kiss her now, or after you've gone
            to bed?

laughter.

                         pinta
            okay, i think now is as good as time as
            any.

she takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. she holds
it out to creasy. he looks at her, takes it from her
hand. his thick fingers fumble with a delicate
drawstring.

pinta waits for his reaction as creasy pours a simple,
but fine medallion and chain into the palm of his hand.

                         pinta
            i bought it with my own money.     i saved
            it.

creasy is really affected, tries to hide it.    she takes
it, slips it over his head.

                         pinta
            it's st. jude, the patron saint of lost
            causes.

                         rayburn
            and hard cases. creasy's the reason st.
            jude became a saint in the first place.

                         pinta
            yeah, that's right.

creasy looks at it, considers.

                         creasy
            thank you, pinta, it's beautiful.

work in progress 2/10/03                                  57.


pinta kisses him. as the mariachi band drifts over,
rayburn grabs his wife by the hand.

                          rayburn
             come on, baby. i feel like a third
             wheel. watch the kid.

they dance. a waiter steps over, refills creasy's water
glass. as he drinks...

                          pinta
             could i ask you a question?

                          creasy
             could i stop you?

                          pinta
             you don't drink like you used to.

                          creasy
             that's not a question.

                          pinta
             i know because i go in your room and
             check the bottles.

                          creasy
             still not a question.

                          pinta
             my mom drinks, too...    why do people
             drink, creasy?

                          creasy
             now that's a question. i don't know
             about your mom. for me, the problem
             isn't in the glass. the problem's in
             between my ears.

                          pinta
             you think too much?

                           creasy
             yeah. because at one time, i didn't
             think enough.

pinta nods, thinks she understands.
