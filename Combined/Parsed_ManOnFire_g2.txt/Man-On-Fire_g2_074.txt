heated. steam rising off the water. pinta stands with
her eyes closed. creasy, standing beside her, brings two
blocks together with a whack!

work in progress 2/10/03                                       51.


pinta flinches at the sound. she opens her eyes, shrugs
an apology at him. creasy frowns, shakes his head.
pinta closes her eyes again. he starts walking around
her. frank oversees the whole program.

                          creasy
             the gunshot holds no fear.    say it.

                          pinta
             the gunshot holds no fear.

                          creasy
             you welcome the sound. the sound is what
             lets you go. the sound is what frees
             you. you are a prisoner in those blocks
             until you hear the sound.

eyes closed, she's drifted off with his voice. and
creasy whacks them together right in front of her face.

pinta smiles at the sound.     creasy smiles at the sight.
