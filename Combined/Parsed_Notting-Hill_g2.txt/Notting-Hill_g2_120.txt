  ext. london street - day

  the car speeds through london.  it gets totally stuck at a
  junction where no one will let them in.

        spike
    bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

  he gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
  opposite direction.  our car shoots past him.

        spike
    go!

  they leave him behind.  honey leans out the window and shouts...

        honey
    you're my hero.

  spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
  hit by a car.
