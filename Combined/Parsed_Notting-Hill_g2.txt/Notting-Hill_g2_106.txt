  int. tony's restaurant - night

  bella bangs a spoon on a wine bottle.  all the friends are
  gathered in the restaurant.

        bella
    i have a little speech to make -- i won't
    stand up because i can't... be bothered.
    exactly a year ago today, this man here
    started the finest restaurant in london.

        tony
    thank you very much.

        bella
    unfortunately -- no one ever came to eat
    here.

        tony
    a tiny hiccough.

        bella
    and so we must face the fact that from
    next week, we have to find somewhere
    near to eat.

  tony's brave face breaks.  the dream is over.

        bella
    i just want to say to tony -- don't take
    it personally.  the more i think about
    things, the more i see no rhyme or reason
    in life -- no one knows why some things
    work out, and some things don't -- why
    some of us get lucky -- and some of us...

        bernie
    ... get fired.

        bella
    no!

        bernie
    yes, they're shifting the whole outfit
    much more towards the trading side --
    and of course...
      (he owns up)
    i was total crap.

  they're all rather stunned.

        tony
    so we go down together!  a toast to
    bernie -- the worst stockbroker in the
    whole world!

  they toast him.

        honey
    since it's an evening of announcements
    ... i've also got one, ahm... i've
    decided to get engaged.

  total bewilderment from the others.

        honey
    i've found myself a nice, slightly odd
    looking bloke who i know is going to
    make me happy for the rest of my life.

  special cut to bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings
  for honey.

        william
    wait a minute -- i'm your brother and i
    don't know anything about this.

        max
    is it someone we know?

        honey
    yes.  i will keep you informed.

  as she sits down, honey leans towards spike and whispers.

        honey
    by the way -- it's you.

        spike
    me?

        honey
    yes.  what do you think?

        spike
    well, yes.  groovy.

        max
    any more announcements?

        william
    yes -- i feel i must apologize to
    everyone for my behavior for the last
    six months.  i have, as you know, been
    slightly down in the mouth.

        max
    there's an understatement.  there are
    dead people on better form.

        william
    but i wish to make it clear i've turned
    a corner and henceforward intend to be
    impressively happy.
