  anna and william at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
  crowd.

  honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.

  nearby, tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
  pyramidical wedding cake.

  william's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  she
  tries to brush his hair.

  max, dressed in the most devastating bond-like white tuxedo is
  dancing with anna -- thrilled.  he does a rather flashy little
  move.  cut to bella who is watching and laughing.

  martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
  song, entirely happy in the corner.
