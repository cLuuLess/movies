  int. restaurant - night

  a very smart japanese restaurant.  we see anna and william
  sitting, near the end of their meal.

        anna
    so who left who?

        william
    she left me.

        anna
    why?

        william
    she saw through me.

        anna
    uh-oh.  that's not good.

  we've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table --
  now we can hear it.  two slightly rowdy men.

        lawrence
    no - no- no!  give me anna scott any
    day.

  william and anna look at each other.

        gerald
    i didn't like that last film of hers.
    fast asleep from the moment the
    lights went down.

  again -- anna reacts.

        lawrence
    don't really care what the films are
    like.  any film with her in it --
    fine by me.

        gerald
    no -- not my type at all really.  i
    prefer that other one -- blonde --
    sweet looking -- has an orgasm every
    time you take her out for a cup of
    coffee.

  anna mouths 'meg ryan.'

        lawrence
    meg ryan.

  william and anna smile -- they're enjoying it.

        gerald
    drug-induced, i hear -- i believe
    she's actually in rehab as we speak.

        lawrence
    whatever, she's so clearly up for it.

  anna's twinkle fades.

        lawrence
    you know -- some girls, they're all
    'stay away chum' but anna, she's
    absolutely gagging for it.  do you
    know that in over fifty percent of
    languages the word for "actress" is
    the same as the word for "prostitute."

  this is horrible.

        lawrence
    and anna is your definitive actress
    -- someone really filthy you can just
    flip over...

        william
    right, that's it.

  he gets up and goes round the corner to the men.  there are in
  fact four of them, the two meeker men, gavin and harry, hanging
  on the other guys' witty words.

        william
    i'm sorry to disturb you guys but --

        lawrence
    can i help you?

        william
    well, yes, i wish i hadn't overheard
    your conversation -- but i did and i
    just think, you know...

  he's not a very convincing or frightening figure.

        william
    ...the person you're talking about
    is a real person and i think she
    probably deserves a little bit more
    consideration, rather than having
    jerks like you drooling over her...

        lawrence
    oh sod off, mate.  what are you, her
    dad?

  anna suddenly appears at his side and whips him away without
  being recognized.

        william
    i'm sorry.

        anna
    no, that's fine.  i love that you
    tried... time was i'd have done the
    same.

  they walk on and then...

        anna
    in fact -- give me a second.

  and she walks straight back to their table.

        anna
    hi.

        lawrence
    oh my god...

        anna
    i'm sorry about my friend -- he's
    very sensitive.

        lawrence
    no, look, i'm sorry...

        anna
    please, please -- let's just leave
    it there.  i'm sure you meant no harm,
    and i'm sure it was just friendly
    banter and i'm sure you dicks are all
    the size of peanuts.  a perfect match
    for the size of your brains.  enjoy
    your meal.  the tuna's really good.

  and she walks away.  gerald turns to lawrence.

        gerald
    you prick.
