  int. william's dining room

  anna and william.  sat down at table.  there's a picture
  hanging on the wall behind.

        anna
    i can't believe you have that picture
    on your wall.

  it is a poster of a chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,
  with a goat as company.

        william
    you like chagall?

        anna
    i do.  it feels like how being in love
    should be.  floating through a dark
    blue sky.

        william
    with a goat playing a violin.

        anna
    yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness
    without a violin-playing goat.

  spike enters with three pizzas.

    voila.  carnival calypso, for the
    queen of notting hill -- pepperoni,
    pineapple and a little more
    pepperoni.

        anna
    fantastic.

        william
    i don't mention that anna's a
    vegetarian, did i?

        spike
      (pause)
    i have some parsnip stew from last week.
    if i just peel the skin off, it'll be
    perfect.
