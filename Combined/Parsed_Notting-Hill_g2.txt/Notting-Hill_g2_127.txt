  ext. garden - day

  a pretty green communal garden.  children are playing, watched
  by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  a very
  old couple wander along slowly.

  a small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  and as the camera
  glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
  bench overlooking the garden.  he is reading, she is just
  looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  it
  is william and anna.
