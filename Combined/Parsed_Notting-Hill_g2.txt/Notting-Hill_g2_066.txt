  int. william's living room - evening

  william is looking out the window, lost in thought.  spike
  enters.

        spike
    come on -- open up -- this is me --
    spikey -- i'm in contact with some
    quite important spiritual vibrations.
    what's wrong?

  spike settles on the arm of a chair.  william decides to open
  up a bit...

        william
    well, okay.  there's this girl...

        spike
    aha!  i'd been getting a female vibe.
    good.  speak on, dear friend.

        william
    she's someone i just can't -- someone
    who... self-evidently can't be mine --
    and it's as if i've taken love-heroin
    -- and now i can't even have it again.
    i've opened pandora's box.  and there's
    trouble inside.

  spike nods thoughtfully.

        spike
    yeh.  yeh... tricky... tricky... i
    knew a girl at school called pandora
    ... never got to see her box though.

  he roars with laughter.  william smiles.

        william
    thanks.  yes -- very helpful.
