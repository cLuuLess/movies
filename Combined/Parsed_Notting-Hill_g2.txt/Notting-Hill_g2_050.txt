    i'm delighted.

  he holds out his hand to shake.  she kisses him on the cheek.
  he stumbles back with joy.

        anna
    and may i say that's a gorgeous tie.

        max
    now you're lying.

        anna
    you're right.  i told you i was bad
    at acting.

  max loves this.

        anna

    lovely to meet you.

        bella

    before i tell him you're a
    vegetarian.

        max

        anna
    night, night, honey.

        honey
    i'm so sorry about the loo thing.
    i meant to leave but i just...
    look, ring me if you need someone to
    go shopping with.  i know lots of
    nice, cheap places... not that money
    necessarily...
      (gives up)
    nice to meet you.

  and honey gives her a huge hug.

        anna
    you too -- from now on you are my
    style guru.

  anna and william head out... bernie tries to save some dignity.

        bernie

  they move to the door and wave goodbye.
