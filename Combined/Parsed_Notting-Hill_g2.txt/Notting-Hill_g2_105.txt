  int. bookshop - day

  a grey day in the bookshop.  martin and william.  as ever.  a
  feeling that things in there ever change.

  ten seconds pass.  honey rushes in.  spike, still feeling in
  disgrace, comes in with her but lingers in the doorway.

        honey
    have we got something for you.
    something which will make you love me so
    much you'll want to hug me every single
    day for the rest of my life.

        william
    blimey.  what's that?

        honey
    the phone number of anna scott's agent
    in london and her agent in new york.
    you can ring her.  you think about her
    all the time -- now you can ring her!

        william
    well, thanks, that's great.

        honey
    it is great, isn't it.  see you tonight.
    hey, marty-- sexy cardy.

  and she rushes out.  william looks at the piece of paper, folds
  it and then places it gently in the garbage bin.
