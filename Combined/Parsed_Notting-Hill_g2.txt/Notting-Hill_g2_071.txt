  int. max and bella's corridor - night

  william is with rosie by the door -- just about to say goodbye.

        rosie
    maybe we'll meet again some time.

        william
    yes.  that would be... great.

  she kisses him gently on the cheek.  he opens the door -- she
  walks out.  he shuts the door quietly and heads back into the
  living room...
