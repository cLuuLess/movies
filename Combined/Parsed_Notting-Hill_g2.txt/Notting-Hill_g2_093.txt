  int. william's bedroom - night

  the middle of the night.  they are both asleep -- a yard apart.
  in sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then
  she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right
  next to him.  he is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this
  all is.
