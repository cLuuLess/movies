  int. william's upstairs corridor - night

  they are walking up the stairs -- and stop at the top.

        anna
    today has ben a good day.  which under
    the circumstances is... unexpected.

        william
    well, thank you.
      (awkward pause)
    anyway -- time for bed.  or...
    sofa-bed.

        anna
    right.

  pause.  she leans forward, kisses him gently, then steps into
  the bedroom and closes the door.
