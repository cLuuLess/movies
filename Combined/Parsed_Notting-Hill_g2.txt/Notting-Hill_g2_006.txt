    then suddenly it's the weekend, and
    from break of day, hundreds of stalls
    appears out of nowhere, filling
    portobello road right up to notting
    hill gate...

  a frantic crowded portobello market.

        william (v.o.)
    ... and thousands of people buy
    millions of antiques, some genuine...

  the camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
  glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
  and saints.

        william (v.o.)
    ... and some not so genuine.
