  ext. william's terrace - day

  the two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
  william is reading 'the bookseller.'  the terrace is small and
  the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks london in a rather
  wonderful way.  spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.

        spike
    there's something wrong with the
    goggles though...

        william
    no, they were prescription, so i could
    see all the fishes properly.

        spike
    groovy.  you should do more of this
    stuff.

        william
    so -- any messages?

        spike
    yeh, i wrote a couple down.

        william
    two?  that's it?

        spike
    you want me to write down all your
    messages?

  william closes his eyes in exasperation.

        william
    who were the ones you didn't write
    down from?

        spike
    ahm let's see -- ahm.  no.  gone
    completely.  oh no, wait.  there was --
    one from your mum: she said don't
    forget lunch and her leg's hurting
    again.

        william
    right.  no one else?

        spike
    absolutely not.

  spike leans back and relaxes.

        spike
    though if we're going for this
    obsessive writing-down-all-messages
    thing -- some american girl called
    anna called a few days ago.

  william freezes -- then looks at spike.

        william
    what did she say?

        spike
    well, it was genuinely bizarre...
    she said, hi -- it's anna -- and then
    she said, call me at the ritz -- and
    then gave herself a completely
    different name.

        william
    which was?

        spike
    absolutely no idea.  remembering one
    name's bad enough...
