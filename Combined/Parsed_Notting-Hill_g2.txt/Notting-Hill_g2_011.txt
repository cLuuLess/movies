  int. the bookshop - day

  it is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
  with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
  martin, william's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
  he is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  perhaps without
  cause.  a few seconds later, william stands gloomily behind the
  desk.

        william
    classic.  absolutely classic.
    profit from major sales push -- minus
    $b!r(j347.

        martin
    shall i go get a cappuccino?  ease the
    pain.

        william
    yes, better get me a half.  all i can
    afford.

        marin
    i get your logic.  demi-capu coming up.

  he salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
  we only just glimpse her.

  cut to william working.  he looks up casually.  and sees
  something.  his reaction is hard to read.  after a pause...

        william
    can i help you?

  it is anna scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
  in his shop.  the most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
  when she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.

        anna
    no, thanks.  i'll just look around.

        william
    fine.

  she wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
  quite smart coffee table book.

        william
    that book's really not good -- just
    in case, you know, browsing turned to
    buying.  you'd be wasting your money.

        anna
    really?

        william
    yes.  this one though is... very
    good.

  he picks up a book on the counter.

        william
    i think the man who wrote it has
    actually been to turkey, which helps.
    there's also a very amusing incident
    with a kebab.

        anna
    thanks.  i'll think about it.

  william suddenly spies something odd on the small tv monitor
  beside him.

        william
    if you could just give me a second.

  her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
  approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.

        william
    excuse me.

        thief
    yes.

        william
    bad news.

        thief
    what?

        william
    we've got a security camera in this
    bit of the shop.

        thief
    so?

        william
    so, i saw you put that book down your
    trousers.

        thief
    what book?

        william
    the one down your trousers.

        thief
    i haven't got a book down my trousers.

        william
    right -- well, then we have something
    of an impasse.  i tell you what --
    i'll call the police -- and,  what can
    i say? -- if i'm wrong about the whole
    book-down-the-trousers scenario, i
    really apologize.

        thief
    okay -- what if i did have a book down
    my trousers?

        william
    well, ideally, when i went back to
    the desk, you'd remove the cadogan
    guide to bali from your trousers, and
    either wipe it and put it back, or
    buy it.  see you in a sec.

  he returns to his desk.  in the monitor we just glimpse, as does
  william, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
  shelves.  the thief drifts out towards the door.  anna, who has
  observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.

        william
    sorry about that...

        anna
    no, that's fine.  i was going to
    steal one myself but now i've changed
    my mind.  signed by the author, i see.

        william
    yes, we couldn't stop him.  if you
    can find an unsigned copy, it's
    worth an absolute fortune.

  she smiles.  suddenly the thief is there.

        thief
    excuse me.

        anna
    yes.

        thief
    can i have your autograph?

        anna
    what's your name?

        thief
    rufus.

  she signs his scruffy piece of paper.  he tries to read it.

        thief
    what does it say?

        anna
    well, that's the signature -- and
    above, it says 'dear rufus -- you
    belong in jail.'

        thief
    nice one.  would you like my phone
    number?

        anna
    tempting but... no, thank you.

  thief leaves.

        anna
    i think i will try this one.

  she hands william a $b!r(j20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
  he talks as he handles the transaction.

        william
    oh -- right -- on second thoughts
    maybe it wasn't that bad.  actually
    -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
    none of those childish kebab
    stories you get in so many travel
    books these days.  and i'll throw in
    one of these for free.

  he drops in one of the signed books.

        william
    very useful for lighting fires,
    wrapping fish, that sort of things.

  she looks at him with a slight smile.

        anna
    thanks.

  and leaves.  she's out of his life forever.  william is a little
  dazed.  seconds later martin comes back in.

        martin
    cappuccino as ordered.

        william
    thanks.  i don't think you'll believe
    who was just in here.

        martin
    who?  someone famous?

  but william's innate natural english discretion takes over.

        william
    no. no-one -- no-one.

  they set about drinking their coffees.

        martin
    would be exciting if someone famous
    did come into the shop though,
    wouldn't it?  do you know -- this is
    pretty incredible actually -- i once
    saw ringo starr.  or at least i think
    it was ringo.  it might have been
    that broke from 'fiddler on the roof,'
    toppy.

        william
    topol.

        martin
    that's right -- topol.

        william
    but ringo starr doesn't look
    anything like topol.

        martin
    no, well... he was quite a long way
    away.

        william
    so it could have been neither of them?

        martin
    i suppose so.

        william
    right.  it's not a classic anecdotes,
    is it?

        martin
    not classic, no.

  martin shakes his head.  william drains his cappuccino.


        william
    right -- want another one?

        martin
    yes.  no, wait -- let's go crazy --
    i'll have an orange juice.
