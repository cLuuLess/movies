  int. william's living room - night

  later in the evening.  william and anna on their own.  they're
  sipping coffee.  a few seconds of just co-existing.  anna looks
  up.

        anna
    you've got big feet.

        william
    yes.  always have had.

        anna
    you know what they say about men with
    big feet?

        william
    no.  what's that?

        anna
    big feet -- large shoes.

  he laughs.
