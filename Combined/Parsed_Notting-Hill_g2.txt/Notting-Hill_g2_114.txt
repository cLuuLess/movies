  int. backroom of the bookshop - day

  the next day.  william is hard at work, doing the accounts in a
  dark small room with files in it.  martin pops his head in.

        martin
    i have to disturb you when you're
    cooking the books, but there's a
    delivery.

        william
    martin, can't you just deal with this
    yourself?

        martin
    but it's not for the shop.  it's for you.

        william
    okay.  tell me, would i have to pay a wet
    rag as much as i pay you?

  they head out, martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing
  his hands -- he's in a very good mood.
