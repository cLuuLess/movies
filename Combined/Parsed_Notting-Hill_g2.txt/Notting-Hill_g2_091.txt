  int. william's living room - night

  william downstairs -- on a sofa -- under a duvet.  eyes open.
  thinking.  pause and pause.

  he waits and waits -- the ultimate 'yearn.'  but nothing
  happens.  william gets off the sofa decisively.  sits on the
  side of it.  then gets back in again.

  pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  there's
  someone there.

        william
      (to himself)
    oh my god...
      (then...)
    hello.

        spike
    hello.  i wonder if i could have a
    little word.

  he drifts round the corner, half-naked.

        william
    spike.

        spike
    i don't want to interfere, or anything
    ... but she's split up from her boy-
    friend, that's right isn't it?

        william
    maybe.

        spike
    and she's in your house.

        william
    yes.

        spike
    and you get on very well.

        william
    yes.

        spike
    well, isn't this perhaps a good
    opportunity to... slip her one?

        william
    spike.  for god's sake -- she's in
    trouble -- get a grip.

        spike
    right.  right.  you think it's the
    wrong moment.  fair enough.
      (pause)
    do you mind if i have a go?

        william
    spike!

        spike
    no -- you're right.

        william
    i'll talk to you in the morning.

        spike
    okay -- okay.  might be too late, but
    okay.

  back to william thinking again.  dreamy atmosphere.  and then...
  more footsteps on the stairs.

        william
    oh please sod off.

        anna
    okay.

        william
    no! no.  wait.  i... thought you were
    someone else.  i thought you were spike.
    i'm delighted you're not.

  the darkness of the living room.  we see anna in the shadow.
