  int. bookshop - day

  william enters -- and there stands anna -- in a simple blue
  skirt and top.

        anna
    hi.

        william
    hello.

        anna
    you disappeared.

        william
    yes -- i'm sorry -- i had to leave... i
    didn't want to disturb you.

        anna
    well... how have you been?

        william
    fine.  everything much the same.  when
    they change the law spike and i will
    marry immediately.  whereas you...
    i've watched in wonder.  awards, glory
    ...

        anna
    oh no.  it's all nonsense, believe me.
    i had no idea how much nonsense it all
    was -- but nonsense it all is...
      (she's nervous)
    well, yesterday was our last day
    filming and so i'm just off -- but i
    brought you this from home, and...

  it's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot,
  leaning against a bookshelf.

        anna
    i thought i'd give it to you.

        william
    thank you.  shall i...

        anna
    no, don't open it yet -- i'll be
    embarrassed.

        william
    okay -- well, thank you.  i don't know
    what it's for.  but thank you anyway.

        anna
    i actually had it in my apartment in new
    york and just thought you'd... but,
    when it came to it, i didn't know how to
    call you... having behaved so... badly,
    twice.  so it's been just sitting in the
    hotel.  but then... you came, so i
    figured... the thing is... the thing is
    ...

        william
    what's the thing?

  then the door pings.  in walks the annoying customer, mr. smith.

        william
    don't even think about it.  go away
    immediately.

  mr. smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.

        mr. smith
    right.  sorry.

  and he leaves.

        william
    you were saying...

        anna
    yes.  the thing is... i have to go away
    today but i wondered, if i didn't,
    whether you might let me see you a bit...
    or, a lot maybe... see if you could...
    like me again.

  pause as william takes this in.

        william
    but yesterday... that actor asked you
    who i was... and you just dismissed me
    out of hand... i heard -- you had a
    microphone... i had headphones.

        anna
    you expect me to tell the truth about my
    life to the most indiscreet man in
    england?

  martin edges up.

        martin
    excuse me -- it's your mother on the
    phone.

        william
    can you tell her i'll ring her back.

        martin
    i actually tried that tack -- but she
    said you said that before and it's been
    twenty-four hours, and her foot that
    was purple is now a sort of blackish
    color...

        william
    okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold
    the fort for a second will you, martin?

  martin is left with anna.

        martin
    can i just say, i thought 'ghost' was a
    wonderful film.

        anna
    is that right?

        martin
    yes... i've always wondered what
    patrick swayze is like in real life.

        anna
    i can't say i know patrick all that
    well.

        martin
    oh dear.  he wasn't friendly during the
    filming?

        anna
    well, no -- i'm sure he was friendly --
    to demi moore -- who acted with him in
    'ghost.'

  she's kind in here, not sarcastic.

        martin
    oh right.  right.  sorry.  always been
    a bit of an ass.

  william returns a little uneasy.

        martin
    anyway... it's lovely to meet you.  i'm
    a great fan of yours.  and demi's, of
    course.

  martin leaves them.

        william
    sorry about that.

        anna
    that's fine.  there's always a pause
    when the jury goes out to consider its
    verdict.

  she's awaiting an answer.

        william
    anna.  look -- i'm a fairly level-
    headed bloke.  not often in and out of
    love.  but...

  he can't really express what he feels.

        william
    ... can i just say 'no' to your kind
    request and leave it at that?

        anna
    ... yes, that's fine.  of course.  i...
    you know... of course... i'll just...
    be getting along then... nice to see
    you.

        william
    the truth is...

  he feels he must explain.

        william
    ... with you, i'm in real danger.  it
    took like a perfect situation, apart
    from that foul temper of yours -- but my
    relatively inexperienced heart would,
    i fear, not recover if i was once again
    ... cast aside, which i would
    absolutely expect to be.  there are too
    many pictures of you everywhere, too
    many films.  you'd go and i'd be...
    well, buggered, basically.

        anna
    i see.
      (pause)
    that reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?

        william
    i live in notting hill.  you live in
    beverly hills.  everyone in the world
    knows who you are.  my mother has
    trouble remembering my name.

        anna
    okay.  fine.  fine.  good decision.

  pause.

        anna
    the fame thing isn't really real, you
    know.  don't forget -- i'm also just a
    girl.  standing in front of a boy.
    asking him to love her.

  pause.  she kisses him on the cheek.

        anna
    bye.

  then turns and leaves.  leaving him.
