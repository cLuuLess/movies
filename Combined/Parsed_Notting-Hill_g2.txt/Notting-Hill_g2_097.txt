  int. william's kitchen - day

  anna is on the phone.  spike is blithely heading downstairs to
  the kitchen in just his underpants.

        spike
    morning, daring ones.

  he does a thumbs up to william -- very excited about what he knows
  was a 'result.'

        anna
      (on the phone)
    it's anna.  the press are here.  no,
    there are hundreds of them.  my
    brilliant plan was not so brilliant
    after all.  yeh, i know, i know.  just
    get me out then.
      (she hangs up)
    damnit.

  she heads upstairs.

        william
    i wouldn't go outside.

        spike
    why not?

        william
    just take my work for it.

  the moment william goes upstairs, spike heads for the front
  door.
