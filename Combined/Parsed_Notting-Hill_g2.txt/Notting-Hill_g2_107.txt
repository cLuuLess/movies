  int. tony's restaurant - night

  two hours later.  they've had a very good time.  there's been a
  chocolate cake.  lots of alcohol.  tony is playing 'blue moon'
  on the piano, and bernie joins him, singing.

  at one table bella and honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.

        bella
    i'm really horribly drunk.

  elsewhere, max an william are relaxed together.

        max
    so -- you've laid the ghost.

        william
    i believe i have.

        max
    don't give a damn about the famous girl.

        william
    no, don't think i do.

        max
    which means you won't be distracted by
    the fact that she's back in london,
    grasping her oscar, and to be found
    filming most days on hampstead heath.

  he puts down a copy of the 'evening standard' with a picture of
  anna on its cover.

        william
      (immediate gloom)
    oh god no.

        max
    so not over her, in fact.
