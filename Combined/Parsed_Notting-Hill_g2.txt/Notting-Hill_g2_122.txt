  william rushes up to the main desk.

        william

    conference?

        man at savoy

    press?

        william
    yes...

  he flashes a card.

        man at savoy

    card, sir.

        william

  honey shoots into shot, pushing bella's chair.

        bella
    he's with me.

        bella
