  ext. notting hill garden - night

  a little later in the walk.

        anna
    what's in there?

  they are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
  behind it.

        william
    gardens.  all these streets round
    here have these mysterious communal
    gardens in the middle of them.
    they're like little villages.

        anna
    let's go in.

        william
    ah no -- that's the point -- they're
    private villages -- only the people
    who live round the edges are allowed
    in.

        anna
    you abide by rules like that?

        william
    ahm...

  her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
  the answer to this.

        william
    heck no -- other people do -- but not
    me -- i just do what i want.

  he rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
  make it, and falls back onto the pavement...

        william
      (casually)
    whoopsidaisies.

        anna
    what did you say?

        william
    nothing.

        anna
    yes, you did.

        william
    no, i didn't.

        anna
    you said 'whoopsidaisies.'

  tiny pause.

        william
    i don't think so.  no one has said
    'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- i mean
    unless they're...

        anna
    there's no 'unless.'  no one has said
    "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
    even then it was only little girls
    with blonde ringlets.

        william
    exactly.  here we go again.

  he fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...

        william
    whoopsidaisies.

  they look at each other.

        william
    it's a disease i've got -- it's a
    clinical thing.  i'm taking pills and
    having injections -- it won't last
    long.

        anna
    step aside.

  she starts to climb.

        william
    actually be careful anna -- it's
    harder than it looks...

  but she's already almost over.

        william
    oh no it's not -- it's easy.

  a few seconds later.  anna jumps down into the garden.

        anna
    come on, flops.

  william clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
  off, and heads towards where she stands.

        william
    now seriously -- what in the world
    in this garden could make that
    ordeal worthwhile?

  she leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
  time -- she kisses him.  this time a proper kiss.  a tiny pause.

        william
    nice garden.
