  ext. newsagent - day

  william walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  we see,
  though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
  to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of anna on their front
  page.  headlines --'anna stunna'-- 'it's definitely her!'
  and 'scott of pantartica.'
