    hiya.

        honey
    oh god this is one of those key moments
    in life, when it's possible you can be
    really, genuinely cool -- and i'm going
    to fail a hundred percent.  i absolutely
    and totally and utterly adore you and i
    think you're the most beautiful woman
    in the world and more importantly i
    genuinely believe and have believed for
    some time now that we can be best
    friends.  what do you think?

        anna
    ahm... i think that sounds -- you know
    -- lucky me.  happy birthday.

  she hands her a present.

        honey
    oh my god.  you gave me a present.
    we're best friends already.  marry
    will -- he's a really nice guy and
    then we can be sisters.

        anna
    i'll think about it.

  the front door bell goes.

        max

  he heads out into the corridor to the front door.
