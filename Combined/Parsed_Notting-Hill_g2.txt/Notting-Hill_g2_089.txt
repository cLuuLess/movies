  int. william's living room - night

  a few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub.

        anna
    the thing that's so irritating is that
    now i'm so totally fierce when it comes
    to nudity clauses.

        william
    you actually have clauses in your
    contact about nudity?

        anna
    definitely.  'you may show the dent at
    the top of the artist's buttocks -- but
    neither cheek.  in the event of a stunt
    person being used, the artist must have
    full consultation.'

        william
    you have a stunt bottom?

        anna
    i could have a stunt bottom, yes.

        william
    would you be tempted to go for a
    slightly better bottom than your own?

        anna
    definitely.  ths is important stuff.

        william
    it's one hell of a job.  what do you put
    on your passport?  profession -- mel
    gibson's bottom.

        anna
    actually, mel does his own ass work.
    why wouldn't he?  it's delicious.

        william
    the ice cream or mel gibson's bottom?

        anna
    both.
