  int. william's living room

        william (cont'd)
    imagine if you will the stupidest
    person you've ever met -- are you
    doing that...?

  spike happens to be in the foreground of this shot.  he's read-
  ing a newspaper.

        ritz man
    yes, sir.  i have him in my mind.

        william
    and then double it -- and that is the
    -- what can i say -- git i'm living
    with and he cannot remember...

        spike
    try 'flintstone.'

        william
      (to spike)
    what?

        spike
    i think she said her name was
    'flintstone.'

        william
    does 'flintstone' mean anything to
    you?

        ritz man
    i'll put you right through, sir.

  flintstone is indeed the magic word.

        william
    oh my god.

  he practices how to sound.

        william
    hello.  hi.  hi.

        anna (v.o.)
    hi.

  we hear her voice -- don't see her.

        william
      (caught out)
    oh hi.  it's william thacker.  we,
    ahm i work in a bookshop.

        anna (v.o.)
    you played it pretty cool here,
    waiting for three days to call.

        william
    no, i've never played anything cool
    in my entire life.  spike, who i'll
    stab to death later, never gave me the
    message.

        anna (v.o.)
    oh -- okay.

        william
    perhaps i could drop round for tea or
    something?

        anna (v.o.)
    yeh -- unfortunately, things are
    going to be pretty busy, but... okay,
    let's give it a try.  four o'clock
    could be good.

        william
    right.  great.
      (he hangs up)
    classic.  classic.
