  int. the trafalgar suite sitting room - day

  there anna is, framed in the window.  glorious.

        william
    hi.

        anna
    hello.

        william
    i brought these, but clearly...

  there are lots of other flowers in the room.

        anna
    oh no, ho -- these are great.

  a fair amount of tension.  these two people hardly know each
  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.

        william
    sorry about not ringing back.  the
    whole two-names concept was totally too
    much for my flatman's pea-sized
    intellect.

        anna
    no, it's a stupid privacy thing.  i
    always choose a cartoon character --
    last time out, i was mrs. bambi.

  at which moment jeremy, karen's boss, comes in.  a fairly grave,
  authoritative fifty-year-old pr man consulting a list.

        jeremy
    everything okay?

        anna
    yes, thanks.

        jeremy
    and you are from 'horse and hound'
    magazine?

  william nods.

        anna
    is that so?

  william shrugs his shoulders.  jeremy settles at a little desk
  in the corner and makes notes.  a pause.  william feels he has to
  act the part.  they sit in chairs opposite each other.

        william
    so i'll just fire away, shall i?

  anna nods.

        william
    right.  ahm... the film's great...
    and i just wondered -- whether you
    ever thought of having more...
    horses in it?

        anna
    ahm -- well -- we would have liked to
    -- but it was difficult, obviously,
    being set in space.

        william
    obviously.  very difficult.

  jeremy leaves.

  william puts his head in his hands.  he was panic.

        william
    i'm sorry -- i arrived outside -- they
    thrust this thing into my hand -- i
    didn't know what to do.

        anna
    no, it's my fault, i thought this
    would all be over by now.  i just
    wanted to sort of apologize for the
    kissing thing.  i seriously don't
    know what got in to me.  i just wanted
    to make sure you were fine about it.

        william
    absolutely fine about it.

  re-enter jeremy.

        jeremy
    do remember that miss scott is also
    keen to talk about her next project,
    which is shooting later in the summer.

        william
    oh yes -- excellent.  ahm -- any horses
    in that one?  or hounds, of course.  our
    readers are equally intrigued by both
    species.
        anna
    it takes place on a submarine.

        william
    yes.  right... but if there were horses,
    would you be riding them yourself or
    would you be getting a stunt horse person
    double sort of thing?

  jeremy exits.

        william
    i'm just a complete moron.  sorry.
    this is the sort of thing that happens
    in dreams -- not in real life.  good
    dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to
    see you.

        anna
    and what happens next in the dream?

  it's a challenge.

        william
    well, i suppose in the dream dream
    scenario.  i just... ahm, change my
    personality, because you can do that
    in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the
    girl but you know it'll never happen.

  pause.  then they move towards each other when... jeremy
  enters.

        jeremy
    time's up, i'm afraid.  sorry it was
    so short.  did you get what you wanted?

        william
    very nearly.

        jeremy
    maybe time for one last question?

        william
    right.

  jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.

        william
    are you busy tonight?

        anna
    yes.

  they look at each other.  jeremy enters, with another journalists
  in tow.  anna and william stand and shake hands formally.

        anna
    well, it was nice to meet you.
    surreal but nice.

        william
    thank you.  you are 'horse and hound's'
    favorite actress.  you and black
    beauty.  tied.
