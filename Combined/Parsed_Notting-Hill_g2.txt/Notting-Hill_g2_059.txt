  int. ritz corridor/anna's suite - night

  william coming along the hotel corridor.  he knocks on the
  door.

        anna
    hiya.

  there's something slightly awry.  he doesn't notice.

        william
    hi.

  he kisses her gently on the cheek.

        william
    to be able to do that is such a
    wonderful thing.

        anna
      (pause)
    you've got to go.

        william
    why?

        anna
    because my boyfriend, who i thought
    was in america, is in fact in the
    next room.

        william
    your boyfriend?

  he is duly shocked.  she's trying to be calm.

        anna
    yes...

        jeff (v.o.)
    who is it?

  jeff drifts into view behind.  he is a very famous film star and
  looks the part -- well built, very handsome.  unshaven, he has
  magic charm, whatever he says.  over a t-shirt, he wears a
  shirt, which he unbuttons as he talks.

        william
    ahm... room service.

        jeff
    how you doing?  i thought you guys
    all wore those penguin coats.

        william
    well, yes -- usually -- i'd just
    changed to go home -- but i thought
    i'd just deal with this final call.

        jeff
    oh great.  could you do me a favour
    and try to get us some really cold
    water up here?

        william
    i'll see what i can do.

        jeff
    still, not sparkling.

        william
    absolutely.  ice cold still water.

        jeff
    unless it's illegal in the uk to
    serve liquids below room temperature:
    i don't want you going to jail just
    to satisfy my whims...

        william
    no, i'm sure it'll be fine.

        jeff
    and maybe you could just adios the
    dishes and empty the trash.

        william
    right.

  and he does just that.  scoops up the two used plates and heads
  to the bin.

        anna
    really -- don't do that -- i'm sure
    this is not his job.

        jeff
    i'm sorry.  is this a problem?

        william
    ah -- no.  it's fine.

        jeff
    what's your name?

        william
    ahm... bernie.

  jeff slips him a fiver.

        jeff
    thank you, bernie.
      (to anna)
    hey -- nice surprise, or nasty
    surprise?

        anna
    nice surprise.

  he kisses her.

        jeff
    liar.
      (to william)
    she hates surprises.  what are you
    ordering?

        anna
    i haven't decided.

        jeff
    well, don't over-do it.  i don't want
    people saying, 'there goes that
    famous actor with the big, fat
    girlfriend."

  he wanders off taking off his t-shirt.

        william
    i better leave.

  anna just nods.

        william
    -- this is a fairly strange reality
    to be faced with.  to be honest, i
    don't realize...

        anna
    i'm sorry... i don't know what to
    say.

        william
    i think goodbye is traditional.
