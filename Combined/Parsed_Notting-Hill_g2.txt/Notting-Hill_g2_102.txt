  int. william's kitchen/corridor - day

  they move from the kitchen into the corridor.

        anna
    and remember -- spike owes you an
    expensive dinner.  or holiday --
    depending if he's got the brains to get
    the going rate on betrayal.

        william
    that's not true.  and wait a minute...
    this is crazy behavior.  can't we just
    laugh about this?  seriously -- in the
    huge sweep of things, this stuff
    doesn't matter.

        spike
    what he's going to say next is -- there
    are people starving in the sudan.

        william
    well, there are.  and we don't need to
    go anywhere near that far.  my best
    friend slipped -- she slipped down-
    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a
    wheelchair for the rest of her life.
    all i'm asking for is a normal amount
    of perspective.

        anna
    you're right: of course, you're right.
    it's just that i've dealt with this
    garbage for ten years now -- you've had
    it for ten minutes.  our perspectives
    are different.

        william
    i mean -- today's newspapers will be
    lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.

        anna
    excuse me?

        william
    well, you know -- it's just one day.
    today's papers will all have been
    thrown away tomorrow.

        anna
    you really don't get it.  this story
    gets filed.  every time anyone writes
    anything about me -- they'll dig up
    these photos.  newspapers last forever.
    i'll regret this forever.

  he takes this in.  that's the end.

        william
    right.  fine.  i will do the opposite,
    if it's all right by you -- and always be
    glad you came.  but you're right -- you
    probably better go.

  she looks at him.  the doorbell goes again.  she opens the door.
  massive noise and photos.  outside are her people, including
  karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  and then the door is shut
  and they're all gone.  silence.
