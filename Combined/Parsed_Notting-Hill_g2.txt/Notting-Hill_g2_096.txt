  int./ext. william's corridor - day

  william heads down the corridor and opens the door.  outside
  are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and
  questions, of noise and light.  the press seem to fill the
  entire street.

        william
    jesus christ.

  he comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.  anna is in
  the kitchen.

        anna
    what?

        william
    don't ask.

  she heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.

        anna
    you're up to something...

  she thinks he's fooling around.  she opens the door, the same
  explosion.  in a split second she's inside.

        anna
    oh my god.  and they got a photo of you
    dressed like that?

        william
    undressed like this, yes.

        anna
    jesus.
