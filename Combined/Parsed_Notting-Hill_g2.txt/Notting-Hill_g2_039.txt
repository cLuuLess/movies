  int. max and bella's kitchen/living room - night

  bella and max are in the kitchen.

        max
    he's bringing a girl?

        bella
    miracles do happen.

        max
    does the girl have a name?

        bella
    he wouldn't say.

        max
    christ, what is going on in there?

  the oven seems to be smoking a little.  then the bell rings.

        max (cont'd)
      oh god.

  it's bad timing.  max shoots out of the kitchen.
