  a little later.  they're in the thick of the script.

        william
    'message from command.  would you like
    them to send in the hks?'

        anna
    'no, turn over 4 trs's and tell them we
    need radar feedback before the kft's
    return at 19 hundred -- then inform the
    pentagon that we'll be needing black
    star cover from ten hundred through
    12.15' -- and don't you dare say one
    word about how many mistakes i made in
    that speech or i'll pelt you with
    olives.

        william
    'very well, captain -- i'll pass that
    on straightaway.'

        anna
    'thank you.'  how many mistake did i
    make?

        william
    eleven.

        anna
    damn.  'and wainwright...'

        william
    cartwright.

        anna
    'cartwright, wainwright, whatever
    your name is, i promised little jimmy
    i'd be home for his birthday -- could
    you get a message through that i may
    be a little late.'

        william
    'certainly.  and little johnny?'

        anna
    my son's name is johnny?

        william
    yup.

        anna
    well, get a message through to him
    too.

        william
    brilliant.
      (the scene's over)
    word perfect i'd say.

        anna
    what do you think?

        william
    gripping.  it's not jane austen, it's
    not henry james, but it's gripping.

        anna
    you think i should do henry james
    instead?

        william
    i'm sure you'd be great in henry james.
    but, you know -- this writer's pretty
    damn good too.

        anna
    yes -- i mean -- you never get anyone
    in 'wings of a dove' having the nerve
    to say 'inform the pentagon that we
    need black star cover.'

        william
    and i think the book is the poorer for
    it.

  anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  he is helping.
