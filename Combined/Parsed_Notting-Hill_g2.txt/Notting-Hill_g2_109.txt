  ext. kenwood house - day

  now closer to the house, william approaches a barrier -- where
  he is himself approached.

        security
    can i help you?

        william
    yes -- i was looking for anna scott...

        security
    does she know you're coming?

        william
    no, no.  she doesn't.

        security
    i'm afraid i can't really let you
    through then, sir.

        william
    oh right.  i mean, i am a friend -- i'm
    not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...

        security
    ... can't let you through.

  at that moment -- thirty yards away, william sees trailer door
  open.  out of it comes anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
  velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
  she has a necessary cluster of people about her.  hair, make-up,
  costume and the third assistant who has collected her.

  she walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  and
  sees him.  her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
  simple smile.  his being there is a complicated thing.
  cut back to him.  he does a small wave.  she pauses as the whole
  paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  the
  movie divides them.  but then she begins to walk through it, and
  followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  when
  she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
  people hold back.  she doesn't really know what to say...

        anna
    this is certainly... ah...

        william
    i only found out you were here
    yesterday.

        anna
    i was going to ring... but... i didn't
    think you'd want to...

  the third assistant is under pressure.

        third
    anna.

  she looks around.  the poor third is nervous -- and the first is
  approaching.

        anna
      (to william)
    it's not going very well -- and it's
    our last day.

        william
    absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.

        anna
    but... wait... there are things to say.

        william
    okay.

        anna
    drink tea -- there's lots of tea.

  she is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.

        karen
    come and have a look...
