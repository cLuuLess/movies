  int. william's kitchen - day

  the two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen.

        william
    just incidentally -- why are you
    wearing that?

        spike
    ahm -- combination of factors really.
    no clean clothes...

        william
    there never will be, you know, unless
    you actually clean your clothes.

        spike
    right.  vicious circle.  and then i was
    like rooting around in your things,
    and found this, and i thought -- cool.
    kind of spacey.
