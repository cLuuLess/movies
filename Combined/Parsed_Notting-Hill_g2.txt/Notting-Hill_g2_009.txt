  int. william's house - day

        william
    spike!

  the house has far too many things in it.  definitely two-
  bachelor flat.

  spike appears.  an unusual looking fellow.  he has unusual
  hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual welsh accent: very
  white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  he wears
  only shorts.

        spike
    even he.  hey, you couldn't help me
    with an incredibly important
    decision, could you?

        william
    this is important in comparison to,
    let's say, whether they should
    cancel third world debt?

        spike
    that's right -- i'm at last going out
    on a date with the great janine and i
    just want to be sure i've picked the
    right t-shirt.

        william
    what are the choices?

        spike
    well... wait for it...
      (he pulls on a t-shirt)
    first there's this one...

  the t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
  coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  it says 'i love
  blood.'

        william
    yes -- might make it hard to strike a
    really romantic note.

        spike
    point taken.

  he heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...

        spike
    i suspect you'll prefer the next one.

  and he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,
  pointing down to his flies, saying, 'get it here.'

        spike
    cool, huh?

        william
    yes -- she might think you don't have
    true love on your mind.

        spike
    wouldn't want that...
      (and back up he goes)
    okay -- just one more.

  he comes down wearing it.  lots of hearts, saying, 'you're the
  most beautiful woman in the world.'

        william
    well, yes, that's perfect. well
    done.

        spike
    thanks.  great.  wish me luck.

        william
    good luck.

  spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  revealing that on the
  back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written
  'fancy a fuck?'
