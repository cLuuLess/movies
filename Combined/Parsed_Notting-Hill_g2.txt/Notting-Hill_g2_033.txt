  int. trafalgar suite corridor - day

  william exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  tarquin
  is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone.

        tarquin
    how was she?

        william
    fabulous.

        tarquin
    wait a minute -- she took your
    grandmother's flowers?

  william can't think his way out of this.

        william
    yes.  that's right.  bitch.

  he turns to go, but is accosted by karen.

        karen
    if you'd like to come with me we can
    rush you through the others.

        william
    the others?
