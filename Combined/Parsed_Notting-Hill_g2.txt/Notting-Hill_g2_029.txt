  the lift lands.  william gets out.  so does tarquin.  rooms
  30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  william heads right.
  so does tarquin.

  william is puzzled.  he slows down as he approaches room 38.  so
  does tarquin.  william spots, so does tarquin.  william points
  at the number.

        william

        tarquin
    yes.

        william
    oh.  right.

  he knocks.  a bright, well-tailored american girl opens the door.

        karen

  with the poster picture of anna, for the film 'helix.'
