  ext. piccadilly - day

  the car turns illegally right across piccadilly the wrong way
  down a one-way street and ends up outside the ritz.  william
  sprints into the hotel.  bernie follows.

        bernie
    bloody hell, this is fun.

  it. ritz lobby - day

        william
    is miss scott staying here?

  it is the same man.

        ritz man
    no, sir.

        william
    how about miss flintstone?

        ritz man
          no, sir.

        william
    or bambi... or, i don't know, beavis or
    butthead?

  man shakes his head.

        ritz man
    no, sir.

        william
    right.  right.  fair enough.  thanks.

  he turns despondent and takes two steps when the ritz man stops
  him in his tracks.

        ritz man
    there was a miss pocahontas in room 126
    -- but she checked out an hour ago.  i
    believe she's holding a press
    conference at the savoy before flying to
    america.

  william is very grateful.  he kisses the ritz man.  bernie's also
  gratuful.  he kisses him too.

        bernie
    we have lift off!!

  a japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the ritz
  man gets kissed a third time.
