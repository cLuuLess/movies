  int. anna's suite sitting room - day

  they knock on her door.

        anna (v.o.)
    come in.

  william enters.  a certain nervousness.  they are alone again.

        anna
    ahm.  that thing i was doing tonight
    -- i'm not doing it any more.  i told
    them i had to spend the evening with
    britain's premier equestrian
    journalist.

        william
    oh well, great.  perfect.  oh no --
    shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's
    birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be
    having dinner.

        anna
    okay -- fine.

        william
    but no, i'm sure i can get out of it.

        anna
    no, i mean, if it's fine with you,
    i'll, you know, be your date.

        william
    you'll be my date at my little sister's
    birthday party?

        anna
    if that's all right.

        william
    i'm sure it's all right.  my friend
    max is cooking and he's acknowledged
    to be the worst cook in the world, but
    you know, you could hide the food in
    your handbag or something.

        anna
    okay.

        william
    okay.
