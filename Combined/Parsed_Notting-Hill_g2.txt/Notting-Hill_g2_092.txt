  int. william's living room - night

  a few moments later.  william and anna stand in the middle of
  the room.  he kisses her neck.  then her shoulder.  what a
  miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  then
  he looks at her face.  that face.  he is suddenly struck by who
  it is.

        william
    wow.

        anna
    what?

  and then gets over it straight away.

        william
    nothing.

  and kisses her.
