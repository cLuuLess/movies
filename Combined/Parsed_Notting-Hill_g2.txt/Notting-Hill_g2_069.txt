  int. max and bella's kitchen/conservatory - night

  max walks over to the table.  honey, bella, william and another
  girl.

        max
    keziah -- some woodcock?

        keziah
    no, thank you  -- i'm a fruitarian.

        max
    i don't realize that.

  it is left to william, who has been set up here, to fill the
  pause.

        william
    and ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?

        keziah
    we believe that fruits and vegetables
    have feelings so we think cooking is
    cruel.  we only eat things that have
    actually fallen from the tree or bush
    -- that are, in fact, dead already.

        william
    right.  right.  interesting stuff.
      (pause)
    so these carrots...

        keziah
    have been murdered, yes.

        william
    murdered?  poor carrots.  how beastly.
