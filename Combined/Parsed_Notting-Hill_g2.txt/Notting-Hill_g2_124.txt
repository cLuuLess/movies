  int. lancaster room - day

  huge room -- full of press.  row after row of journalists,
  cameras at the front, tv cameras at the back.  anna clearly
  gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is
  positively presidential.  she sits at a table at the end of the
  room, beside karen: on her other side is jeremy, the pr boss,
  firmly marshalling the questions.

        jeremy
    yes... you -- dominic.

        questioner 1
    how much longer are you staying in the
    uk then?

        anna
    no time at all.  i fly out tonight.

  she's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.

        jeremy
    which is why we have to round it up now.
    final questions.

  he points at a journalist he knows.

        questioner  2
    is your decision to take a year off
    anything to do with the rumours about
    jeff and his present leading lady?

        anna
    absolutely not.

        questioner 2
    do you believe the rumours?

        anna
    it's really not my business any more.
    though i will say, from my experience,
    that rumours about jeff... do tend to
    be true.

  they love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.
  next question comes from someone straight right next to
  william.

        questioner 3
    last time you were here, there were some
    fairly graphic photographs of you and a
    young english guy -- so what happened
    there?

        anna
    he was just a friend -- i think we're
    still friends.

        jeremy
    yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.

  he is pointing straight at william, who has his hand up.

        william
    yes -- miss scott -- are there any
    circumstances in which you two might be
    more than just friends?

  anna sees who it is asking.

        anna
    i hoped there might be -- but no, i'm
    assured there aren't.

        william
    and what would you say...

        jeremy
    no, it's just one question per person.

        anna
    no, let him... ask away.  you were
    saying?

        william
    yes, i just wondered whether if it
    turned out that this... person...

        other journalist
      (to william)
    his name is thacker.

        william
    thanks.  i just wondered if mr. thacker
    realized he'd been a daft prick and got
    down on his knees and begged you to
    reconsider, whether you would...
    reconsider.

  we cut to max, bella, bernie and honey, all watching.  then back
  to anna.

        anna
    yes, i'm pretty sure i would.

        william
    that's very good news.  the readers of
    'horse and hound' will be absolutely
    delighted.

  anna whispers something to jeremy.

        jeremy
    dominic -- if you'd like to ask your
    question again?

        questioner 1
    yes -- anna -- how long are you
    intending to stay here in britain?

  pause.  anna looks up at william.  he nods.

        anna
    indefinitely.

  they both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --
  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos
  of william.  max and bella kiss.  bernie kisses a total stranger.
  spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.

        spike
    what happened?

        honey
    it was good.

  honey hugs him.  it's a new experience for spike.

  cut to william's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at
  anna.  they are both smiling.
