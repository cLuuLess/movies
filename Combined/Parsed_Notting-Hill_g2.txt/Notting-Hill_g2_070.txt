  int. max and bella's conservatory - night

  time for coffee and chocolates.  beside william sits the final,
  perfect girl.  she is rosie, quite young, smartly dressed,
  open-hearted.  it is just max and william and bella and her.

        rosie
    delicious coffee.

        max
    thank you.  i'm sorry about the lamb.

        rosie
    no -- i thought it was really, you know,
    interesting.

        william
    interesting means inedible.

        rosie
    really inedible -- yes that's right.

  they all laugh.  it's going very well.
