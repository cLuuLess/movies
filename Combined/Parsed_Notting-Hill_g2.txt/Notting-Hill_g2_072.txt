  int. max and bella's living room - night

  max and bella wait excitedly.

        max
    well?

        william
    she's perfect, perfect.

        bella
    and?

  william makes a gentle, exasperated gesture, then...

        william
    i think you have forgotten...
      (he looks at them)
    what an unusual situation you have
    here -- to find someone you actually
    love, who'll love you -- the chances
    are... always miniscule.  look at me
    -- not counting the american -- i've
    only loved two girls in my whole life,
    both total disasters.

        max
    that's not fair.

        william
    no really, one of them marries me and
    then leaves me quicker than you can
    say indiana jones -- and the other,
    who seriously ought to have known
    better, casually marries my best
    friend.

        bella
      (pause)
    still loves you though.

        william
    in a depressingly asexual way.

        bella
      (pause)
    i never fancied you much actually...

  they all roar with laughter.

        bella
    i mean i loved you -- you were terribly
    funny.  but all that kissing my ears...

        william
    oh no -- this is just getting worse.
    i am going to find myself, 30 years
    from now, still on this couch.

        bella
    do you want to stay?

        william
    why not -- all that awaits me at home
    is a masturbating welshman.

  music starts to play to take us through these silent scenes.
