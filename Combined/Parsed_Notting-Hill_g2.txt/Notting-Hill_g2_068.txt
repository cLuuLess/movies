  int. max and bella's kitchen/living room - night

  the kitchen.  william is looking uneasy.  a doorbell rings.

        max
    now -- try.

  william nods.  max heads off to the door.  we stay with william
  -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the
  corridor.

        tessa (v.o.)
    i got completely lost -- it's real
    difficult, isn't it?  everything's
    got the word 'kensington' in it --
    kensington park road, kensington
    gardens, kensington bloody park
    gardens...

  they reach the kitchen.  tessa is a lush girl with huge hair.

        max
    tessa -- this is bella my wife.

        tessa
    oh hello, you're in a wheelchair.

        bella
    that's right.

        max
    and this is william.

        tessa
    hello william.  max has told me
    everything about you.

        william
      (frightened)
    has he?

        max
    wine?

        tessa
    oh yes please.  come on, willie, let's
    get sloshed.

  she turns to take the wine and william has a split second to send
  a message of panic to bella.  she agrees -- it's bad.
