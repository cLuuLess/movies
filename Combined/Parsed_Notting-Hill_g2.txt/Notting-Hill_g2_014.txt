  ext. portobello road - day

  william swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
  portobello road and bumps straight into anna.  the orange
  juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  it soaks anna.

        anna
    oh jesus.

        william
    here, let me help.

  he grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
  far too near her breasts in the panic of it...

        anna
    what are you doing?!

  he jumps back.

        william
    nothing, nothing... look, i live just
    over the street -- you could get
    cleaned up.

        anna
    no thank you.  i need to get my car
    back.

        william
    i also have a phone.  i'm confident
    that in five minutes we can have you
    spick and span and back on the street
    again... in the non-prostitute sense
    obviously.

  in his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
  genuinely annoyed.  she turns and looks at him.

        anna
    okay.  so what does 'just over the
    street' mean -- give it to me in yards.

        william
    eighteen yards.  that's my house
    there.

  he doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  she looks down.
  she looks up at him.
