  ext. kenwood house - day

  a complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
  and a huge moving crane.  they end up next to the sound desk.

        karen
    this is harry -- he'll give you a pair of
    headphones so you can hear the dialogue.

  harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
  fellow.  he hands him the headphones.

        harry
    here we go.  the volume control is on
    the side.

        william
    that's great.

  william, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
  a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
  wide-shot.  he watches anna.  she is with her co-star in the
  henry james film -- let's call him james.

        james
    we are living in cloudcuckooland --
    we'll never get this done today.

        anna
    we have to.  i've got to be in new york
    on thursday.

        james
    oh, stop showing off.

  he studies an actress a few yards to the left.

        james
    god, that's an enormous arse.

        anna
    i'm not listening.

        james
    no, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
    many tragic young teenagers with
    anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
    she could perfectly well share round
    with at least ten other women -- and
    still be beg-bottomed.

        anna
    i said i'm not listening -- and i think,
    looking at something that firm, you and
    your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
    would be well-advised to keep quiet.

  back by the desk, william is listening and laughs.  that's his
  girl.  anna prepares.

        anna
    so i ask you when you're going to tell
    everyone, and you say...?

        james
    'tomorrow will be soon enough.'

        anna
    and then i... right.

        james
    who was that rather difficult chap you
    were talking to on the way up?

        anna
    oh... no one... no one.  just some...
    guy from the past.  i don't know what
    he's doing here.  bit of an awkward
    situation.
