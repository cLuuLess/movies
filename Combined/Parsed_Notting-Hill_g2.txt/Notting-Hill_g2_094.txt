  int. william's bedroom - day

  the morning.

        william
    it still strikes me as, well, surreal,
    that i'm allowed to see you naked.

        anna
    you and every person in this country.

        william
    oh god yes -- i'm sorry.

        anna
    what is it about men and nudity?
    particularly breasts -- how can you be so
    interested in them?

        william
    well...

        anna
    no seriously.  i mean, they're just
    breasts.  every second person in the
    world has got them...

        william
    more than that actually, when you think
    about it.  you know, meatloaf has a very
    nice pair...

        anna
    but... they're odd-looking.  they're
    for milk.  your mum's got them.  you
    must have seen a thousand of them --
    what's the fuss about?

        william
      (pause)
    actually, i can't think really -- let
    me just have a quick look...

  he looks under the sheet at her breasts.

        william
    no, beats me.

  she laughs...

        anna
    rita hayworth used to say -- 'they go to
    bed with gilda -- they wake up with me.'
    do you feel that?

        william
    who was gilda?

        anna
    her most famous part -- men went to bed
    with the dream -- and they didn't like
    it when they woke up with the reality --
    do you feel that way with me?

        william
      (pause)
    you're lovelier this morning than you
    have ever been.

        anna
      (very touched)
    oh.

  she looks at him carefully.  then leaps out of bed.

        anna
    i'll be back.
