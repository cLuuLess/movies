  int. the trafalgar suite ante-room - day

  a few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  there
  are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.

        karen
    what did you think of the film?

        tarquin
    marvellous.  'close encounters'
    meets 'jean de florette.'  oscar-
    winning stuff.

  they both turn to william for his opinion.

        william
    i agree.

        karen
    i'm sorry.  i didn't get down what
    magazines you're from.

        tarquin
    'time out.'

        karen
    great.  and you...

        william
      (seeing it on a coffee
       table)
    'horse and hound.'  the name's
    william whacker.  i think she might
    be expecting me.

        karen
    okay -- take a seat.  i'll check.

  they sit down as karen goes off.

        tarquin
    you've brought her flowers?

  william goes for the cover-up.

        william
    no -- they're... for my grandmother.
    she's in a hospital nearby.  thought
    i'd kill two birds with one stone.

        tarquin
    i'm sorry.  which hospital?

  pause.  he's in trouble.

        william
    do you mind me not saying -- it's a
    rather distressing disease and the
    name of the hospital rather gives it
    away.

        tarquin
    oh sure.  of course.

        karen
    mr. thacker.

  saved by the bell.
