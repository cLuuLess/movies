  int. max and bella's conservatory - night

  coffee time.

        max
    having you here, anna, firmly
    establishes what i've long suspected,
    that we really are the most desperate
    hot of under-achievers.

        bernie
    shame!

        max
    i'm not saying it's a bad thing, in
    fact, i think it's something we should
    take pride in.  i'm going to give the
    last brownie as a prize to the saddest
    act here.

  a little pause.  then william turns to bernie.

        william
    bernie.

        bernie
    well, obviously it's me, isn't it --
    i work in the city in a job i don't
    understand and everyone keeps getting
    promoted above me.  i haven't had a
    girlfriends since... puberty and,
    well, the long and short of it is,
    nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks
    get any chubbier, they never will.

        honey
    nonsense.  i fancy you.  or i did
    before you got so far.

        max
    you see -- and unless i'm much mistaken,
    your job still pays you rather a lot of
    money, while honey here, she earns
    nothing flogging her guts out at
    london's seediest record store.

        honey
    yes.  and i don't have hair -- i've got
    feathers, and i've got funny goggly
    eyes, and i'm attracted to cruel men and
    ... no one'll ever marry me because my
    boosies have actually started
    shrinking.

        max
    you see -- incredibly sad.

        bella
    on the other hand, her best friend is
    anna scott.

        honey
    that's true, i can't deny it.  she
    needs me, what can i say?

        bella
    and most of her limbs work.  whereas
    i'm stuck in its thing day and night,
    in a house full of ramps.  and to add
    insult to serious injury -- i've
    totally given up smoking, my favourite
    thing, and the truth is... we can't
    have a baby.

  dead silence.

        william
    bella.

  bella shrugs her shoulders.  bernie is totally grief-struck.

        bernie
    no.  not true...

        bella
    c'est la vie... we're lucky in lots
    of ways, but... surely it's worth a
    brownie.

  william reaches for her hand.  max breaks the sombre mood.

        max
    well, i don't know.  look at
    william.  very unsuccessful
    professionally.  divorced.  used to
    be handsome, now kind of squidgy
    around the edges -- and absolutely
    certain never to hear from anna again
    after she's heard that his nickname
    at school was floppy.

  they all laugh.  anna smiles across at william.

        william
    so i get the brownie?

        max
    i think you do, yes.

        anna
    wait a minute.  what about me?

        max
    i'm sorry?  you think you deserve the
    brownie?

        anna
    well... a shot at it.

        william
    you'll have to prove it.  this is a
    great brownie and i'm going to fight
    for it.  state your claim.

        anna
    well, i've been on a diet since i was
    nineteen, which means basically i've
    been hungry for a decade.  i've had a
    sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one
    of whom hit me: and every time my heart
    gets broken it gets splashed across
    the newspapers as entertainment.
    meantime, it cost millions to get me
    looking like this...

        honey
    really?

        anna
    really -- and one day, not long from
    now...

  while she says this, quiet settles around the table.  the thing
  is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.

        anna
    ... my looks will go, they'll find out
    i can't act and i'll become a sad
    middle-aged woman who looks a bit like
    someone who was famous for a while.

  silence... they all look at her... then.

        max
    nah!!!  nice try, gorgeous -- but you
    don't fool anyone.

  the mood is instantly broken.  they all laugh.

        william
    pathetic effort to hog the brownie.
