  int. bookshop - day

  the next day.  william and martin quietly co-existing.  an annoy-
  ing customer enters.  mr. smith.

        mr. smith
    do you have any books by dickens?

        william
    no, we're a travel bookshop.  we only
    sell travel books.

        mr. smith
    oh right.  how about that new john
    grisham thriller?

        william
    no, that's a novel too.

        mr. smith
    oh right.  have you got a copy of
    'winnie the pooh'?

  pause.

        william
    martin -- your customer.

        martin
    can i help you?

  william looks up.  at that moment the entire window is suddenly
  taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and
  entirely covered with a portrait of anna -- from her new film,
  'helix.'
