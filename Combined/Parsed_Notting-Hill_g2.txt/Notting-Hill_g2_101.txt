        william
    now stop.  stop.  i beg you -- calm down.
    have a cup of tea.

        anna
    i don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  i
    want to go home.

  the doorbell goes.

        william
    spike, check who that is... and for
    god's sake put some clothes on.

  spike leans merrily out of the window.

        spike
    looks like a chauffeur to me.
