  int. william's living room - evening

  william in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower.
  he shoots past spike.

        william
    bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  have
    you seen my glasses?

        spike
    no, 'fraid not.

        william
    bollocks.
      (still searching --
       with no help from
       spike)
    this happens every time i go to the
    cinema.  average day, my glasses are
    everywhere -- everywhere i look,
    glasses.  but the moment i need them
    they disappear.  it's one of life's
    real cruelties.

        spike
    that's compared to, like,
    earthquakes in the far east or
    testicular cancer?

        william
    oh shit, is that the time?  i have to
    go.
