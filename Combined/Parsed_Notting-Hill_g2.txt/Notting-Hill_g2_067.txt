  int. tony's restaurant - night

  only two tables are being used.  william and his friends are
  on their first course.  bernie reads an "evening standard,"
  with a picture of anna and jeff at heathrow airport.

        max
    you didn't know she had a boyfriend?

        william
    no -- did you?

  their looks make it obvious that everyone did.

        william
    bloody hell, i can't believe it --
    my whole life ruined because i don't
    read 'hello' magazine.

        max
    let's face facts.  this was always a
    no-go situation.  anna's a goddess
    and you know what happens to mortals
    who get involved with the gods.

        william
    buggered?

        max
    every time.  but don't despair -- i
    think i have the solution to your
    problems.

        william
    really?

  they all look to him for wise words.

        max
    her name is tessa and she works in
    the contracts department.  the hair,
    i admit, is unfashionable frizzy --
    but she's as bright as a button and
    kisses like a nymphomaniac on death
    row.  apparently.
