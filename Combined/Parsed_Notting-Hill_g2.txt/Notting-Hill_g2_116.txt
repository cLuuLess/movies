  int. tony's restaurant - day

  the restaurant is in the middle of being deconstructed.  the
  pictures are gone off the walls -- a kettle on a long extension
  lead is on the bare table behind.  they're all sitting there.

        william
    what do you think?  good move?

        honey
    good move: when all is said and done,
    she's nothing special.  i saw her
    taking her pants off and i definitely
    glimpsed some cellulite down there.

        bella
    good decision.  all actresses are mad
    as snakes.

        william
    tony -- what do you think?

        tony
    never met her, never want to.

        william
    brilliant.  max?

        max
    absolutely.  never trust a vegetarian.

        william
    great.  excellent.  thanks.

  spike enters.

        spike
    i was called and i came.  what's up?

        honey
    william has just turned down anna scott.

        spike
    you daft prick!

  bella is casually looking at the painting that sits beside
  william.  it is the original of the chagall, the poster of which
  was on his wall.

        bella
    this painting isn't the original, is
    it?

        william
    yes, i think that one may be.

        bernie
    but she said she wanted to go out with
    you?

        william
    yes -- sort of...

        bernie
    that's nice.

        william
    what?

        bernie
    well, you know, anybody saying they
    want to go out with you is... pretty
    great... isn't it...

        william
    it was sort of sweet actually -- i mean,
    i know she's an actress and all that, so
    she can deliver a line -- but she said
    that she might be as famous as can be --
    but also... that she was just a girl,
    standing in front of a boy, asking him
    to love her.

  they take in the line.  it totally reverses their attitudes.
  a pause.

        william
    oh sod a dog.  i've made the wrong
    decision, haven't i?

  they look at him.  spike does a big nod.

        william
    max, how fast is your car?
