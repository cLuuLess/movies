  int. william's corridor - day

  spike closes the door and wanders along to a mirror in the hall-
  way, muttering.

        spike
    how did i look?

  inspects himself.

        spike
    not bad.  no bad at all.  well-chosen
    briefs, i'd say.  chicks love grey.
    mmmmm.  nice firm buttocks.
