  int. william's bedroom - day

  william enters.  he's unhappy for her.  she's almost dressed.

        william
    how are you doing?

        anna
    how do you think i'm doing?

        william
    i don't know what happened.

        anna
    i do.  your furry friend thought he'd
    make a buck or two telling the papers
    where i was.

  she's packing.

        william
    that's not true.

        anna
    really?  the entire british press just
    woke up this morning and thought 'hey --
    i know where anna scott is.  she's in
    that house with the blue door in notting
    hill.'  and then you go out in your
    goddamn underwear.

        spike
      (dropping in)
    i went out in my goddamn underwear too.

        william
    get out, spike.
      (he does)
    i'm so sorry.

        anna
    this is such a mess.  i come to you to
    protect myself against more crappy
    gossip and now i'm landed in it all
    over again.  for god's sake, i've got
    a boyfriend.

        william
    you do?

  it's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand.

        anna
    as far as they're concerned i do.  and
    now tomorrow there'll be pictures of
    you in every newspapers from here to
    timbuktu.

        william
    i know, i know -- but... just -- let's
    stay calm...

        anna
    you can stay calm -- it's the perfect
    situation for you -- minimum input,
    maximum publicity.  everyone you ever
    bump into will know.  'well done you --
    you slept with that actress -- we've
    seen the pictures.'

        william
    that's spectacularly unfair.

        anna
    who knows, it may even help business.
    buy a boring book about egypt from the
    guy who screwed anna scott.

  she heads out.
