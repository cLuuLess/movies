  int. william's kitchen - day

  william and anna at the kitchen table, eating toast, dringking
  tea.

        anna
    i'm really sorry about last time.  he
    just flew in -- i had no idea -- in fact,
    i had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.

        william
    no, that's fine.  it's not often one
    has the opportunity to adios the plates
    of a major hollywood star.  it was a
    thrill for me.
      (she smiles.  pause)
    how is he?

        anna
    i don't know.  it got to the point where
    i couldn't remember any of the reasons
    i loved him.  and you... and love?

        william
    well, there's a question -- without
    an interesting answer.

        anna
    i have thought about you.

        william
    oh no no -- no.

  he doesn't think she has to talk about this.

        anna
    just anytime i've tried to keep
    things normal with anyone normal --
    it's been a disaster.

        william
    i appreciate that absolutely.
      (changing subject
       tactfully)
    is that the film you're doing?

        anna
    yes -- start in l.a. on tuesday.

        william
    would you like me to take you through
    your lines?

        anna
    would you?  it's all talk, talk, talk.

        william
    hand it over.  basic plot?

        anna
    i'm a difficult but brilliant junior
    officer who in about twenty minutes
    will save the world from nuclear
    disaster.

        william
    well done you.
