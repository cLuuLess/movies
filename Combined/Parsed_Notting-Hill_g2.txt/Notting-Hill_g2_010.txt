  ext. portobello road - day

        william (v.o.)
    and so it was just another hopeless
    wednesday, as i set off through the
    market to work, little suspecting
    that this was the day which would
    change my life forever.  this is
    work, by the way, my little travel
    book shop...

  a small unpretentious store... named 'the travel book co.'

        william (v.o.)
    ... which, well, sells travel books
    -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
    always sell many of those.

  william enters.
