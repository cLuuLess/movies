  int. kitchen - day

  william is tidying up frantically.  then he hears anna's feet on
  the stairs.  she walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
  top beneath her leather jacket.  with her trainers still on.  he
  is dazzled by the sight of her.

        william
    would you like a cup of tea before
    you go?

        anna
    no thanks.

        william
    coffee?

        anna
    no.

        william
    orange juice -- probably not.

  he moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.

        william
    something else cold -- coke, water,
    some disgusting sugary drink
    pretending to have something to do
    with fruits of the forest?

        anna
    really, no.

        william
    would you like something to nibble --
    apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
    why, no one knows -- because it stops
    them tasting of apricots, and makes
    them taste like honey, and if you
    wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
    instead of apricots, but nevertheless
    -- there we go -- yours if you want
    them.

        anna
    no.

        william
    do you always say 'no' to everything?

  pause.  she looks at him deep.

        anna
    no.
      (pause)
    i better be going.  thanks for your
    help.

        william
    you're welcome and, may i also say...
    heavenly.

  it has taken a lot to get this out loud.  he is not a smooth-
  talking man.

        william
    take my one chance to say it.  after
    you've read that terrible book,
    you're certainly not going to be
    coming back to the shop.

  she smiles.  she's cool.

        anna
    thank you.

        william
    yes.  well.  my pleasure.

  he guides her towards the door.

        william
    nice to meet you.  surreal but nice.

  in a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  he
  closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  then...

        william
    'surreal but nice.'  what was i
    thinking?

  ... he  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
  the corridor in silence.  there's a knock on the door.  he moves
  back, casually...

        william
    coming.

  he opens the door.  it's her.

        william
    oh hi.  forget something?

        anna
    i forgot my bag.

        william
    oh right.

  he shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
  bag.  then returns and hands it to her.

        william
    here we go.

        anna
    thanks.  well...

  they stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  second time
  saying goodbye.  a strange feeling of intimacy.  she leans
  forward and she kisses him.  total silence.  a real sense of the
  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  they part.

        william
    i apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
    comment.  disaster...

        anna
    don't worry about it.  i thought the
    apricot and honey business was the
    real lowpoint.

  suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.

        william
    oh my god.  my flatmate.  i'm sorry --
    there's no excuse for him.

  spike walks in.

        spike
    hi.

        anna
    hi.

        william
    hi.

  spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.

        spike
    i'm just going to go into the kitchen
    to get some food -- and then i'm going
    to tell you a story that will make your
    balls shrink to the size of raisins.

  and leaves them in the corridor.

        anna
    probably best not tell anyone about
    this.

        william
    right.  no one.  i mean, i'll tell
    myself sometimes but... don't worry
    -- i won't believe it.

        anna
    bye.

  and she leaves, with just a touch of william's hand.  spike
  comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
  styrofoam container with a spoon.

        spike
    there's something wrong with this
    yogurt.

        william
    it's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.

        spike
    well, there you go.
      (takes another big spoonful)
    on for a video fest tonight?  i've
    got some absolute classic.
