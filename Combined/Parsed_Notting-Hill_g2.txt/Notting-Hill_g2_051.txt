  ext. max and bella's house - night

  william and anna step outside.  from inside they hear a massive
  and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
  feelings.  william is a little embarrassed.

        william
    sorry -- they always do that when i
    leave the house.

  the house is in lansdowne road, on the edge of notting hill.
  they walk for a moment.  a bit of silence.

        anna
    floppy, huh?

        william
    it's the hair!  it's to do with the
    hair.

        anna
    why is she in a wheelchair?

        william
    it was an accident -- about eighteen
    months ago.

        anna
    and the pregnancy thing -- is that to
    do with the accident?

        william
    you know, i'm not sure.  i don't
    think they'd tried for kids before,
    as fate would have it.

  they walk in silence for a moment.  then...

        william
    would you like to come... my house is
    just...?

  she smiles and shakes her head.

        anna
    too complicated.

        william
    that's fine.

        anna
    busy tomorrow?

        william
    i thought you were leaving.

        anna
    i was.
