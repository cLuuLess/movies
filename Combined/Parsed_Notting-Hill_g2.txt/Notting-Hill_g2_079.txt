  the two of them.

        anna
    they were taken years ago -- i know
    it was... well, i was poor and it
    happens a lot -- that's not an excuse
    -- but to make things worse, it now
    appears someone was filming me as
    well.  so what was a stupid photo-
    shoot now looks like a porno film.
    and well... the pictures have been
    solid and they're everywhere.

  william shakes his head.

        anna
    i don't know where to go.  the hotel
    is surrounded.

        william
    this is the place.

        anna
    thank you.  i'm just in london for two
    days -- but, with your papers, it's the
    worse place to be.

  she's very shaken.

        anna
    these are such horrible pictures.
    they're so grainy... they make me
    look like...

        william
    don't think about it.  we'll sort it
    out.  now what would you like -- tea
    ... bath...?

        anna
    a bath would be great.
