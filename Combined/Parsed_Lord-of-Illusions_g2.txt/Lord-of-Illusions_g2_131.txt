	ext. nix's house - night

	now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house.
	through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp flames.

	there is a low, ominous chant floating from the house.

	it has no words, but it is steadily building in intensity. 
	we drift towards the front door.
