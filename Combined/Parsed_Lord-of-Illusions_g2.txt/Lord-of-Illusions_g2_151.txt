	nix strides into the middle of the room.

				nix
			(whispered to dorothea)
		something terrible's going to
		happen.  but if you hold on to me,
		very tight, you may live a little
		longer.

	the cultists enter the room, knees and hands bloody.

				nix
			(to cultists)
		are you ready for my wisdom?
