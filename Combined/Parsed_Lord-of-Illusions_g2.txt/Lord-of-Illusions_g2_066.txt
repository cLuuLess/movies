	int. wiltern theatre - stage - night

	dorothea kneels at swann's side.  a few yards from her, harry
	examines the mechanism of the wheel.

				dorothea
			(softly)
		swann... 

	a doctor appears.

				doctor 
		i'm a doctor.  let me through. 

	the doctor checks swann's body.

				doctor
			(to dorothea)
		i'm sorry...

	harry has discovered a cable snaking down beside the device. 
	he's suspicious.  he slips round to the back of the
	mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the
	cable as he goes.

	wiltern theatre - below stage - night

	it's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the props that are
	used in the show, including the dragon we saw at the
	beginning.  from above we hear footsteps and voices, muted
	and echoing. 

	the cable ends in bare wires.  whatever was here has been
	taken. 

	a noise, behind harry.  he swings round.  sees a shadowy
	figure ducking away.

				harry
		hey!

	he gives chase.  loses the man in the shadows.  stops and
	listens for movement. 

	suddenly, miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of
	wood and smashes it into harry's face!

	harry reels back.  falls to his knees, blood running from his
	nose.  miller pulls harry's gun out of his jacket.

				miller
		got you, fucker!

	harry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  and now, out of
	the dragon's mouth, comes butterfield. 

				butterfield
		who did this, d'amour?  who killed
		swann? 

	harry is barely holding on to consciousness.

				harry
		you did.
			(a beat)
		didn't you?

				butterfield
		why would i do that?

				harry
		beats me.

	butterfield is a foot from harry now.

				butterfield
		you don't have a clue what you're
		into, do you?

				harry
		deep shit? 

	butterfield hits him.

				butterfield
		who did this?

				harry
		i told you --

	butterfield hits him again.

				butterfield
		who did this?

				harry
			(raises his hand)
		all right.  it was...

	butterfield comes a little closer.

				harry
			(feigning a near collapse)
		... it was...

	butterfield leans in.  and harry grabs him by the balls --
	literally -- rising as he does so.

				butterfield
		aah!

	harry throws butterfield aside. butterfield hits the ground
	in agony, and harry swings round to protect himself from
	miller, who's leveling harry's gun. 

	he fires once, missing harry by inches.  harry catches hold
	of a rope underfoot and pulls it, tripping miller, who
	topples backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  the gun goes
	off again, the bullet blowing apart the dragon's jaw
	mechanism. 

	miller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the
	dragon's steel teeth.  he has harry in his sights. 

	-- something creaks.  he looks up.  the dragon's jaw is
	closing, fast.  he starts to scramble to his feet.  too late! 
	the teeth slam closed on his body.  sudden death. 

	harry looks round to see butterfield retreating into the
	shadows.  then he's gone.  harry looks down at miller's
	blood, which is pooling around his feet.

				harry
		deep shit...

				fade out

				fade in
