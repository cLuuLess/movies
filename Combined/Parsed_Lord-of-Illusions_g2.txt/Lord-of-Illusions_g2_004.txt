	ext. nix's house - day

	we're at the front door now, which stands open.  leaning
	against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed youth, about
	sixteen.  his name is butterfield.  he's got a brooding,
	almost sultry look on his face.  one of his eyes is black,
	the other milky blue.  he's whittling something with a
	scalpel. distantly, the sound of car engines.  butterfield
	narrows his eyes.

	butterfield's p.o.v.

	the volkswagen "bus" and thunderbird are approaching the
	house.

		swann...?

	he turns from the door.  in his haste he drops the wood he's
	whittling.  he's been carving a death's head.
