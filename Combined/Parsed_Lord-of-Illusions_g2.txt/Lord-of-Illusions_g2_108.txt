	ext. hollywood cemetery - day

	we crane down from a high angle on a grave, surrounded by
	mourners.  the graveside service has just ended, and the
	mourners are beginning to disperse.  dorothea is there
	amongst them, of course.  so are several faces we recognize: 
	vinovich, wilder, billy who, swann's stage manager, his
	dancers, his technicians.  there are also several members of
	the press, and thirty or fourty other mourners, some of whom,
	to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. 

	harry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden)
	from the doorway of a mausoleum.  his eyes are on dorothea as
	she goes amongst the mourners, receiving unheard words of
	condolesence.
