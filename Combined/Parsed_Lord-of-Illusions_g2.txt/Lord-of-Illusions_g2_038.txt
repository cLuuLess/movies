	ext. quaid's offices - alley behind building - night

	the flashing lights of two patrol cars illuminate the scene. 
	detective eddison, a surfer-turned-policeman with buzz-cut
	blond hair, heads along the alley with harry.  he's midway
	through taking harry's statement. there are already two
	officers examining the drapes.  we can't yet see the body.

				eddison
			(to harry)
		what were you doing up there?

				harry
		i'm a private detective.  i was
		hired to follow somebody for a few
		days.  a guy called tapert.
		insurance fraud.

				eddison
			(writing)
		tapert.  so, now i've got tapert,
		butterfield.

				harry
		tapert's got nothing to do with
		this.  he came here to get his palm
		read.

				eddison
		what makes you so sure?

				harry
			(shrugs)
		i got a file on him two inches
		thick.  he's a petty fraudster.
		this is something else.  ever heard
		of someone called the puritan?

				eddison
		new one on me.
			(to officer)
		okay.  let's see him.

	officer #l shakes his head, and opens up the drape. broken
	glass drops from the folds, but that's all. miller has gone.

				eddison
		where the fuck is he?

				harry
		he got up and walked.

				eddison
			(looking up at window)
		after that fall?. he must have
		broken half his bones.

	we move in on harry, as he stares down at the drape.

				harry
		i don't think he'd have given a
		shit.
