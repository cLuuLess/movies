	int. semi-derelict building - operating theatre - day

	narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window
	fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded
	equipment.  eerie.  disturbing. 

	harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.

				harry
		i knew you wouldn't be able tn stay
		away.

	silence.  harry notices the beard and glasses on the
	operating table.

				harry
		you had to see who wept for you the
		most.

	silence.

				harry
		a lot of people are going to be
		really pissed off when they
		discover you're still alive.

				swann (v.o.)
		they'll never find out. 

	harry looks up.

	svanrt is hovering in the air above him.  the veins in his
	temples bulge and throb.  this trick requires a lot of
	concentration.

				harry
		look, ma, no wires.

				swann
		you shouldn't have followed me,
		d'amour.

				harry
		how the fuck do you do that?

				swann
		now i'm going to have to kill you.

				harry
		i don't think so.  you need me
		alive.

				swann
		why?  so you can fuck my wife?

	swann swoops down towards harry, who levels his gun.

				harry
		be careful.  funerals make me
		trigger-happy.

	swann stops, inches from the ground.

				harry
		you know, it's such a fucking
		waste.  you can do shit most of us
		can only dream about, and you go
		around pretending it's some trick.

				swann
		illusionists get. las vegas
		contracts, d'amour.  magicians get
		burned.

				harry
		or murdered, like nix.

				swann
		he deserved it.

				harry
		maybe he doesn't see it that way. 
		maybe he's digging his
		way out of the hole you put him
		right now.  that's what you're
		hiding away from, isn't it?

				swann
		i did it for dorothea.

				harry
		oh yeah?

				swann
		now that i'm dead, the spotlight's
		off her.

	harry grabs swann, literally pulling him down to earth. now
	they're face to face.  eye to eye.  swann, for all his
	posturing, is afraid.

				harry
		so nix won't come looking for her?

				swann
		it's me betrayed him.

				harry
		and she shot him i  i think that'd
		piss me off if i were nix.

				swann
			(despairing)
		i don't know what else to do.

				harry
		help me.

	on swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.

				harry
		listen.  if he's back from the
		dead, then he is some kind of god. 
		and he'll find you, wherever the
		fuck you are. 
		and if he's just another phony
		messiah, then you can stage the
		greatest come-back in history.

	on swann.  this doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.
