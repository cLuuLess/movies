	int. nix's house - meditation room - night

	the pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. dorothea is
	backed towards it by nix. 

	when nix speaks, his voice is not remotely human.  it is
	demoniacal.

				nix
		i am the purest of the pure.  i am
		the darkest of the dark...

	harry is at the door now, starting towards nix.

				swann
		harry.  you can't kill him. 

	harry crouches beside swann.

				harry
			(whispers)
		he did something with the ground.

				swann
		yes?

				harry
		can you do it?

				swann
		i don't know.

				harry
		try.

	on dorothea.  she's a couple of yards from the pit now.

				nix (v.o.)
		i'm beyond heaven.  i'm beyond
		hell.

	suddenly, harry lunges at nix, grabbing hold of his legs. 
	nix topples.

	on swann, who puts his hands on the ground.  closes his eyes. 

	a wave of liquification runs through the ground from swann's
	broken fingers -- 

	-- the cultists' bodies move in the softening ground, like
	corpses in surf, and roll towards the pit, their dead faces
	resurfacing --

	barbara's body floats past nix, and disappears over       
	the edge of the pit.

				harry
			(to dorothea)
		get out of here!

	the ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging
	around nix as they're all carried towards the pit.  so's
	harry, of course. 

	nix tries to get up, but he's too late.  the corpses weigh
	him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper
	hold, and harry still clings to his legs.

				nix
		no!  no!  no!

	he's at the edge of the pit.

				dorothea (v.o.)
		harry!

	harry looks round.  dorothea's behind him, risking the
	flowing ground to offer him a hand. 

	nix starts to fall into the pit.  at the last minute, he
	reaches for harry, as -- 

	-- harry is pulled out of reach bv dorothea. 

	together they stumble to the door, where swann still lies. 
	they look back to see 

	nix, as he goes over the edge of the pit and falls screaming. 

	at the door, dorothea lifts up swann's head.  he's dead. she
	closes his eyes.
