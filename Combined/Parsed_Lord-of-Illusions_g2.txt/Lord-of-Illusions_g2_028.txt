	a large deteriorating mural of hollywoodland, depicting a
	host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. 
	at the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands
	harry d'amour.  he is having difficulty getting the pretty
	but vacant blonde at the reception desk to comprehend his
	name.

	harry turns.  he's wearing a washed-out grateful dead t-
	shirt, an italian cut linen suit, and glasses.  he's
	handsome, unshaven, 35-ish, with an open easy smile.

				harry

	harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten-dollar
	bills.
