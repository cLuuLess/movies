	int. harry's hotel room - day

	on the suit-case, which is now on the bed.  harry flings it
	open.  inside, mingled with the clothes, a bizarre collection
	of items, which he tosses out onto the coverlet.  a gun.  a
	crucifix.  a statue of shiva, the hindu lord of creation and
	destruction. 

	on harry, as he heads into the bathroom.  turns on the
	shower.  starts to undress.
