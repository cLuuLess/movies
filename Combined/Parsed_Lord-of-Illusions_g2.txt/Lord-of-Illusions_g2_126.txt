	int. harry's car - dusk

	harry drives.  swann takes a throatful of brandy.  then he
	stares at harry.

				swann
		you think i'm an asshole.

				harry
		didn't know you read minds.

				swann
			(a warning)
		i can do a lot of shit, d'amour. 
		but you know that.
			(an apology)
		so i like playing games with
		people.  gives them something to
		wonder about...

				harry
		is that all?

				swann
		i distract them from their banality
		for a few minutes. it's like a
		public service.  it doesn't mean
		much in the end. they're all going
		to die.

				harry
		and you're not? 

	silence for a moment.

				swann
		oh, i was going to discover the
		secret of the universe.  that's why
		i liked nix.  he promised me all
		these explanations.

				harry
		and he didn't have them?

				swann
		he had something.  he showed me how
		to bend the rules.  a little
		levitation.  a few fireworks.

				harry
		is that all?

				swann
		no.
			(a beat)
		at the end... when we had him
		cornered, he got into my head. he
		showed me what we really look like,
		when the veneer's gone.  jelly. 
		shit...

				harry
		and you believed him?

				swann
		i saw it with my own fucking eyes! 
		see, that's his best trick.  no
		illusions.  just the truth.
			(he looks at harry)
		are you ready for that? 

	harry grabs the brandy bottle from swann.

				swann
		hey!

	harry drinks.

				swann
		thought not.
