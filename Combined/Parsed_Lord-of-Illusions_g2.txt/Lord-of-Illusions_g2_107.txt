	int. swann's mansion - study - night

	harry interrogates valentin in a white fury, while dorothea
	binds harry's hand.

				harry
		you rigged the illusion to fail,
		right?

				valentin
		yes.

				harry
		you paid off the doctor.  you set
		up the fake body.  yes?

				valentin
		yes.

				harry
		and then... because i was
		getting too close to something --
			(at dorothea)
		--or someone, you called swann

				valentin
		i tried to pay you off.

				harry
		was that swann's idea?

				valentin
		no.  it was mine.  i didn't want
		any more bloodshed. that's why we
		went to all this trouble, so
		there'd be no one for nix to come
		after.

				harry
		nix is dead and buried, for
		fuck's sake.

				valentin
		haven't you seen enough to know
		that doesn't matter?

	on harry.  he looks as though he's beginning to think maybe
	nix's resurrection is plausible.

				harry
		i want to see swann face to face.

				valentin
		why don't you leave this alone? let
		everybody think it's over?

				dorothea
		what about me?

				valentin
		nix was never interested in you. 
		it was always swann. 

	a beat.

				harry
			(to dorothea)
		maybe valentin's right.  we should
		let it alone. 

	a bell starts to toll-

				harry
			(con't.)
		he went to all that trouble to be
		dead.  maybe we should let him stay
		that way.

	the tolling carries over into
