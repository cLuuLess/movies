	int. wiltern theatre - stage - day

	valentin hears something in the auditorium.  looks up.

				valentin
		who's there?

	he reaches into his jacket to draw a gun. there's a noise. 
	he swings round.  too late.

	butterfield has a scalpel at his throat.  he kicks valentin
	to the ground.

				butterfield
			(conversationally)
		i've sometimes thought, if i'd had
		another profession, i would have
		been a surgeon.

	on valentin, staring up in terror. 

	valentin's p.o.v.- of butterfield, upside down, above him,
	the scalpel glittering.

				butterfield
		to be able to heal with one little
		cut.

	on valentin again, as butterfield's blade touches his cheek,
	just beneath his eye.

				valemtin
		no. . .

				butterfield
		let's say those eyes of yours were
		giving you trouble.

				valentin
		please.

				butterfield
		i could scoop them out.

				valentin
		don't.

				butterfield
		so tell me where nix is buried.

				valentin
		i don't know.

	butterfield pushes the blade into valentin's skin. 

	cut wide, as valentin thrashes, his face obscured by
	butterfield's body.

				valentin
		wait!

	on valentin again.  there is a small cut beneath his eye, but
	that's all.

				valentin
		i'll tell you.

				butterfield
		you'll do more.than that.
