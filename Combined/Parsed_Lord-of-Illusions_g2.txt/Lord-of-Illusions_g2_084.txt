	int. st. luke's sanitorium - day

	the place is bland and functional throughout, the walls
	decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. 
	nothing disturbing.  harry is talking to d.a. toffler -
	black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a nurse.

				toffler
		jennifer's only ever had one
		visitor.

				harry
		a mister quaid?

				toffler
		right.  and he's dead, isn't he?  i
		saw it on the news. jennifer
		doesn't know.  and frankly, this
		isn't the best tine for her to be
		told.

				harry
		i won't say anything.
