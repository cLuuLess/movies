	ext. hollywood cemetery - day

	the sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white
	marble tombs.  harry and valentin walk towards a large
	mausoleum.

				harry
		any movie stars buried here?

				valentin
		probably.

				harry
		it's not a bad place.  warm.
		great view.

				valentin
		i don't think the dead much care.

				harry
		are you sure?

				valentin
		are you a believer, then?

	valentin gives him an inquisitive look.

				harry
		i've signed on for them all in my
		time.  hindu.  catholic. you can't
		have too many saviours.

	harry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman
	in white standing in its cool shadows:  dorothea swann.  she
	wears a wide-brimmed hat.

				harry
		who is she?

				valentin
		swann's wife.

				cut to:

	valentin sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  he
	glances up. 

	harry and dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in
	conversation.

				dorothea
		i want you to help me help my
		husband.  i know he's in some kind
		of trouble.  and it's something to
		do with the man you saw murdered.

				harry
		did your husband know quaid?

				dorothea
		yes.  they weren't close, but they
		saw each other once in a while.  i
		think philip believes all that
		stuff with the tarot cards.

				harry
		you don't?

				dorothea
		i think we make our own futures.

	harry makes an approving murmur.

				harry
		what's the connection?

				dorothea
			(covering now, but well)
		i don't exactly know. 
		philip doesn't like to talk about
		the past.

				harry
		why not?

	dorothea stops talking.  takes off her sunglasses.  her gaze
	is troubled, but direct.  there is an attraction between the
	two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue.

				dorothea
		he's a secretive man.

				harry
		and you don't ask questions?

				dorothea
		we don't share our lives the way a
		lot of people do.

				harry
		does that mean...?

				dorothea
		we haven't slept in the same bed
		for years.

				harry
		but obviously you still care what
		happens to him.

				dorothea
		we wouldn't be having this
		conversation if i didn't. swann's
		one of the most remarkable men
		alive.

	harry, frowns.

				dorothea
		you don't believe me.

				harry
		he's an illusionist.  it's not
		exactly brain surgery. 

	dorothea stares at him. 

				harry
		sorry.  you asked.

				dorothea
		no.  you're right.  he could have
		been something more. maybe a lot
		more.  but people get lost.  even
		good people. too much fame.  too
		much money,

				harry
		where do i sign? 

	dorothea laughs lightly.

				dorothea
		will you take the job, mr. d'amour?

				harry
		harry.

				dorothea
		harry.

				harry
		i'm no bodyguard.

				dorothea
		that's not what i'm asking for. i
		want somebody who can find out what
		philip saw in those damn cards. 
		and stop it from happening.

				harry
		when do you want me to start?

				dorothea
		come to the show with me. tonight i
		want you to see him with an
		audience.  they love him.

				harry
		do you?

	the question catches dorothea off guard.

				dorothea
		i didn't marry him for love, mr.
		d'amour.  tonight?

				harry
		sure.

	dorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  harry watches
	her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her
	departing figure.
