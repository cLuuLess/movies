	int. magic castle - repository - night

	undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and
	posters in every direction.

				billy
			(impressed)
		whoa...

	on the wall, plaster life-masks.  in glass cases, the tools
	of the great magicians:  knives, keys, guns, wands, even an
	iron maiden.  billy is in awe.  he wanders around wide-eyed
	while harry scans the shelves. the dialogue runs as they
	investigate.

				billy
		i hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.

				harry
		you heard right.

				billy
		you ever been married?

				harry
		yeah.  she was killed in a car
		crash.  her lawyer was driving. she
		was filing for divorce.

				billy
		why?

				harry
		my life was too weird for her.

				billy
			(grinning)
		i love weird.

	harry has seen a small sigil carved onto one of the shelves.

				harry
		billy?  this was on miller's
		forehead.  any idea what it is?

				billy
		nope.

	harry presses it.  the entire bookcase opens up, creaking.

				billy
		what did i tell you?  so fucking
		hokey.

	inside, there is a small shelf.  on it, files and papers.

				harry
		what have we got here?

	ever-eager, billy steps into the recess.  and -- 

	two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! 

	harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from
	skewering billy's flesh and bone!  he keeps them open, his
	sinews straining.

				harry
		grab the files!

	billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. as he
	steps out of range. harry lets go and the gates close with a
	clang!

				billy
		jesus!

	he slams the files down.  he's trembling.

				billy
		i could have lost my fucking hands.

				harry
		that would have kept you out of the
		magic circle.
			(he studies the files)
		which was presumably the idea.
			(a beat)
		these are about nix.

	harry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to billy.

				harry
		you go through these.  go on!

	reluctantly, billy does so.  harry picks up a faded
	photograph of the doorway to nix's house (with the sigil
	painted on it) and butterfield the child standing in the sun. 
	there are other cultists standing around.  and in the doorway
	-- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for
	that) - is nix.

				harry
		wait a minute...

	he stares at the boy's face.  the eyes are clearly different
	colours.

				harry
		that's butterfield...

				billy
			(points to nan in)
		doorway)
		and who's that?

	on harry, staring at the ambiguous presence. 

	on the photograph of the shadowy figure.

				harry
		at a guess?  the puritan.  nix.

	billy picks up an etching, water-stained and dirty.  it shows
	a horror we recognize:  a man's hand pressed into the flesh
	of another man's head.

				billy
		take a look at this.

				harry
			(looking at it)
		a nix specialty?

	billy is getting subtly spooked now.  he puts the etching
	down and starts to go through others in the series.  we
	glimpse them as he does so.  in one, a man regurgitates a
	serpentine form made of flame.  in another, a man stares at
	his own hand which is stripped of flesh.  there is no bone
	beneath.  only a form of solid blackness.  in a third, we see
	a head with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating
	darkness.

				billy
		i don't know any of these tricks...

	harry studies the etchings.

				harry
			(a slow burn)
		maybe they're not tricks.

				billy
			(mystified)
		i mean, there's no instructions--
			(realizes what harry said)
		what do you mean, they're not
		tricks?

				harry
		what did vinovich say? something
		about walking a path between --

				billy
		trickery and divinity.  yeah, he
		says that all the time.

				harry
		that's because he knew.  he'd seen
		these files and knew.

				billy
		knew what?

	out of the corner of his eye. harry sees a motion between the
	book-stacks.  billy frowns.  harry puts his fingers to his
	lips.  gestures for billy to take cover. billy backs away. 
	harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. 

	something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  a
	figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed.

	harry takes out his gun. 

	billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. harry
	goes after the apparition. 

	the track is completely silent. 

	suddenly, the creature appears behind billy!  it looks up,
	its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. 

	it tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for billy, who
	backs away.

				billy
		harry!

	books tumble on top of billy as he stumbles against the
	shelves.

				billy
		where the fuck are you?

	harry appears, and puts his gun to the psycho's head.

				harry
		okay.  hold it right there.

	the gun goes through the psycho's skull, as though it's made
	of smoke. 

	harry waves his hands through it.  it's completely ethereal. 

	but it's still terrorizing billy.

				billy
			(in mortal terror)
		get it off me!

	harry glances around.  sees a light flickering between some
	books.  fires at it.  the light goes out.  the "psycho"
	vanishes.  billy is left hyper-ventilating on the ground.

				harry
		hokey enough for you?

				billy
		i'm out of here, man!  are you
		coming?

	harry picks up a handful of papers from the nix file.

				harry
		i'm coming.

	billy is already out of the room.  for a moment. harry pauses
	to look back at the other files, sealed behind the spiked
	gates. 

	as he does so --

	-- the proiector sparks into life one last time, and the
	"psycho" appears --roaring - at harry's shoulder.

				harry
		ah, shaddup!

	he fires at the projector a second time.

	on the gun shot --

				cut to:
