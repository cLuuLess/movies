	ext. nix's grave - might

	swann goes to the graveside, terrified.

				harry
		give me a hand.  i got valentin.

	together, harry and swann lift valentin out of the grave and
	lay him in the blaze of the headlamps.

				valentim
		he's got dorothea. 

				swann
		and nix?

				valentin
		him too.

				harry
		shut up.  we've lost enough lives
		already.

	he puts his foot beneath valentin's body.  it rolls back into
	nix's grave.

				swann
		that's where we're all going.

				harry
		in my time, and nobody else's.

	on the empty grave, as we hear the sound of harry and swann
	getting into the car.  the doors slam.  the car lights
	retreat.  the grave is left to darkness.
