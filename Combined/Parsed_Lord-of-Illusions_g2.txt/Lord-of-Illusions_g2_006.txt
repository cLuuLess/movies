	int. nix's house - meditation room - day

	a dozen cultists sit cross-legged on the floor in front of
	their leader, william nix.  his black hair grows to his
	shoulders.  his eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
	seductive.  a terrifying yet charismatic presence. 

	all the cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
	wear the same simple t-shirts, painted with the cult's sigil. 
	they watch nix in adoration. 

	as nix speaks, he juggles a flame, passing it from hand to
	hand with casual ease...

				nix
		and the fire said to me:  nix, nix,
		you're my instrument. from now on,
		you'll be called the puritan...

				cultists
			(murmuring)
		puritan...

	nix you will find a few good men and women, and together,
	together you will cleanse the world.

				cultists
		yes...

	butterfield enters. 

				butterfield
		master?

	nix looks up.

				butterfield
		swann's here. 

	nix rises, smiling.

				nix
			(to cultists)
		we'll come back to this. get about
		your business. 

	as the cultists disperse, nix and butterfield exit into
