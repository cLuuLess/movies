	int. nix's house - sanctum - night

	harry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  swann follows. 
	he is frozen by the memory of what happened here. 

	on swann, as the track fills with eerie echoes of that
	terrible event.  nix's screams.  the gun-shots.  the sound of
	the screws grinding into nix's flesh.

				swann
			(in terrified awe)
		this is where we killed him.

				harry
			(looking at table)
		you didn't try hard enough.

				swann
		i can't... i can't go any
		further...

	harry nods, and gently detaches his arm from swann's panicked
	grip.  he crosses to the door. 

	suddenly. butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and
	catches hold of harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. 

	he has one of the instruments in his hand.  he stabs at
	harry, striking the ground between harry's legs.
