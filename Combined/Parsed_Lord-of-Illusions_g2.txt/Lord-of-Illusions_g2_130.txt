	int. butterfield's sedan - night       

	valentin drives.  butterfield and dorothea are in the back. 
	dorothea is handcuffed. 

	he has a bag open at his feet.  one by one he takes out a
	series of extraordinary instruments.  dorothea looks on,
	confounded.

				butterfield
		like the look of these?  i made
		them myself, to set him free.

				dorothea
		why did you wait so long?

				butterfield
		i didn't have the skill to
		resurrect him.  i had to teach
		myself.  and that took time.

				dorothea
		and you think he'll be in a fit
		state to resurrect, after thirteen
		years?

				butterfield
		if he was just a man like me, then
		no.  but he's not.

				dorothea
		what is he?

				butterfield
		maybe he'll show you.

	on dorothea, terror in her eyes.
