	int. nix's house - sanctum - day

	pan up from the twitching baboon corpse to swann as he
	struggles with the girl's gag.  he has laid his gun on the
	ground beside her.

				swann
		you're going to be okay.

	out of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings
	round.  nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque
	altarpiece. 

	the girl sees nix over swann's shoulder.  terror crosses her
	face.  swann turns.

				nix
		i knew you'd come. 

	he reaches down to swann.

				nix
		i've got so much power to give
		you, swann.  all you have to do
		is...beg.

				swann
		fuck you.

				nix
		you don't think i've got it to
		give?

				swann
		no!

	suddenly. nix swoops down on swann. apparently defying
	gravity.

				nix
		you're wrong.

	he catches hold of swann with one hand and drives him back
	against the wall.

				nix
		i could eat your fucking soul,
		swann.
