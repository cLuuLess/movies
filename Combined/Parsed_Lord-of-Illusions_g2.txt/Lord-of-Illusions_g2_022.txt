	int. nix's house - sanctum - day

	on nix, doing just that:  rising up.  right hand clamped to
	his bloody chest, left hand reaching for swann.

				nix
		help me!

	quaid fires at him again. strikes his shoulder.  and again. 
	strikes his leg.  nix collapses to the ground,

				jennifer
		quickly!

	they have come prepared for this.  swann now takes from his
	jacket the three strange pieces of metalwork.  there are
	screws in then all.

				nix
			(seeing)
		swann?  what are you doing?

				swann
		binding you.

	he clamps one of the pieces over nix's eyes.  it fits like an
	eyeless mask.  nix thrashes and screams.  swann lays his
	hands on the side of the mask, and  like magic -- his touch
	makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into
	nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching sound.  blood runs
	from the screw-holes.

				nix
		fuck you, swann!  fuck you!

	now the second piece, over his mouth.

				nix
		sw

	he's silenced.  the piece screws itself into-his head, like
	the first.  and now comes the third and final piece:  over
	the nose and into the ears.  again, it screws itself into
	place. 

	swann has done all he can.  he retreats from nix's body, as
	it continues to convulse.  we go from face to ashen face, as
	each man and woman watches and waits.  why won't he die? 

	and now, at last  the violence of nix's death-throes
	diminishes.  nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the
	ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.

				girl
			(quietly)
		is it finished?

				swann
		it's finished.
