	int. swann's mansion - casket room - night

	the room is a museum of swarm's career.  posters, and
	memorabilia everywhere.  and in the middle of the room,
	swann's sealed casket, surrounded by flowers and candles. 
	dorothea is standing beside it, head bowed.

		this is the way he wanted it... no
		autopsy, no embalming. nobody
		meddling with his body...

	harry approaches, slowly.

				dorothea
		flesh is a trap.  that's what he
		used to say.  flesh is a trap and
		magic sets us free.
			(a beat)
		why did you come back?

				harry
		i didn't leave.  i was just digging
		around.

	dorothea looks up at him.

				dorothea
			(uneasy)
		what did you find?

				harry
		jennifer desiderio, for one.
			(he watches her for a
		response)
		she threw herself in front of a car
		this afternoon.

	dorothea can't disguise her distress.

				dorothea
		oh christ.

				harry
			(a beat)
		why don't you tell me the truth?
