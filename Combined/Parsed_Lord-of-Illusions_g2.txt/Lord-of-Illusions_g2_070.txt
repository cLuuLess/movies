	int. magic shop - day

	a wonderland for illusionists.  books, props, masks, tricks,
	etc.  two or three customers browse.  harry glances at them
	all, then targets a man in late middle age, who is browsing
	through books, one-handed.  his other hand constantly
	manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen
	ways.  he doesn't even look at his hand.  his name is walter
	wilder. 

	harry stands beside him.  scans the shelf.

				harry
		where'd you learn that?

				wilder
		what?

				harry
			(points)
		that.

				wilder
		at birth.  i don't know you --

				harry
		harry d'amour.

				wilder
		i know all the kids coming up. got
		to stay ahead of the game. but i
		don't know you.

				harry
		i'm in from new york.  i came to
		see swann.

				wilder
		what a tragedy.  it was just a
		matter of time, of course, but it's
		not good for the business.

				harry
		was he taking a lot of risks?

				wilder
		you don't know the half of it. i'm
		walter wilder, by the way.

				harry
		not the walter wilder? 

	walter beams.

				wilder
		the one and only. 

	he hands harry a card.

				wilder
		want to try?

	harry tries to emulate wilder's card manipulation through the
	rest of this conversation.

				wilder
		you know vinovich?

				harry
			(not a clue)
		sure.  vivovich.

				wilder
		he knew swann way back.  he says
		there were a lot of drugs, a lot of
		crazy shit.

				harry
		i'd love to... you know... hang
		with some of you guys.

				wilder
		people are pretty cagey.  who do
		you know?

				harry
		for what?

				wilder
		for an introduction.

				harry
		well... nobody.

	wilder takes a moment to assess harry, who is attempting to
	manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude.

				wilder
			(magnanimously)
		you do now.
