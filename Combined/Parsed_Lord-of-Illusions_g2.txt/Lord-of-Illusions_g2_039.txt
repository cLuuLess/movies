	int. butterfield's apartment - night

	the rooms are spartan.  nothing on the walls.  nothing on the
	floors.  very little furniture. 

	butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his
	long hair.  there is something feminine about him now:  his
	voice a whisper, his stare distracted.  if we didn't guess it
	already, we're in the presence of a madman. 

	miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of glass
	out of his torso.  it hurts, but he's enjoying himself.

				butterfield
		d'amour... d'amour... why do i know
		that name?

				miller
		i know him.  i saw him.

	he stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass,
	sighing with pleasure.

				miller
		i saw him on t.v.  some kid got
		possessed and he saved the little
		bastard's life.

				butterfield
		he's a priest?

				miller
		no.  he's just a guy who's got a
		nose for this shit.
			(a beat.  a smirk)
		like you.

	a long beat of silence.  butterfield combs.  miller digs for
	glass.

				butterfield 
		i don't want him getting in the
		way.

				miller
		he won't. 

	another silence.

				butterfield
			(dreamily)
		we've all of us waited too long to
		have the homecoming spoiled.

				miller
		what do you mean, "all of us?"

				butterfield
		you didn't think it was just going
		to be you and me?  a lot of people
		believed in nix. they haven't
		forgotten his promise.

				miller
		about?

				butterfield
		death.

				miller
		what about death?

				butterfield
			(a beat)
		it's an illusion.
