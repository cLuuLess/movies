	int. nix's house - sanctum - day

	swann steps inside.  nix's chair has its back to him. the
	folds of nix's robe are visible, however.  swann hears a
	muffled sobbing from the far side of the room. 

	on the girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth.

	swann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  as
	he approaches the chair - the baboon leaps at him screeching!

	he reaches for his gun.  the chair topples.  the baboon, half
	dressed in nix's robes, bounds towards swann. 

	swann fires at it.  the bullet blasts off half its head.
