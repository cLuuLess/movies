	int. nix's house - passageway - night

	the fight between butterfield and harry continues.

				swann (v.o.)
		harry!  stop him!

	harry looks up.  sees dorothea retreating from the door, and
	running off into the darkness. 

	butterfield comes at harry again.  harry's got no more time
	for this creep.  he delivers butterfield a backhand swipe,
	and butterfield lands face down in the glass.  we don't see
	the impact.  hearing it's enough. 

	harry looks down at the body.  then --

				nix (v.o.)
		where is she? 

	harry turns.

	nix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on butterfield's
	body as he comes at harry!

				nix
		where did she go?

	nix grabs hold of harry's head with one hand and presses the
	fingers of -the other hand against harry's temples. he
	struggles to get free, but nix is simply too powerful.

	nix's fingers slowly slide beneath the skin of harry's
	temples.  as before, there's no blood.

				nix
		you've got swann's disease. you
		think a little courage, a little
		love, and it'll all be all right. 
		wrong!

	his fingers slide all the way in!

				harry
		oh god!

	harry wrests himself free of nix, and stumbles away. his eyes
	are blood-red.  nix is a few yards behind him.

				nix
		tell me where she is... and i'll
		make it go away...

	harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare.

	harry's p.o.v.

	the apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  a face
	screams!  fire blossoms! 

	on harry, verging on insanity.

				harry
		oh god... oh god...

	harry's p.o.v.

	harry sees a woman, wrapped in the sickly-sensual embrace of
	some glistening, barely visible obscenity.  we can't see her
	face.  only her mouth is visible in the coils of her
	devourer.

	on harry

	as he approaches the wall, on which this woman is painted. 
	reaching out for the image.

	harry's p.o.v.

	the woman reaches for harry.

				woman           
		help me.

	on harry

	as he touches the wall.

				harry
		dorothea!

	he starts to scratch out the plaster on which the image is
	painted.

				harry
		dorothea!  dorothea!

	harry's p.o.v.

	darkness swallows the image of the woman.  she is still
	screaming when she disappears.
