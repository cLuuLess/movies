	int. st. luke's sanitorium - corridors and ward - day

	toffler excorts harry through -the place.  there are
	distressing scenes on every side.  nothing melodramatic no
	screaming, no fits.  just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. 
	blank, empty faces in blank, empty rooms.

				toffler
		jennifer's been with us four years. 
		she was coming on nicely. 
		but just the last month or so,
		she's worse than ever.

				harry
		what's her problem?

				toffler
		she has no real grip on reality.

				harry
			(a joke)
		does anybody?

				toffler
			(deadly serious)
		oh yes.  we have to agree what's
		real and what's not. that's what
		holds us together.

				harry
		and what does jennifer think's
		real?

	they've come to french windows, which are wide open. sitting
	outside in the sun is jennifer, with her back to us.

				toffler
			(quietly)
		jennifer thinks the devil's coming
		for her.
			(louder)
		jennifer?

	jennifer turns.  she looks terrible.
