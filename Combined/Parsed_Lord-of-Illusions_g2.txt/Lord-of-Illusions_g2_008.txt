	ext. nix's house - desert - day

	the two vehicles come to a halt outside nix's house.

	from the thunderbird steps philip swann, a nineteen- year-old
	with shoulder-length hair and brilliant blue eyes.  he's not
	conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. 

	from the passenger seat steps caspar quaid, a black man,
	studious and intense.  from the bus emerges murray pimm,
	skinny and jittery, and jennifer desiderio, a woman with a
	steely gaze.

				swann
			(to all three)
		are we ready?

				jennifer
			(cool)
		say the word.

				pimm
			(very nervous)
		look, maybe we should think this over.

	on swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces
	of metalwork.  we get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as
	he slips them into his pocket.

				swann
		no.  he's gone too far.

				pimm
		so he took a child.

				jennifer
		he'll kill her.

				pimm
		no he won't.

				swann
			(determined)
		he's not going to get the chance.

	quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.

				quaid
		if he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.

				swann
		so stay out here.

	swann starts towards the house.  jennifer is the first to
	follow, with the other two on her heels.
