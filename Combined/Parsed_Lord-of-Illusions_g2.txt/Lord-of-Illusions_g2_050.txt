	int. swann's mansion - lobby - day

	valentin is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in swann's
	collection:  a huge, framed poster from a late nineteenth
	century magic spectacular.  valentin is fifty or so, his gray
	hair combed back close to his scalp. immaculately dressed in
	a distinctively european fashion.  precise.  cautious. 
	elegant. 

	he orders the two picture-hangers in a clipped fashion.

				valentin
		higher.  another inch.  the left
		hand side's too low.

	dorothea descends the stairs, dressed for the day.

				dorothea
		valentin?

				valentin
			(to hangers)
		good.  there.
			(to dorothea)
		yes?

				dorothea
			(gives him the newspaper)
		you saw this?

	valentin nods.  they walk back through the house together,
	while the picture-hanging goes on behind them.

				dorothea
		i want you to find this man d'amour
		for me.

	she passes the newspaper to valentin.  he looks down at it.
	on newspaper.
