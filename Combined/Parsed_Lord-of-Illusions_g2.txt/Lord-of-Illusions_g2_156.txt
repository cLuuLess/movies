	int. nix's house - meditation room - night

	on nix, dorothea clasped close to him.  he revolves as he
	floats over the chasm below then.

				nix
			(to unseen cultists)
		you see, i escaped the grave. so i
		have to give something to the grave
		in return.

	on the cultists, listening to their lord with love in their
	eyes. 

	a slit opens in the middle of nix's forehead, above the
	bridge of his nose (this is an image we saw in the prints in
	the library), and from it comes a wave of darkness.  as nix
	revolves, the darkness strikes the ground around the
	cultists.

	at first they don't realize what's going on.  they think this
	is some kind of bizarre blessing. 

	then the ground starts to liquify beneath them.

				norman
		what's happening?

				nix
		i have to give something back. so
		i'm giving you.

	they're starting to scream now as they sink into the ground. 
	they struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry
	for them.  they are dragged down, thrashing as they sink.

				barbara
			(sobbing)
		why?  why?

				nix
		you're not worthy.  none of you. 
		only swann was worthy. you just
		waited like lambs.

	harry appears in the doorway.  nix, still swinging round, has
	his back to harry.

				nix
		well i'm not your shepherd.

	harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  the ground
	is now re-solidifying around the cultists, some of whom have
	disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up
	out of the dirt.  the scene has a surreal beauty to it
	despite its horror.  screaming faces locked in the solid
	ground.  twitching hands the same. harry starts towards nix
	and dorothea, gun levelled.  so far, he has avoided nix's
	gaze.
