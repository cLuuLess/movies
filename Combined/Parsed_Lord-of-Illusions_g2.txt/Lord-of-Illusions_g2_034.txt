	ext. quaid's offices - silverlake - night

	in neon blue and purple, a sign blazes in a store window.  it
	reads:  tarot card and crystal readings - $15 special

	on tapert, as he hurries across the street, and through the
	door beside the store window. 

	we pan off the door as harry's car comes to a halt on the far
	side of the street. 

	harry gets out of the car.  stares at the sign in the window,
	puzzled.

				harry
		superstitious?

	he starts across the street.  suddenly:

				tapert (v.o.)
		oh my god!

	tapert emerges, his face white with terror.  he stumbles to
	his car, and he's away.  harry freezes, caught between the
	need to follow tapert and sheer curiosity. he gives in to the
	latter, and steps inside.
