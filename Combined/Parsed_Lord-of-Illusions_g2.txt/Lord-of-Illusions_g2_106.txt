	int. swann's mansion - casket room - night     

	the fire follows him across the ground and strikes his hand. 
	harry drops the gun.  looks up to see the stranger in the
	doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  but then,
	he hesitates.  harry glances round, and sees that the
	stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at
	the casket.

				harry
		somebody you know?

	dorothea appears behind the stranger.  sees harry, burned and
	sweating, cornered against the casket.

				dorothea
		oh my god!

	the stranger looks round.  harry snatches up the gun,
	supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  levels the
	gun at the stranger.  the fire raises its head, like a cobra.

				harry
		which goes first?  my face or
		your heart?

	the stranger draws a deep breath.  the fire-serpent withers
	and dies.

				dorothea
		who in god's name are you?

	she reaches for the stranger, who simply folds up again; gone
	into darkness.  the wind blows through the house, masking his
	exit.

				dorothea
		are you all right?

				harry
		find valentin!  find him!  get him
		in here!

	dorothea disappears.  harry takes one of the candle-holders
	and jams it under the casket lid.  wood splinters.  he starts
	to force off the lid. 

	valentin and dorothea enter.

				valentin
		what are you doing?  this is
		sacrilege.

	he starts towards harry.  dorothea goes after him and catches
	hold of his arm.  her expression is a mingling of fascination
	and dread, as harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and
	pulls. 

	inside, swann's corpse.

				valentin
		are you satisfied now?

				harry
		no.

	harry holds valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger
	into the corpse's mouth.

				dorothea
		harry?

				harry
		it's all right.  it's not
		hurting...

	he now has four fingers in swann's mouth and seizes hold of
	his lower jaw.  it cracks -- 

	-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.

				harry
		...plaster doesn't bleed.

	he tosses the jaw to valentin.

				harry
			(to dorothea)
		it looks like you're not a widow
		after all.
