	quaid levels his gun at butterfield, who is guarding the
	sanctum door.  jennifer is at quaid's side.

	butterfield shakes his head.  quaid fires.  the bullet.
	strikes the wall beside butterfield's head.  he retreats,
	growling like a rabid animal.  quaid kicks the sanctum door
	open, and enters.
