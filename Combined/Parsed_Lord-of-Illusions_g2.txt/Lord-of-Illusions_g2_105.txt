	harry descends the stairs, buttoning up his trousers (which
	is all he wears).  he has his gun.

		valentin? 

	dorothea appears behind him.

				dorothea
		harry?  wait!

	harry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  across the hall, in
	a passageway, an eerie silhouette.  we can make out no detail
	of clothing or face.

	skull.

		aah!

	harry fires at the figure.  the shadows fold up around the
	stranger like an origami puzzle.  he's gone.

				dorothea
		it's him!  it's nix!

	harry goes out into the passageway.

	leg.  he retreats, the fire racing after him. he makes for a
	door, and flings it open.  he's in --
