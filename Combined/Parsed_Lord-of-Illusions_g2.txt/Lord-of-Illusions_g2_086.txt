	ext. st. luke's sanitorium - grounds - city street - day

	harry and jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the
	nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. throughout
	the scene we hear the sound of earth being dug, which
	steadily gets louder as they walk.

				jennifer
		have we met before?

				harry
		no.

				jennifer
		only i forget.  they give me pills,
		you know, to keep me... even...
		and... i forget things,

				harry
		well, you didn't forget me.  i just
		came because i wanted to know if
		you knew a man called butterfield.

				jennifer
		maybe... i... don't...

				harry
		what about philip swann?

				jennifer
		i knew swann.
			(sudden vehemence)
		he's a fucking liar.

	a workman saunters past, carrying pipes.

				harry
		why's that?

				jennifer
		he said he knew how to protect us. 
		but he didn't know anything.  he
		made us think it was over and done
		with.

				harry
		what is?

				jennifer
			(tears nearing)
		i don't want to think about it. if
		i think about it he'll hear me. 
		he'll find me.

				harry
		swann?

	ahead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole,
	laying pipes.  the camera doesn't focus on this action, but
	we're aware of it.

				jennifer
		i told you.  i don't --

	she stops.  looks ahead of her.  her face is suddenly ashen
	and clammy.  harry follows her gaze to: 

	the hole.  somebody is in it, digging.  earth emerges in
	shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole.

				jennifer (cont'd)
			(screaming)
		god no!  oh god no!

	she backs away from the hole.  the nurse grabs hold of her.

				nurse
		calm down!

	she delivers the nurse a backhand swipe.  the nurse is flung
	back.

				jennifer
		he's not going to get me!

	she races down towards the street.  harry goes after her.

				jennifer (cont'd)
		he's not!  he's not!

				harry
		who's not? 

	he catches up with her.

				jennifer
		nix! nix!

				harry
		is he the puritan?

				jennifer
		yes! yes!

				harry
		and he's dead?

				jennifer
		no.  he's coming back.  he's
		digging his way out!

	the nurse appears behind harry.

				nurse
		i'll take care of her now.

	jennifer struggles in harry's grip.

				nurse
		let go of her, mr. d'amour!

	the nurse breaks harry's hold on jennifer, who slips away
	instantly, racing towards the street.

				harry
		jennifer!

	she scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the
	top.  there's a screech of brakes, then the smashing of
	metalwork and glass.  harry gets to the wall before the
	nurse.  hoists himself up onto it.  looks down.

	harry's p.o.v. of street

	jennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the
	wheels of a car.  the driver is out, and yelling
	incoherently. 

				harry
		jesus.

	he slips back down the wall, and leans against it.

	he looks towards the hole.  the workman has stopped digging. 
	his mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his
	head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from
	a grave.  harry closes his eyes.

				harry
			(very quietly)
		jesus.
