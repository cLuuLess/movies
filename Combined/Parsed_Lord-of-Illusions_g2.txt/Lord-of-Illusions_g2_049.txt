	int. swann's mansion - study - day

	venetian blinds shut out most of the sunlight, but a lamp
	burns on the desk (huge), showing us the furniture (leather),
	the books (innumerable), and the figure of swann, sitting
	behind the desk smoking a cigar.  he's lost some hair and
	some colour over the years, but he still has the same
	hypnotic eyes.

	he studies the l.a. times in front of him.

	on the open page

	"fortune teller brutally murdered," the headline announces. 
	underneath, a photograph of quaid's wrecked room.  we close
	in on the photograph, and catch a glimpse of harry, standing
	looking at the chaos.  camera. moves down to the text
	beneath, and on to the name "harry d'amour." 

	on swann, pensive as he studies the paper.

				dorothea (v.o.)
			(softly)
		hey... 

	he looks up, startled.

	dorothea the sun's shining out there. dorothea is dressed in
	a white robe now.  she literally brings light into this
	gloomy room.  on the shelves behind swann are a number of art
	brut figurines, vaguely recalling the idols outside nix's
	"temple."

				dorothea
		bad show last night?

				swann
			(wearily)
		the usual.  full house. standing
		ovation.  i tell them it's magic...

				dorothea
			(distastefully)
		... they believe you.

				swann
		yeah.
			(a beat)
		remember quaid?

				dorothea
		sure.

				swann
		somebody killed him.

				dorothea
		oh god.

				swann
			(disturbed)
		i just saw him.

	a difficult silence.  then swann crosses to the door.

				swann
		i'm putting in a new illusion
		tonight.  will you be there?

				dorothea
		sure.  you want me to find out
		about quaid?  i mean, the funeral?

				swann
		no.
			(superstitiously)
		i'm not going near him.
