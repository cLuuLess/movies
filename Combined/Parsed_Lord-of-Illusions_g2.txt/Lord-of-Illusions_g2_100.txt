	int. swann's mansion- study-- night-

				harry
		so swann was performing magic. not
		illusions?
			(dorothea nods)
		and what?  you thought he should be
		using it to cure cancer, not making
		millions.

				dorothea
		i told you --

				harry
		too much fame.  yeah, i guess
		that'd turn anybody's head.
		including yours.

				dorothea
		no.

				harry
		you said you weren't with him for
		love.

				dorothea
		i wasn't.

				harry
		 what then?

				dorothea
		i was grateful to him.  i owed him
		my life.  and he loved me. he
		couldn't always show it, but he
		felt it.

				harry
		he thought nix was coming back,
		didn't he?

	dorothea is pouring herself another drink.  the glass slips
	from her hand.  it shatters.  harry goes to help her.  they
	stoop together, very close.  the sexual attraction is almost
	palpable. dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass.

				dorothea
		shit!

	they are very close to each other.

				harry
			(reassuring)
		it's okay.

				dorothea
		no it isn't.  you can't help me.

				harry
			(tenderly)
		i'm here, aren't i?

	he kisses her.  she kisses him back, hard.

				harry
		nothing's going to happen to you.  

				dorothea
			(seductive)
		nothing?

				harry
			(smiles)
		nothing you don't want. 

	they kiss again, passionately.
