	int. nix's house - sanctum - day

	a place of nightmares. hanging from the middle of the ceiling
	is another grotesque sculpture, three times the bulk of a
	large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and
	knotted rope.  it is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
	creaking bulk is not even faintly christian.  it is a
	perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony.

	from the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft
	sobbing.

				nix
		hush...

	nix goes to the girl.  she is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and
	presently in a state of mortal fear.  she sits, bound, in a
	fetal position, her face soaked with sweat and tears, her
	mouth bloodied, her cheek bruised.

				nix
		i said hush.

				girl
		please.  let me go.

	from the opposite corner the screech of nix's pet baboon. 
	nix goes to it.  the animal is large and lethal.

				nix
			(to baboon)
		what is it?

	the baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the girl and baring
	its teeth as it screeches.

				nix
			(to girl)
		i think he's in love.

	he unshackles the baboon.  the animal pads toward the girl,
	trailing its chain.

				girl
		keep it away from me.

	nix catches hold of its chain.  holds it back.  the baboon
	starts screeching again, scrabbling at the girl, its nails
	catching her arms and legs, drawing blood.

				girl
		please... please...

	nix watches her terror dispassionately.

				butterfield
			(also watching, wide-
		eyed)
		want me to shoot swann?

				nix
		you don't like him, do you?

				butterfield
		he wants your magic.

				nix
		maybe.  go fetch him.

	butterfield exits.  nix advances on the girl.

				girl
		what are you going to do?
