	ext. swann's mansion - poolside - day

	the blue water glitters in the noon-day sun.  and a woman --
	her body perfectly proportioned -- glides under the surface,
	emerging at the shallow end, where the housekeeper clemenzia
	is setting a tray on a table.

				clemenzia
		coffee, mrs. swann?

	mrs. swann's name is dorothea.  she is a beautiful and
	sensual woman.

				dorothea
		thank you. 

	she dries off.

				dorothea
		where's mr. swann?

				clemenzia
		in his study.
			(a beat)
		he got something on his mind?

				dorothea
		why?

				clemenzia
		bad mood today.
