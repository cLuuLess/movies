	int. nix's house - passageway - night

	the cultists all face the sanctum door, awaiting instruction.

				nix
		will you suffer to come unto me?

	one by one, the cultists fall to their knees.  we never see
	flesh pierced by broken glass.  but we hear it, and see the
	agony on the cultist's faces.  they start to sob.

	then, nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.

				nix
		i've come back to share the wisdom
		of the grave.  will you hear it?

				cultists
		yes... yes...

				nix
		follow me then.

	he steps out of the doorway.  the cultists let out sobs of
	adoration.  nix locks at dorothea.

				nix
		do i know you, child?

	he reaches for her.  pulls her close to his body. dorothea
	keeps her self-possession; but only just.

				nix
		oh yes... i do, don't i?  no gun
		this time, child?
			(a beat)
		where's swann?

				dorothea
		i don't know where he is.

	nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.


				nix
		he'll come.  we've got unfinished
		business, he and i.

	then he carries her down the passageway to the meditation
	room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the
	wounds he's receiving. 

	the cultists follow.
