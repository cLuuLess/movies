	int. police station - other office - night

	dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall.  harry enters.

				harry
		are they treating you okay?

				dorothea
			(nods)
		i heard what happened.  it looks
		like somebody murdered him.

				harry
		i'm sorry i got into this too late. 
		but if you want me to stick around,
		maybe dig where the cops don't
		look...

				dorothea
		i don't know where you'd start.

				harry
		well... how about some of the other
		illusionists?

				dorothea
		they won't tell you anything.

				harry
		i can be very persuasive.

				dorothea
			(a beat)
		yes.  i think you probably can.
			(another beat)
		we'd need to talk about your fee.

				harry
		forget the fee.  if i find
		butterfield, maybe we'll talk about
		money.  if i don't...
			(he shrugs)
		...my gamble.  either way... i
		get to spend some time... here.

	the way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean l.a., it
	means near -dorothea.  and by the tiny smile on her face,
	it's also plain she knows it.
