	int. magic castle - bar - night

	later.  a drunken vinovich is holding court.  he's in his
	40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and
	fake) middle-european accent.  at the table - besides harry
	and walter - are:  vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend
	laura; an asian-american illusionist called billy who; and
	two of vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown,
	overdressed female illusionist - debra devine - and a thin,
	waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the amazing quentin. 

	in the conversation that follows we go back to harry
	repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.

				vinovich
		it's more than entertainment. we're
		opening people's heads up.  putting
		miracles back into their boring
		little lives.

				billy
		but they're fake miracles.

				vinovich
		houdini believed he had spirit
		guides.

				harry
		you believe that?

				vinovich
		i think we walk a narrow path,
		between... between...

				harry
		heaven and hell?

	vinovich stares hard at harry, trying to figure out whether
	he's being sarcastic or not.

				vinovich
		trickery and divinity.

				harry
		are you saying that sometimes
		the miracles are real?

				vinovich
		no.  i'm saying they were always
		fake.  the saints, the messiahs,
		they were just illusionists.

				harry
		so could you walk on water?

				vinovich
			(deadly serious)
		i could reproduce any miracle
		that's ever been performed, with a
		little preparation.

				harry
		what about swann's miracles?

	the smug smile on vinovich's face dies.  furtive glances are
	exchanged around the table.  only billy who makes a tiny
	smile.

				vinovich
		they weren't worth a damn.

				harry
			(goading)
		i heard he was the best.

				vinovich
		if he was so good why's he so dead?

	vinovich begins to look suspicious.

				harry
		you tell me.  no?  i thought you'd
		maybe have a theory.

				vinovich
		oh, i've got plenty.

				harry
		i'd like to hear them. 

	vinovich rises.

				vinovich
		i'm not saying another word.
			(to wilder)
		you damn fool.  he's a
		journalist.

				harry
		just tell me about swann.  or are
		you too scared?

				vinovich
		he was a freak.  everything he did
		was tainted.

	harry rises.  looks straight at vinovich, unintimidated.

				harry
		with what?

				vinovich
		evil.  he was evil.
			(to laura)
		come on.

	she rises.

				vinovich
			(to the rest)
		say nothing to this man if you wish
		to keep my company.

	he stalks away.  harry calls after him, across a now-
	silenced bar.

				harry
		great accent, by the way.  is it
		brooklyn?

				vinovich
			(pure brooklyn)
		fuck you.
