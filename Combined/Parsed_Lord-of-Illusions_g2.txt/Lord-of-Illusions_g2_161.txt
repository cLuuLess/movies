	int. nix's house - passageway - night

	on harry 

	literally beating his head against the wall!

				harry
		no!  no!  no!

				dorothea (v.o.)
		harry...

	harry stops.  dare he believe this is truly her voice?

				dorothea
		it's not real, harry-

	harry turns around.  dorothea is there.

	harry's p.o.v.

	for a moment, he sees dorothea as she is.

	on harry, relief flooding his face.  then --

	harry's p.o.v.

	-- the image morphs.  dorothea's beauty is replaced by
	primeval muck. 

	on harry, appalled.  dorothea grabs hold of him.

				dorothea
		harry.  listen to me. whatever's
		good between us, believe it.

	harry's face is deathly white, and pouring sweat.  he's
	fighting the delirium.  or doing his best.


				harry
		... oh... god...

				dorothea
		i'm here, harry.

				harry
		...yes?

				dorothea
		yes.

	nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind harry.

				nix
			(to dorothea)
		there you are, child. 

	harry starts to look round.

				dorothea
		don't look.

				harry
		i... have... to.

				nix
		come on, child.  i want swann to
		see you die. 

	harry turns and looks at nix.

	harry's p.o.v.

	nix's face darkens as it morphs.  and the flesh in the middle
	of his brow unfolds, revealing a dark, pulsating third eye.

				nix
			(to harry)
		what are you looking at?

	on dorothea, who has gone to the door of the meditation room
	and now slips inside. 

	on harry, staring up at nix.

	on dorothea, re-emerging from the meditation room.  in her
	hand, harry's gun.  harry looks round at her.

				harry
			(points to his brow)
		there... there!

	on nix, as he looks up at dorothea. 

	on dorothea, as she raises the gun.  she fires. 

	the bullet strikes nix's forehead.  he sinks to his knees,
	blood pouring down his face from the hole where his third eye
	used to be.

	on harry, as nix's mind-hold falters.  he leans against the
	wall, shaking.

				dorothea
		harry?

				harry
		i'm okay.  i'm okay.

	harry opens his eyes.  looks up at her.

	harry's p.o.v.

	the last of the morphing fades.  he sees dorothea as she
	actually is.  dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they
	embrace. 

	suddenly, a roar from nix.  they look towards him --

	-- it isn't over. 

	one last, terrifying transformation is overtaking nix as he
	kneels in the glass.  his sallow flesh is running in streams
	up his body towards the dark hole in the middle of his
	forehead --

				nix
		one... last... illusion...

	-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of
	the bullet wound.

				dorothea
		oh my god.

	harry and dorothea start to get up... 

	nix is no longer human.  he is a shape of gleaming darkness,
	stripped of features.  he opens his mouth, the only visible
	element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an
	utterly inhuman shriek!

				swann (v.o.)
		... d'amour...

	harry glances through the door into the meditation room.
	swann is on the threshold. 

	nix rises now.  he is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk
	somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. 

	he comes at dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into
	the meditation room.
