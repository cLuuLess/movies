	int. nix's house - sanctum - day

				quaid
		swann?

				nix
			(to quaid)
		here he is.

	swann stumbles into the middle of the room, the whites of his
	eyes blood-red.

				nix
		take a look, swann!  these are your
		friends.

	on swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at quaid and
	jennifer.

				jennifer (v.o.)
		what have you done to him? 

swann's p.o.v.

	of quaid and jennifer.  to swann's eyes, their faces seem to
	be morphing.  their humanity is melting away. what's left is
	like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes:  primeval muck.

				quaid (v.o.)
		swann.  it's okay.

	quaid reaches for swann, who retreats in horror, shaking his
	head violently.

				swann
		don't touch me.  he's got... got
		into my head.

				nix
		you want to be like that, swann? 
		mud and shit?

	swann turns away from quaid and jennifer in disgust.

	swann's p.o.v. 

	of nix, his arms outstretched in welcome.  his face has an
	aura of pulsing light.

				nix
		come here.  share the power.

	on a gun, leveled. .we don't see by whom.  the trigger is
	pulled. 

	the bullet strikes nix's back and explodes out of his chest.

	on swann, staring at nix. 

	swann's p.o.v. of nix, as the aura of light dies. 

	just for a moment - a terrible moment - swann glimpses
	something else. morphing out of nix's features.  a nightmare
	face with waves of darkness emanating from the middle of its
	forehead. 

	swann covers his eyes.

				nix
			(raging, terrifying)
		swann!  swann!

	nix staggers, letting out an ungodly howl, and drops to his
	knees, clutching the wound.  as he falls, he reveals the
	ashen girl, who is still holding swann's smoking gun.

				nix
			(a roar)
		help me!

	swann shakes his head, ridding himself of nix's mind-
	control.
