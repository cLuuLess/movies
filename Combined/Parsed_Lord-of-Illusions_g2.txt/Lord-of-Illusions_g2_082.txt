	int. quaid's offices - waiting/fortune telling rooms - night  

	harry enters, flashlight on.  he crosses the waiting room and
	enters the fortune-telling room where quaid died.  on the
	track -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear quaid's sobs,
	miller's shouts, and, as harry's flashlight illuminates the
	blood-spattered table:

				butterfield (v.o.)
		if you watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping.

	harry is spooked.  he starts to search the room, opening
	cabinets and drawers.  quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac
	are stashed everywhere.  boxes of crystals, religious
	statues, elaborate cards, incense, etc.

	he pulls open a drawer, and notices that a rosary is wedged
	in a niche at the base of the drawer.  he pulls the drawer
	out, empties its contents on the table, and examines it. 

	using the crowbar, he forces the drawer apart.  it has a
	false bottom.

		yes...

	in the secret compartment, some papers and an address book. 
	he flicks to "d."

				harry (cont'd)
		desiderio...

	there it is.  jennifer desiderio, and an address.  he pockets
	the book.  then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out
	his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing --

	-- valentin!

				harry (cont'd)
		what the fuck are you doing here?

				valentin
		looking for you.  i tried the
		hotel.

				harry
		why'd you come here?

				valentin
		you're a detective, with no clues. 
		where else are you going to look? 
		i'm going to keep this brief.
			(he takes out an envelope)
		here's thirty thousand dollars.

				harry
		what for?

				valentin
		a ticket home,

				harry
		you didn't hire me.  she did.
		if she wants me off the job, i
		want to hear it from her.

				valentin
		she doesn't want to see you. she's
		had enough pain.  enough churning
		over the past.  she wants it all
		left alone.

				harry
		left alone?  somebody's been
		murdered.

				valentin
		yes.  it's regrettable

				harry
		fuck regrettable!  i want to know
		why.

				valentin
		what for?  you need to stay busy?

				harry
			(a confession)
		i like to know why things happen.

				valentin
		why people die?
			(shakes his head)
		give it up, d'amour.  go home.

				harry
		no.

	harry crosses to the door, brushing past valentin.

				valentin
		don't try and see her, d'amour.
		just leave her alone.  let her
		heal.

	he glances back at valentin.

				harry
		lock up, will you?
