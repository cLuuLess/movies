	int. nix's house - passageways - night

	we track through the house.  the cultists, all seventeen of
	them, stand in the passageways, looking toward nix's sanctum.

	on the sanctum door.  butterfield emerges.  he is wearing
	white now.

				butterfield
		do you wish him to be amongst us?

				cultists
		yes...

				butterfield
		will you come to him on your
		knees?

				cultists
		yes...

				butterfield
		be ready.

	now we see that the cultists have bottles in their hands. 
	with looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they smash the
	bottles to the ground at their bare feet. then they pick up
	more bottles, and smash them, littering the ground with razor
	sharp pieces of glass. 

	on butterfield, smiling.  he steps back into the sanctum.
