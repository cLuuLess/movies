	int. nix's house - sanctum - night

	on dorothea, eyes wide.

				dorothea
		christ in heaven.

	on nix, as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils. 
	his withered flesh starts to rehydrate; his veins start to
	throb. 

	butterfield is watching the process in amazement. nix's hands
	move up to his face, where the last portion of the mask is
	still screwed over his eyes.

				butterfield
		he's with us...
