	int. quaid's offices - fortune-telling room - night

	a mysterious, candle-lit space.  in the middle of the room, a
	table.  at it sits quaid. thirteen years older. he has been
	tortured close to death.  several small scalpels protrude
	from his chest and neck.  his life is ebbing away.  on the
	table in front of him, a fan of tarot cards, blood-spattered.

	harry races in through the open door from the waiting room.

				harry
		what the fuck!?

	harry picks up the phone.  it's dead.  miller charges at the
	door.

				harry
		shit!

	harry slams the door in miller's face, and locks it. 

	as he does so, the candles flicker.  harry looks up.  a
	figure looms from the darkness behind quaid.  he's in his
	late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. his long
	hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  his mismatched eyes -
	one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is butterfield. 
	his hands are bloody, and he carries one last scalpel.

				harry
			(to butterfield)
		don't touch him."

	butterfield strokes the wounds on quaid's cheek.  quaid sobs
	in pain. 

				butterfield
		what are you going to do about it? 

	miller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the
	other side.  his fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock
	out.  harry doesn't move, or miller will be through.

				butterfield
			(to harry)
		ever watched a man die?  if you
		watch very closely, you can
		sometimes see the soul escaping. 
		and if you're very quick, you can
		catch it.

				quaid
		please... butterfield... i wasn't
		there.  ask pimm.

				butterfield
		pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's
		disappeared.  they knew the puritan
		was coming home. 

	as this exchange goes on, miller pulls the lock out of the
	door and starts to throw himself against it from the other
	side.  it's all harry can do to keep himself from being
	pitched across the room.  he looks around for some means of
	defense.  there's a crack in the drapes to the left of the
	table.  behind it a window.

				butterfield
		so do you.  you've seen the future. 
		haven't you?

				quaid
		yes.

				butterfield
		and are you afraid?

				quaid
		yes.

	suddenly, harry steps aside.  the door's flung open. miller
	charges in.  harry catches hold of his arm, and throws him
	against the drape.  the window cracks; the drape comes down
	around miller.  amber streetlight floods in. 

	butterfield is momentarily distracted.  harry strikes the
	scalpel from his hands. 

	miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the
	folds of the drapes.  harry lands a solid kick to the man's
	belly.  miller is thrown back against the cracked window,
	which shatters.  still wrapped in the drape, he falls out. 

	harry turns back to arrest butterfield, but he's already
	making his escape.  harry starts after him.

				quaid
			(to harry)
		don't leave me.

	he turns back.  tears are pouring down the man's face. harry
	goes back to comfort quaid, as butterfield escapes down the
	stairs.


				harry
		you need an ambulance.

				quaid
			(in pain)
		too late.  why are you here? did
		you cone... up here for a reading? 

	quaid takes hold of harry's hand.

				harry
		no ... i...

	quaid stares at harry's hand.  fascinated, he momentarily
	forgets his pain.  he traces the lines with bloody fingers.

				quaid
			(quietly)
		my god.

				harry
		what?

				quaid
		you've taken some strange
		journeys in your life.

				harry
		yeah.  you could say that.

				quaid
		you're drawn to the dark side, over
		and over.  and it's drawn to you.
			(looks at harry)
		you don't like that.

				harry
		not much.

				quaid
		you can't change it.  you have to
		walk...
			(coughs)
		...walk the line between heaven and
		hell.  it's your destiny.  accept
		it.

	harry takes his hand from quaid's grip.  quaid winces in
	pain.

				harry
		hold on.

				quaid
		i'm not afraid to die.  there's
		something terrible... coming
		home...

				harry
		the puritan?

				quaid
		yes...

				harry
		who is he? 

	quaid shudders, and dies.

				harry
			(softly; sadly)
		shit.

	he looks away, down at the cards.  all have been turned over
	but one.  he turns it.  the card is the ten of swords which
	pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky, pierced by
	all ten swords.  an image of death and desolation.
