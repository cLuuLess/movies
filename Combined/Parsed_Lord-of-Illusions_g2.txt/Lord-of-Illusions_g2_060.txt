	int. wiltern theatre - stage - night

	center-stage, behind the closed curtains, swann is ready for
	the opening of the show.  technicians buzz around him like
	flies.

				swann
		valentin!

	valentin emerges from the wings, patting the panther that is
	waiting there.

				swann
			(irritated)
		valentin!

				valentin

				swann
		the guy with dorothea.  is that who
		i think it is? 

	valentin nods.

	on swann, his expression unreadable.

				swann
		he's young.

	music strikes up.  a dramatic, wagnerian chord. valentin
	hurries away.  swann's expression becomes very focused.

				1st technician

				swann

	swann rises up into the flies.

				1st technician

				2nd technician

				1st technician
