	int. wiltern theatre - auditorium and stage - night

	the lights are dimming.  harry glances across at dorothea,
	whose gaze is intent. 

	the lights go out.  the music swells, and the curtains fly
	apart.  a spectacle worthy of seigfried and roy is about to
	blast our senses!  magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride
	into mystery.

				swann (v.o.)
		ladies and gentlemen.  you are
		standing on the threshold of a
		miracle...

	a vortex of smoke and light swirls in the middle of the
	stage. 

	the vortex blazes -- 

	and suddenly swann sweeps down out of the flies, as the floor
	of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor
	toothed dragon emerges in a cloud of crimson smoke. 

	swann raises his hands above his head and a spear
	miraculously appears in his grasp.  he descends on the
	dragon.  it's a classic image:  st. michael smiting the
	devil.  swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. 
	the theatre shakes at its dying roars.  then the head cracks
	open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily
	dressed dancers, male and female.  swann throws down the
	spear, and where it strikes the stage his panther appears. 

	a roar of applause from the audience.  swann's plain white
	tunic falls away from him as he descends.  by the time his
	feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot tuxedo. 
	the panther licks his hand in welcome. the music comes to a
	crescendo.  the dancers freeze in their erotic dance.  in the
	sudden hush, swann speaks in a whisper.

				swann
		my friends ... come with me...into
		the great beyond.

	a barrage of lights and music erupt. 

	the audience applauds wildly. 

	on harry and dorothea.

				harry
		he's good.

				dorothea
		you haven't seen anything yet.
