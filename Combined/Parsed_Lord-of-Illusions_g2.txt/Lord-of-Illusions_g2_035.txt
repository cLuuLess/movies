	int. quaid's offices - stairwell - night

	an illuminated arrow points up the stairs.  harry ascends,
	past faded photographs of caspar quaid with famous faces.

	at the landing, the passageway turns ninety degrees. harry
	halts, and takes out his gun. 

	there's a strange rumbling sound approaching from round the
	corner.  harry chances a look.  there's a short length of
	passageway, leading to an open door.  from the threshold a
	crystal ball rolls towards harry, blood- smeared.  this is
	the source of the rumbling.  harry stops the ball before it
	falls down the stairs. 

	dead silence.  after a beat, harry creeps towards the open
	door.  he pushes it open.  inside, chaos.  the fake antique
	furniture is splintered, the astral charts slashed.
