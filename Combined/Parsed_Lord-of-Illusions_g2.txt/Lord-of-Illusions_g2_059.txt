	int. wiltern theatre - auditorium - night

	the atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a
	conventional stage show.  security people with walkie-
	talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely
	controlled hysteria. 

	harry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  a star-lit
	curtain covers it.  six rows from the stage is dorothea,
	already in her seat.  she smiles lavishly, happy to see him.

				dorothea
		i'm glad you could make it. 

	harry takes a seat beside her.

				harry
		hey, this is a big deal for me. you
		know what seats like this cost in
		new york?
