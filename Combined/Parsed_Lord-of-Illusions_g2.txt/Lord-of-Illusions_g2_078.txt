	int. swann's mansion - dorothea's bedroom - night

	she sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing
	else, drinking a scotch, talking on the phone. the primary
	source of illumination is the massive t.v. set in the wall
	opposite the bed.

		harry... i know it's late.

	intercut phone conversation

	there should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. 
	both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. each aroused by
	the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and
	touch them.

				harry
		that's okay.

	as he speaks, harry scrawls jennifer desiderio on the title
	page of the gideon's bible beside the bed.

				dorothea
		how did it go today?

				harry
		i went up to the magic castle. you
		were right.  he didn't have a lot
		of fans up there.
