	int. nix's house - various - late afternoon

	we move through the shadowy interior, catching sight of
	several cultists as we go.  they all have looks of barely
	suppressed ecstasy on their faces. 

	we are moving towards the sanctum, and it's getting darker. 
	a match is struck, and an oil-flame sputters into life.  we
	see norman's gleaming face. on the wall is a picture of nix,
	floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. 

	norman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of dirt. beneath,
	nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  norman
	grins.
