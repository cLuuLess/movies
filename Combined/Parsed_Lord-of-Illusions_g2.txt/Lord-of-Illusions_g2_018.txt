	int. nix's house - sanctum - day

	nix has swann trapped against the wall and is working his
	fingers against swann's temples.  working, working, like a
	psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient.

				nix
		you want to know what the world
		really looks like?

	swann struggles, but he can't get free of nix's hold. 

	and now -- horribly -- nix's fingers slide beneath the skin
	of swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt.

				nix
		want to see flesh with a god's
		eyes?

	swann screams as nix's mind-hold seizes him.
