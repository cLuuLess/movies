	ext. melrose restaurant - night

	harry stands, in a shabby doorway across the street from a
	classy restaurant.  it's raining.
	on tapert, a middle-aged, balding man with a very pretty
	woman opposite him, sitting at a table close to the window. 
	tapert makes a joke (unheard).  the woman laughs. 

	on harry, chewing on a hamburger, as he speaks into his tape
	recorder.

				harry
		nine-eighteen p.m.  tapert's either
		got a great sense of humour or he's
		paying her to laugh.
			(looks at hamburger in
		disgust)
		jesus.

	on tapert, as he rises from the table.

				harry
			(into tape recorder)
		he's finished.

	tapert exits the restaurant, and crosses the street. harry
	tosses his half-eaten hamburger away, and goes to his car.
