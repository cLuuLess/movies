	high, wide shot of the room, as butterfield approaches the
	body of nix.  it lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of oil. 
	bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  beside its
	head, butterfield's instruments are laid out. 

	on dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as
	she watches butterfield remove the multi- part mask screwed
	into nix's face.  he works with surgical precision.

				dorothea
		listen.  you've got everything you
		want.  you don't need me. .. 

	a piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  a subtle
	power plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. 
	we cut close to dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on
	occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these
	signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.

				butterfield
		no, but he will.  after what you
		did to him.

	he pulls a piece of the mask from nix's mouth.

				butterfield
		he'll want vengeance.  simple ps
		that.
