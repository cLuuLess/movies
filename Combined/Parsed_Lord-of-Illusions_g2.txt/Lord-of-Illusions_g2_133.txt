	ext. desert - nix's grave - night

	wide.  a few rocks, and emptiness. 

	the headlamps of butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness,
	illuminating the dig.  valentin is in the grave, digging. 

	on butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole,
	watching the work.  dorothea stands a yard or two behind him.

				butterfield
		anything?

				valentin (v.0.)
		not yet.

	butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly
	reaches out for valentin, hauling him close.

				butterfield
		if you've lied to me to me --

				valentin
		i swear... this is the place swann
		told me about.  the rocks...

	on dorothea, who uses butterfield's distraction to take a few
	steps back towards the open car door. 

	dorothea's p.o.v. of butterfield, back to her, interrogating
	valentin.

				butterfield
		five more minutes.  hear me? and
		you'd better not --

	a sound behind him.  butterfield wheels round.  on the ground
	beside the open car door, the instruments.

				butterfield
		what the fuck are you playing at?

	he goes to pick them up.  dorothea steps from behind the
	door, with the sharpest in her hand.  she slashes at him. 
	opens a wound across his arm.

				butterfield
		aah!

	he comes at her suddenly, striking the instrument from her
	hand, and slamming her against the car.  he hits her.  once.
	twice.  then --

				valentin (v.o.)
		butterfield!

	butterfield goes to the edge of the grave, picks up the
	flashlight and trains the beam on valentin.

				valentin
			(blinded)
		in the corner...

	the beam goes to the corner of the grave. 

	a mummified hand is sticking out of one of the walls.

				butterfield
			(to valentin)
		keep away from it.

	butterfield jumps down into the grave, and goes to the hand. 
	the track is silent, but for butterfield's shallow breath. 
	he reaches out to touch nix^s fingers...

	closer... 

	closer... 

	he touches the hand - and the wall of sand comes down with a
	roar!

	he jumps back as nix's corpse, his head still sealed by the
	mask rolls into view.

				valentin
		oh christ!  oh christ!

				butterfield
			(reverentially)
		it's him... it's him.

	on dorothea, sliding down the car in despair.
