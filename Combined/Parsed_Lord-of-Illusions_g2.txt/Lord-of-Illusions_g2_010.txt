	int. nix's house - "meditation" room - day

	quaid looks into a large circular room where five cultists
	(three men and two women) still sit.  one of the women is
	breast-feeding a baby.

				1st man
		hey, quaid.  i thought you said you
		weren't coming back.

				quaid
		i changed my mind.

				1st woman
		come and join us.

	she smiles a crazy smile.  reaches out for quaid.  a snake
	appears from around the back of her neck.  quaid recoils. 

	and now we see that there are snakes everywhere.  in the
	cultists' clothes and hair.  even on the baby.  quaid turns
	away.  and - shock! - there's a snake on the door frame,
	winding around his hand.  he strikes it to the ground, and
	drives his heel down on its head.

				snake-handler cultist
			(angry)
		don't do that!

	the snake-handler gets up.  quaid retreats from the door. 
	snake-handler picks up the dead snake and, lifting it above
	his head, dribbles its blood onto his face.
