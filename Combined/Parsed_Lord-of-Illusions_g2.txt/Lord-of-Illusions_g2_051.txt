	int. harry's hotel room - day

	harry is sprawled on the bed, in his under shorts.  a shaft of
	sun darts between the drapes, missing his face by inches. 

	somebody is knocking on the door, hard.

				harry
			(waking)
		what...?

	he rolls over.  the sun strikes his eyes.  he winces.

				harry

				valentin (v.o.)

				valentin (v.o.)
		it's one in the afternoon.

				harry
		what are you, my mother?

				valentin (v.o.)
		i need to speak to you, mr.
		d'amour.  about last night.

	harry gets up and stumbles to the door.  he opens it a
	little.  the face of valentin is visible through the crack.

				harry
		whatever i said, i didn't mean it,
		okay?  i get a few drinks inside me --

				valentin
		we've never met.

				harry
		then what do you want?

				valentin

			(consults his watch)

		five thousand a day?
