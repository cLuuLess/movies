	ext. nix's .house - wide shot - dusk

	the wind has died away.  it's eerily calm.  butterfield
	dashes towards camera, then halts. 

	he looks back, as nix's killers load his huge, limp corpse
	into the back of murray pimm's bus. 

	on butterfield.  he watches, with a feral look on his face.
