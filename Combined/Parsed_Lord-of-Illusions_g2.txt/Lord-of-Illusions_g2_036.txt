	int. quaid's offices - waiting room - night

	there are two offices.  in the front, a waiting room, into
	which harry now steps.  beyond it, through a door that stands
	narrowly ajar, the fortune telling room. 

	from out of the fortune telling room, a moan.

				quaid (v.o.)
		ahh. . .

	harry crosses the waiting room, reaching into his jacket for
	his gun.  suddenly, a nightmarish figure leaps from the
	shadows. 

	his name is ray miller.  he's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth
	sharpened, eyes wild.  nix's sigil is tattooed on the middle
	of his forehead.  he strikes the gun from harry's hand and
	goes for his throat. 

	harry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's bust
	and smashes it on miller's skull. 

	miller reels back.  harry makes a dash for the door to the
	fortune telling room.

				miller
		fuckhead.
