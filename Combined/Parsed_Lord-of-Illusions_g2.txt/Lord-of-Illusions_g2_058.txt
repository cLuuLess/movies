	ext. wiltern theatre - night

	crane down from a looming standee of swann, perched above the
	theatre marquee.  spotlights rake the skies. the sidewalk
	below is jammed with audience members, star-spotters and
	photographers.  this is a flashy, prestigious event.  limos
	are disgorging scantily- dressed starlets and smiling money
	men; a news team is interviewing audience members as they
	file in. 

	the atmosphere is noisy and excited.  amid the throng, harry. 
	he makes his way inside.
