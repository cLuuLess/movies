	ext. l.a. street - semi-derelict building - day

	a bad neighborhood, to judge by the state of the streets. 
	harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate, topped with
	barbed wire.  he peers through the bars. 

	harry's p.o.v. of the stranger from the funeral disappearing
	into the building.  he glances back towards the street.  we
	get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat. 

	harry slides out of sight.  waits until the stranger has gone
	inside.  then he's up, over the gate, braving the barbed
	wire.
