	int. nix's house - sanctum - night

	unnoticed by butterfield, who has his eyes on nix, dorothea
	gets to her feet and creeps away to the door. very quiet
	track. 

	suddenly, the snake-handling cultist steps into view, snakes
	coiled around his face and fingers!

				dorothea
		oh god!

	butterfield looks up. 

				butterfield
		hold her!

	on nix, as he starts to pull at the mask on his face.  it
	comes away with a moist, wrenching sound.  at last, we see
	his eyes.

	nix's p.o.v.

	the candle-lights blaze, blinding his sensitive eyes.

				nix
			(fury to agony)
		aaarrrgh!

	he gets up and flings himself around the room, knocking over
	all the lights but two.  then he strikes butterfield to the
	ground, and slams his foot on butterfield's neck, knocking
	him unconscious.  it's a terrifying, almost demoniacal
	display of instant physical superiority.  throughout, he
	literally roars in rage.
