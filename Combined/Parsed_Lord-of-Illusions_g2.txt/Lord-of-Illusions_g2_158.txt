	int. nix's house - meditation room - night

	harry is staring up at dorothea as he very gingerly crosses
	the still-sticky ground.  he's a yard from the edge of the
	pit now. 

	nix swings round.

				nix
		you're not swann.  who are you?
			(a beat) )
		oh... i know what you want. he lets
		dorothea slip from his arms.  

	harry flings himself towards the hole and catches hold of
	dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  his gun
	goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door
	leading to the passageway.

				dorothea
		oh god!

				harry
		hang on!

	nix reaches down to torment harry.  but before he can make
	contact

				swann (v.o.)
		nix!

	nix looks up.

				nix
		there you are. 

	suddenly, nix isn't interested in harry and dorothea. he
	steps onto solid ground, and walks towards swann, his tone
	suddenly conversational.

				nix
		i've had a lot of time to think
		about you.  where i went wrong...

	with nix's back turned, harry pulls dorothea back out of the
	chasm.

				swann
		and?

				nix
		i should have been honest with you,
		right from the start.  i wasn't
		born to show people the error of
		their ways.  i was born to murder
		the world.

	on harry, as he leads dorothea to the door.  harry glances
	back into the room.

				nix
		you could still help me do that.

				swann
		why would i want to?

				nix
		because you've got nothing else to
		live for.

				swann
		not true.

				nix
		the woman has a new love in her
		life.  your friends are dead.
		nobody's left to save you, but me

	he lays his hands on swann.  draws him into an embrace.

	on harry and dorothea.

				harry
			(to dorothea)
		i've got to help him.

				dorothea
		you can't.

				harry
		nix has got to have a weak spot. 
		everybody's got a fucking weak
		spot.

	a noise. he turns, and suddenly --

	butterfield is there!  his face is horribly burned, but he's
	still very much alive.

				butterfield
		bastard!

	he launches himself at harry, driving them both back into the
	broken glass.  a fight ensues, carrying them out into the
	passageway. 

	nix has swann in a bear-hug.

				nix
		will you help me? 

	a beat.  then swann nods.

				swann
		yes.

	nix lets him go.

				nix
		you know i'll kill you when we're
		done.  i have to.

				swann
		yes.

				nix
		but until then... it's you and
		me... the way it always was.

				swann
		yes.

	dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange.
	swann's eyes flicker towards her.  nix turns.

				nix
		wait... you still feel something
		for that bitch?

				swann
		no!

				nix
		liar!

	nix makes a gesture, and swann is flung against the wall,
	pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.

				nix
		will!  you!  never!  learn!?

	with each word, nix almost casually throws a gesture in
	swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them,
	they have the force of terrible blows.  one to the ribs. 
	they crack.  one to the face.  it bleeds.  one to the legs,
	one to the arms.  they all break.  then nix turns towards
	dorothea.

				nix
		she's just flesh, swannnie-boy.
		i'll show you!

	he moves towards dorothea.  swann falls to the ground,
	broken.

				swann
		harry!
