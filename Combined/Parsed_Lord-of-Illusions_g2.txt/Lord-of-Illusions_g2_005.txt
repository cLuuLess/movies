	int. nix's house - rooms and corridors - day

	the house no longer serves any domestic function.  it has
	become the temple and dormitory of nix's small apocalyptic
	cult.  as we go through the house with butterfield we glimpse
	a little of what life here is like. 

	the rooms are murky, and chaotic.  the walls, painted with
	scenes of cities and landscapes burning, and creatures from
	some unspeakable nightmare attacking, raping, and devouring
	helpless humanity.  the atmosphere is joyless, and
	oppressive. 

	the passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
	way to the heart of the house.  only oil lamps, set on the
	floor, light these claustrophobic corridors.
