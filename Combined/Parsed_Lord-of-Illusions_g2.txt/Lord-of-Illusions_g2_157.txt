	int. nix's house - sanctum - night

	butterfield and swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. 
	they tumble back against the table upon which nix was
	resurrected.  it collapses under them, and for a moment swann
	is stunned.  butterfield snatches up one of the instruments
	and stabs at swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of
	time. 

	the blade catches him in the arm, however.

				swann
		aah!

				butterfield
		go on, bleed.
			(he slashes at swann
		again)
		go on!  go on!

	butterfield comes after him, and swann backs off against a
	wall.  he spits out a serpentine flame, which races across
	the floor and leaps at butterfield's face!

				butterfield
			(screaming)
		no!

	he falls backwards, his face on fire.  swann doesn't wait to
	watch him die, but races out into the passageway, blood
	running from his wound.
