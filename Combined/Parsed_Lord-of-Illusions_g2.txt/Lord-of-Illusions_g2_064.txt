	int. wiltern theatre - stage - night

	chaos.  people running, sobbing, puking; some simply standing
	watching.  valentin is already at the body, with the stage
	manager at his side.

				valentin
			(to stage manager)
		get then out of here, for god's
		sake --

				stage manager
		you heard him!  it's not a fucking
		show!

	he starts to physically push the crowd back.  harry grabs his
	arm.

				stage manager
		who are you?

	harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the stage
	manager out of dorothea's way.  she goes to swann's body,
	which has been removed from the wheel.
