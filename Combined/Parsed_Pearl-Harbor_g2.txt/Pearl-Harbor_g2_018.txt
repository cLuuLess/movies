	ext.  train station - dawn

	danny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the
	station.  he takes the one on the far right.  as he passes
	through it, he doesn't see evelyn rushing through the door on
	the left side.  she's told herself she wouldn't come, but
	couldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the
	train disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits
	her.

	she stands on the empty platform, as lonely as rafe.

	montage - the journeys

	rafe and evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward
	opposite ends of the earth...
