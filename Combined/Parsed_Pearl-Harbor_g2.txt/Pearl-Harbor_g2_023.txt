	ext.  bassingborne airfield - britain - dusk

	in the eternal dusk of england, everything is cold and gray.
	british fighter planes -- spitfires and hurricanes -- are
	surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled
	fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines.
	rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag.
	he moves up behind a slim, pale british air commander who is
	surveying engine damage on one of the spitfires.

					rafe
			rafe mccawley, sir.

	rafe salutes as the air commander turns and then returns the
	salute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone.  rafe
	freezes at the sight, reminded of danny's father.

					british air commander
			on loan from colonel doolittle, is it?

					rafe
			that's me, sir.

					british air commander
			good on you, then, rafe mccawley.  we'll
			get you situated in some quarters, and
			then introduce you to the equipment
			you'll be flying.

					rafe
			if you're patching up bullet holes right
			here on the runway, maybe we should skip
			the housekeeping and get right to the
			planes.

					british air commander
			are all the yanks as anxious as you are
			to get yourself killed, lieutenant?

					rafe
			not anxious to die, sir, anxious to
			matter.
