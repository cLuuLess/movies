	ext.  shore of pearl harbor - night

	rafe stares out at the harbor, seeing nothing.  as he stands
	there alone and shattered, he has one more

	subliminal flashback

	rafe is in the water of the north sea; he seems dead, but his
	makeshift preserver is keeping his face above the surface.
	something slides through the water and stops beside him; it's
	a dinghy, and behind it is a trawler.

	hands grab rafe and drag him onto the dinghy...

	in a quick cut, rafe's body is laid out on the deck of the
	trawler.  the crewmen think he's dead.  his body is stiff,
	his lips white; and they say so, in norwegian...

	but one of the other crewmen notices a quiver in his eyelid,
	then quickly covers rafe with his on wool peacoat and presses
	back an eyelid to see his pupils.  rafe's white lips move.
	the crewmen realize he's trying to say something.

	and rafe does utter something, barely audible; something the
	norwegian crewmen don't understand.

					rafe
			evelyn...

	in the present rafe struggles to bury that memory so far that
	he'll never feel it again.
