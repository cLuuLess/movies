	a fire engine from the honolulu fire department races up to
	the sight of buildings burning from the air attack.  as the
	firemen jump out, a zero strafes them, gunning down the
	firemen.

	as the strafing zero starts to bank away, two p-40's come in
	behind it, both of them gunning away.  the zero comes apart
	under the barrage, and crashes in a ball of flame.

	it's rafe and danny, back in the air.
