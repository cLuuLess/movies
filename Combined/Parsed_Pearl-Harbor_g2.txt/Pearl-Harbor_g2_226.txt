	ext.  hickam field - day

	the wrecked planes have been pushed off the runway and lie in
	piles.  a transport plane is fueling, and rafe and danny wait
	in the shade of a shelter.

					danny
			i told her not to come.

	the major, watching the fueling, gets a wave from the ground
	crew and turns and motions to rafe and danny that they're
	ready.  they pick up their duffel bags -- and then evelyn
	comes around the corner of the shelter.

	rafe sees her first, but stops and looks away as danny moves
	to her.  for a moment he studies her eyes, and she does not
	look away.

					danny
			this hasn't been easy for any of us.  i
			feel awful for how it's happened.  but
			i've seen my first spring too.  thanks
			for knowing that's true.

	he takes her into his arms, kisses her tenderly but briefly,
	a final time.  evelyn's eyes find rafe, but he can't look at
	her until the embrace is over.

	rafe and danny move to the plane and hurry up the steps.
	they turn before the door closes and wave to her.

	evelyn's still standing there as the plane lifts away.
