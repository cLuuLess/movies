	ext.  white house - day

	the entire washington press corps is waiting, with fresh
	bulbs in the flash attachments of cameras that are already as
	big as a shoe box.  the president is wheeled out of the white
	house, and not a single photographer takes a picture...not
	yet.

	aides help roosevelt from the chair, and the press people all
	see the president struggle on legs that have no strength, to
	the podium.  his aides lock the steel clasps at the knees of
	his braces into place, and the president stands at the
	microphone.  and suddenly, from the front, roosevelt looks
	powerful, even majestic.

	now all the bulbs pop and flash.  he looks into the cameras.

			yesterday, december 7, 1941 -- a date
			which will live in infamy -- the united
			states of american was suddenly and
			deliberately attacked by naval and air
			forces of the empire of japan.

	over this, we see the bombing, the aftermath, the bodies
	being fished from the oil-soaked harbor.

			the distance of hawaii from japan makes
			it obvious that the attacks was planned
			many days or even weeks ago.  during the
			intervening time the japanese government
			has deliberately sought to deceive the
			united states by false statements and
			expressions of hope for continued peace.
