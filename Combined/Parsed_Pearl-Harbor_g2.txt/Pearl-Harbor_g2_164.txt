	ext.  skies above pearl harbor - day

	danny and rafe rejoin each other in the open sky; they've
	lost the zeros.  the p-40's are flying smoothly, side by
	side.  the two pilots look across at each other, going into
	battle together.  they speak through their radios.

					rafe
			you hear my okay?

					danny
			yeah.  so you can call me if you need
			help.

					rafe
			i got a half a tank.  you?

					danny
			little less.

	he fires a short burst to see if his guns work; they do.
	rafe does the same.  up ahead they see a formation of
	japanese planes, headed toward pearl.

					rafe
			they're in strafing formation, we'll blow
			right through their line.

	they look across at each other.

					rafe
			land of the free.

					danny
			home of the brave.

	side by side the p-40's scream in.
