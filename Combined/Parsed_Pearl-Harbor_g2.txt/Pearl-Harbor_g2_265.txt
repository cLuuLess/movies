	int.  danny's plane - day

	danny calls back to his gunner, who is watching the fuel
	supply.

					danny
			we got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind.  how
			we doing with fuel?

					gunner
			how do you think?

	the gunner is already pouring gas into the tanks from the
	extra cans.

	anthony stands and moves back to the rear of the plane, pulls
	a piece of chalk from his pocket and writes on the nose of
	the bombs -- "for america,"  "for pearl harbor,"  "for the
	arizona,"  "for billy."

	-- rafe flies, lost in thought...

	-- evelyn is back at pearl, struggling to keep her mind on
	   her work.

	-- danny is looking at his gauges, then at the picture in
	   his shirt.
