	ext.  bassingborne airfield - britain - day

	coming out of the blustery skies at the end of another deadly
	day, a squadron of spitfires chirps in for landings.  the
	planes are shot up and battered.

	rafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit is
	marked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories.  he
	taxis to a stop, and is met by ian, a scottish mechanic, who
	is dismayed at the state of the plane.

					ian
			leapin' jesus!

					rafe
				(climbing down)
			the struts are loose, the hydraulics are
			leaking, and the electrical system's
			shorting out in the cockpit.

					ian
			well which of those three ya want fixed?

					rafe
			all of 'em.

	rafe starts away, and ian calls to his back --

					ian
			if ye'd wanted a bloody cadillac ya
			should'a stayed in the bloody states!

					rafe
			and if you don't give me a plane that can
			handle combat, you better start learning
			to speak german.

					ian
			fook ya!

					rafe
			learn english, then!

					ian
			fook ya dooble!

	rafe moves to the barracks; ian keeps the fueling hose going,
	and moves to help the armorers reload the guns.
