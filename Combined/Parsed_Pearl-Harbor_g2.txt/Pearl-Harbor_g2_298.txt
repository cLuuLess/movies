	int.  rafe's plane - night

	rafe and red come to in the plane inverted and sinking.  they
	react, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane
	is quickly filling.  the navigator and gunner are
	unconscious; the bombardier is dead.  red struggles with the
	hatch and can't make it budge.

			it won't open til the plane fills!

	they struggle to breath as the water envelops them.  but as
	the water reaches the top, rafe takes a last breath and dives
	to the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the
	rest of the crew.
