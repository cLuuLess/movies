	roosevelt is at his desk when general marshall enters.

					general marshall
			we have bombed tokyo, mr. president.
			radio tokyo interrupted it's own
			broadcast to make the announcement.

					roosevelt
			have the planes made it to china?

					general marshall
			there've been some complications, sir.
			the chinese didn't receive our request
			for homing beacons until is was too late
			to get them set.  and the planes had to
			take off so early they may lack fuel to
			make the mainland anyway.

					roosevelt
			so those brave men are flying blind and
			running out of fuel.

					general marshall
			the chinese are sending out search
			parties to try to find the crews before
			the jap patrols do, if any of the planes
			make it.

					roosevelt
			god help them.
