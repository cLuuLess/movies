	int.  oahu bar - day

	danny and the pilots are in hawaiian shirts, their party in
	full swing.  a bucket-sized hollowed-out volcano sits in the
	middle of the table, with twelve straws emerging from the
	crater.  it's full of booze -- or was; danny and the other
	guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle as
	the last liquid is sucked dry.

					red
			more m-mai-tai's!

	coma is sitting there with them, beside red.

					coma
			absolutely right.

	everybody's having a ball, the new arrivals fitting right in
	with the others.  danny's a bit off to himself, lost in his
	own thoughts.  billy and anthony are doing the hula to the
	hawaiian music playing.

					coma
			no, you guys aren't doing it right.  it's
			in the hands.  they talk story.

	coma stands and starts demonstrating, explaining the gestures
	of his hula.

					coma
			fish swim in ocean... happy in the mother
			sea... girl, beautiful girl, with big
			jugs, walks into water...waves lapping at
			her thighs...

					anthony
			i never knew those dances were so
			sophisticated.

					coma
			...fish nibble at her breasts...

	coma's really into his dance, his hands over enormous
	imaginary breasts; but as he turns toward the windows --

					coma
			a more beautiful girl walks by...

	the guys see evelyn passing on the other side of the street,
	gorgeous in the sunshine.  coma's hands start squeezing the
	imaginary breasts of his hula.

					billy
			hey, isn't that evelyn?

	danny moves up to look.

					danny
			rafe's girl, evelyn?

					coma
			you guys know her?!  i gotta have an
			intro!  man, i'd like to --

	danny's hand is suddenly around coma's larynx.

					danny
			a friend of mine's in love with her.  so
			you don't even look -- not ever.

	danny releases him and coma staggers back to the table to
	nuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.

	danny looks out the window again and sees evelyn's beautiful
	form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base
	hospital.  danny moves back to the table, and as two burly
	hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto
	the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full
	of the potent liquid.  he shouts to the whole room --

					danny
			i'm a better pilot than any son-of-a-
			bitch on this island!  so i'm the one to
			say this!  here's to rafe mccawley!  a
			better pilot...and a better man...than
			me.

	the other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws.

					other pilots
			to rafe.

	danny drains the whole glass at one chug, and slams it down
	onto the table.  then he blinks, puts a hand on his stomach,
	and frowns.  coma recognizes the look.

					coma
			uh oh.  volcanic eruption!

	danny bends at the waist; his head obscured by the table.

					coma
			shit, he's puking on my feet!

					red
			well, you p-puked on his feet.

					coma
			yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
