	int.  japanese planners office - day

	the courier places the pictures onto the table in front of
	yamamoto, genda, and the other japanese officers.

					genda
			look at the ships -- all grouped.  perfect
			targets!

					japanese officer
			and the planes!  they are -- what is that
			american expression?  sitting geese?

					yamamoto
			sitting ducks.

					japanese officer
			how can they be so foolish?

					yamamoto
			they think no one would be stupid enough
			to attack them at pearl harbor.

					genda
			or perhaps they think no one is capable.
			look at this...

	he moves to a diagram displayed on the wall -- a simple
	display showing water depth and ship displacement.

					genda
			pearl harbor's depth of only forty feet
			makes them feel safe.  a torpedo dropped
			from an airplane plunges to one hundred
			feet before it can level off.  that is a
			conventional torpedo.  but we have been
			experimenting.

	from a stand beside his diagram he takes a set of wooden
	fins, attached to a circular metallic band.

					genda
			wooden fins.  we are testing them
			tomorrow.
