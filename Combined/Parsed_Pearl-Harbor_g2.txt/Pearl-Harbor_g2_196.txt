	ext.  hospital - day

	the nevada is grounded near the hospital; from the doorway
	evelyn can see the whole ship on fire, burning sailors
	leaping off the decks.  her hearing, her presence of mind,
	returns; she lets betty go, and grabs an orderly.

					evelyn
			go to the base hardware store and get
			some of those canister spray things they
			use for killing bugs.

					orderly
			insecticide?...

					evelyn
			no, just the sprayers.  we'll fill them
			with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them
			and cool the burns!  go!

	the orderly races away.  they can still hear the bombs
	falling outside.

	a sailor staggers toward the hospital from the nevada.  he is
	completely gray.  everyone stares at him, and then realizes
	he is nude, burned gray, his skin ash.

	evelyn rushes to help him, shouting back over her shoulder to
	the other nurses --

					evelyn
			we're gonna need every bed.  if they can
			breathe, make 'em get up and move
			someplace else!
