	int.  the carrier hornet - briefing room - day

	the pilots are gathered expectantly in the carrier's
	conference room.  doolittle strides in.

					doolittle
			gentlemen, i can now tell you that the
			target of this mission is tokyo.

	the pilots love it.  the ones who have not seen battle are
	grinning and vocal.  rafe, danny, anthony, and red are
	quieter, savoring the prospect of revenge.

					red
			and where's the secret base, sir?  the
			one we t-takeoff from.

					doolittle
			the navy will get us to within 400 miles
			of the japanese coast.  we'll launch off
			the carriers from there.

	suddenly the pilots don't like the sound of this.

					anthony
			sir, has this ever been done, launching
			an army bomber off a navy carrier?

					doolittle
			no.  any other questions?

					red
			c-colonel, we been p-practicing
			takeoff's, but i ain't sure we can land
			on these carriers d-decks.

					doolittle
			we won't have the fuel to get back to the
			carriers; they'll turn and run back to
			hawaii the minute we're airborne.

					red
			then wh-where do we land?

					doolittle
			i have a phrase i want you all to
			memorize:  "lushu hoo megwa fugi."  it
			means "i am an american."  in chinese.

	absolute silence among the pilots.
