	ext.  nurses' quarters - night

	danny escorts evelyn back to her quarters.

					danny
			don't worry.  i'll find him.

	he hugs her; their embrace earnest yet tingled with guilt,
	and danny leave quickly.  betty steps out of the nurses'
	quarters and hands evelyn a telegram.

					betty
			this came while you were gone.

	evelyn knows it's the telegram from rafe, to tell her he's
	alive.  without opening it, she begins to cry, and hurries
	away from the barracks so the other nurses won't see.
