	ext.  bassingborne airfield - britain - day

	a spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a
	string of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a
	shot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood
	still splattered over the inside of the cockpit.

					british air commander
			good lad.  didn't die till he'd landed
			and shut down his engine.  welcome to the
			war.

	he walks away, leaving rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.
