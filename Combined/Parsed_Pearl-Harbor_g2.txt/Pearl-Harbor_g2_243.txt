	int.  hotel room - night

	rafe enters his room and finds the light on...and evelyn's
	there waiting.

					rafe
			what?...

					evelyn
			they were bringing back a ship full of
			wounded and needed extra nurses along.  i
			wrote colonel doolittle, and told him i
			needed to see you before you go.

					rafe
			it must of been a convincing letter.

					evelyn
			it was.  i couldn't have you go away,
			wherever it is...to war...without knowing
			something.  you think i made a choice, of
			danny over you.  i didn't.  i didn't have
			a choice.  i'm pregnant.

	the blood drains from rafe's heart.  yet he finds the
	strength to move to her.  she turns away, so she won't throw
	her arms around him.

					rafe
			does danny know?

	she shakes her head, refuses to cry.

					evelyn
			i wasn't sure, until the day you turned
			up alive.  i never had a chance to tell
			him.  now i can't have him thinking about
			this when he needs to be thinking about
			his mission, and how to come back from
			it.

	she turns and faces him again.

					evelyn
			i want you thinking about that too.  just
			come back.
				(beat)
			rafe, i see it in your face.  you're
			thinking you don't have anything to live
			for.  don't you dare think that way.
			i'll never write a letter, or look at a
			sunset, without thinking of you.  i'll
			love you my whole life.  and i want you
			to live.

	she looks at him, her eyes bright with tears, but still she
	refuses to cry.  they both know they can't touch, or they'll
	never let go.  she walks past him, out of the room, closing
	the door softly behind her.
