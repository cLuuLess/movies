	int.  colonel doolittle's office - day

	colonel jimmy doolittle, mid-forties, is commander of the
	base.  he's as tough as he is good in the air.  and right now
	he's frowning at rafe mccawley, standing at attention before
	him.

					doolittle
			there are some people who think the
			outside loop is reckless and
			irresponsible.

					rafe
			how could it be irresponsible, sir, if
			you were the first man in the world to do
			it?

					doolittle
			don't get smart with me, son.

					rafe
			never, sir.  i just meant it's dangerous
			only for the kind of pilot who wants to
			show off, rather than inspire the other
			pilots in his unit.  and all you've done
			for me, sir, working out the transfer, i
			did it to say thanks.  to honor you, sir.
			what the french call a "homage."

					doolittle
			that's bullshit, son.  but it's really
			good bullshit.

					rafe
			thank you, sir.

	doolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes rafe's
	hand.

					doolittle
			good luck over there mccawley.  i admire
			your decision.

					rafe
			thank you, sir.
