	int.  hospital - pearl harbor - night

	rafe and danny enter.  it's a scene from hell.  doctors are
	doing amputations in the hallway.  the once-pristine hospital
	is now all red, with blood dripping through the mattresses,
	onto the floor...

	in the main ward, evelyn and the other nurses are using the
	fly sprayers to spritz cooling antiseptic on the charred
	bodies.  evelyn looks up and sees both rafe and danny.  her
	eyes register relief, but they are the only part of her that
	can show emotion now; the rest of her is covered in blood.
	rafe and danny move to her.
