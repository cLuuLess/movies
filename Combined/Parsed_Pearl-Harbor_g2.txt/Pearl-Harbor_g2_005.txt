	int.  the cockpits

	from rafe and danny's pov, the rush is awesome.

	the pilots on the ground watch in awe as the p-40's get so
	close they can't possibly get out of each other's way.
	billy, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown
	out the sound of the collision...

	at the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that
	their wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other
	belly to belly.

	in the cockpits

	rafe and danny burst out laughing.

	the pilots on the ground

	laugh and congratulate each other.

					training captain
			you know what they say... you can take the
			crop duster out of the country -- but
			don't put him in a p-40.

	rafe banks to land, and danny tucks in behind him.  danny has
	rafe's plane in his sights.

					danny
			if i had guns i'd be chewing up your --

	rafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind danny.

					rafe
			if you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.

	they're almost to the landing strip, rafe behind danny.  but
	as danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and
	snaps the nose of his plane straight up.

	the other pilots stop laughing.

					anthony
			he's doing an inside loop!

					training captain
			aw, shit...

	danny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come
	in behind rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.

					danny
			yee-hawww!!!

	danny taxis his plane over to join the others.  he's grinning
	as he slides back his cockpit cover; then --

					danny
			where's rafe?

	red, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the
	air.  seeing rafe's plane still in the air, danny starts to
	refasten his harness.

					training captain
			you're down, walker!  that's an order!

					danny
			what about him?

					training captain
			he's not taking my orders anymore.

	danny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he
	notices rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.

					danny
			he's gonna do it.

					billy
			do what?

					danny
			it.
				(beat)
			aw, shit.  aw shit shit shit...

	rafe's plane reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above
	them, and seems to pause in the air.

					danny
			i shouldn't'a done an inside loop.
			i shouldn't'a done an inside loop.

					billy
			why?

					danny
			cause now he's gonna do an outside loop.

					training captain
			aw shit.  aw shit shit shit...

	anthony and billy join in, like an involuntary chant --

					anthony & billy
			aw shit shit shit...

	rafe, in his cockpit, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  he
	noses the plane into a power dive.

	the p-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going
	so fast it begins to shudder.

	the other pilots are transfixed.  red is so nervous he can't
	get the words out.

					red
			aw sh- sh- sh- sh-

					billy
			shit.

					red
			yeah.

					danny
			you can do it, rafe.  you can do it.

	the p-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,
	snaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the
	runway.  rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the
	asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his
	head.

	he pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside
	of the circle.  the plane reaches the top of its arc, and
	almost stalls; but rafe noses it over again, toward the
	earth, only this time he has very little altitude.  the plane
	hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the
	curve...

	and makes it full circle.  rafe's head now is barely a foot
	off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.

	the other pilots burst into cheers.

	rafe, in his cockpit permits himself a smile.

	he lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for
	the training captain, who stands there shaking his head.

	danny jumps on the wing, as rafe stops and slides back his
	canopy.  danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.

					danny
			you could've killed yourself, you stupid
			bastard!

	he dives into the cockpit, hugging rafe.

					danny
			that was the most beautiful thing i ever
			saw.
