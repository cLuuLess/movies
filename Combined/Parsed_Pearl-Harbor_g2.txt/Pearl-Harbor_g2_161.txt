	ext.  haleiwa - auxiliary airfield - day

	haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic
	hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is
	a quonset hut.  a mechanic named earl, is out with the
	p-40's; and these are spread out, not bunched.

	earl and the p-40's

	the planes here have received loving care from earl -- which
	means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo
	belt, he yells.

					earl
			sum-bitch!

	the buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to
	a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.

					danny
			they ready, earl?

					earl
			they'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...

	what stops him is the cloud of zeros and dive bombers,
	shrieking in.

					danny
			cover!

	the guys scatter.  there are sandbags around the hut, and
	they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the
	first strafing pass, when a zero strafes one of the p-40's
	and a dive bomber blasts another.  earl stands up in shock
	and fury.

					earl
			you absolute mother-fuckin' son of a
			bitch!  you shot one of my planes!

	danny pulls him down, as the zeros roar overhead.

					danny
			this ain't a little feud, earl, it's
			world war two!

					rafe
			they're coming around for another pass.
			you got extra weapons and ammo?

					earl
			cock-suckin' right i do!!  in the gun
			lockers!

					danny
			you guys get those!  earl, rafe, come
			with me!

	danny, rafe and earl run to the planes that got hit and strip
	out the 20mm cannons and ammo.
