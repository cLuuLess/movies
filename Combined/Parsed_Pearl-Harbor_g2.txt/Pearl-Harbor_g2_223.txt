			the facts speak for themselves.  with
			confidence in our armed forces -- with
			the unbounding determination of our
			people -- we will gain the inevitable
			triumph -- so help us god.  i ask that
			the congress declare that since the
			unprovoked and dastardly attack by japan
			on sunday, december 7, 1941, a state of

	it rings through the radios of farm houses, to country boys
	gathered round; in the pool halls of big cities; in the fire
	houses and high schools...

	line up faster than the recruiters can handle them.
