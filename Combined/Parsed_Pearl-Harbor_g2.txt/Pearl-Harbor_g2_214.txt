	ext.  pearl harbor - aftermath - night

	dorie pilots the dinghy through the floating debris.  rafe
	and danny sit with him.  he stops over a dangerous pile of
	superstructure wreckage.

					dorie
			the arizona.  hold the dinghy steady, so
			it doesn't bust open.

	rafe and danny brace the dinghy so it doesn't move; but they
	still don't see what dorie is after as he fishes down in the
	water, for something barely at the surface; he works for a
	moment, then pulls it up.

	it's the oil-soaked flag of the arizona.
