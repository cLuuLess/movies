	ext.  skies - rafe and danny's plane - night

	danny's engines are sputtering; his gunner pours the last
	drops of gas into the tanks.

					danny
			flash rafe.  we're gonna bail.

	red sees anthony signal.

					red
			they've gotta jump.

					rafe
			not unless we know he's over land!

	rafe yells at danny, as if he could hear --

					rafe
			you are not bailing out into water!

					rafe's navigator
			coastline below!

	through a break in the clouds they spot a rocky shoreline.

					rafe
			we've got coast!  signal him to climb and
			jump.

	red signals; danny's plane signals back.

					red
			they don't have fuel to make altitude.
			he's gonna set it down in the water.

	rafe looks over at danny, who is gesturing; he gives up on
	the hand signals and grabs the flasher; red reads the morse
	code...

					red
			y-o-u... g-o.  you go on.

	rafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters.

					rafe
			n-o!  we stay together!  i'll go in
			first.

	rafe turns his bomber and danny follows, their planes arcing
	down toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking
	their view, as the altimeter winds down... at the last moment
	they see rocks looming out of the surf.
