	the men were sitting down to breakfast, but the machine gun
	bullets tearing up the outer walls have them clogging the
	doors, and it's so clogged they can't all get out.

	a steel bomb crashes through the roof and slams through the
	room, taking out tables and chairs before bouncing off the
	wall and coming to a stop.

	two soldiers, trapped within the mess hall, see it stop
	without detonating.  they are bug-eyed, hearts stopped.
