	ext.  the nevada - day

	the nevada, run aground at the shoreline, is now like a beast
	cut from the herd; the predators swarm after it with
	torpedoes and bombs.

	one torpedo, missing the nevada, skims right up the beach
	itself and blasts a house on the shore to fragments.

	bombs detonate along the nevada, engulfing the entire upper
	deck in flames, ravaging the sailors.
