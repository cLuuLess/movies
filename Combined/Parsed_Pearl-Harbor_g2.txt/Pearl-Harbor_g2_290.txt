	int.  hospital - pearl harbor - dusk

	the place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts.
	everyone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for
	each other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a
	spoon and feeds a badly burned buddy.  evelyn and her
	overworked nurses are looking after the critical cases.  but
	as she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops
	for just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays.
