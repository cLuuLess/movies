	the japanese low-altitude bombers, with zero escorts, zoom in
	over the field, blasting the clusters of american warplanes,
	whole squadrons taken out with one bomb.

	the mechanics and pilots, caught in the open, run from the
	strafing.  the zeros rake them down with machine gun fire.
	it's carnage.
