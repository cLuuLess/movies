	ext.  flight deck of the hornet - day

	the sailors who man the flight deck look at each other with
	bafflement as the worried pilots pace from one end of the
	deck to the other.  they're in a line like ducks, rafe in the
	lead and the others following, counting steps, each man
	measuring the distance.  shaking their heads, worrying.

	they stop at the end and look down at the sea far below them;
	it's dizzying.  anthony shoves red for fun before grabbing
	his shoulder to stop him from falling.

					red
			a-a-asshole!... maybe it's l-longer
			going this way.

	he starts pacing back the other way, as if the ship's longer
	in that direction.  the other pilots watch him for a moment,
	then follow him, counting again.

	rafe and danny are left standing alone at the end of the
	flight deck.  far over the surging sea.

			it's shorter than our practice runway.

					rafe
			they'll turn the ship into the wind
			before we launch.  that'll help.

					danny
			we'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of
			bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  i got
			another chinese phrase for doolittle.
			"mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  it
			means "who the fuck thought up this
			shit?"

	doolittle appears right beside them.

					doolittle
			he was a navy man.

	doolittle walks away.

					rafe
			maybe we'll be lucky with the weather.
