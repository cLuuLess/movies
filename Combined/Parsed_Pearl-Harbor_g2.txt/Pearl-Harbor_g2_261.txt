	ext.  hornet - flight deck - day

	the engines are revving.  the tachs are showing redline.  the
	crews are in their planes.  doolittle is first, just ahead of
	rafe and danny's b-25's.

	the battle pennants whip, the props blur, the wheels strain
	against the brakes; from the cockpits the flight deck looks
	impossibly short...and the american flag cracks in the wind.

	and now every pilot looks at doolittle's plane...

	doolittle starts the run down the flight deck...faster...the
	end looming.  he turns the plane almost vertical, standing it
	on its props...and lifts away smoothly.

	the sailors on deck cheer, like the japanese did before pearl
	harbor.

	rafe, danny, and the others take off too.
