	int.  hospital - pearl harbor - later

	evelyn clips the ends of her carefully applied stitches;
	dorie's eyes are rolled up as if he could watch from inside
	his skull.

					evelyn
			how often you fight like this?

					dorie
			every other sunday.  i'm heavyweight
			champion of the west virginia.

					evelyn
			what do you get for winning?

					dorie
			respect.

	she hands him a mirror.  he studies her work.

					dorie
			no doctor would'a give me that good.

	she walks him to the door.

					dorie
			thank you, 'mam.

					evelyn
			tell me something, dorie.  a man as big
			as you -- and smart too, you knew where
			to come when your ship couldn't help --
			do you still have to fight with your
			fists to get respect?

					dorie
			i left my mama and joined the navy to be
			a man.  they made me a cook -- and not
			even that, really -- i clean up after the
			other sailors eat.  i shine the officer's
			shoes.  in two years, they've never even
			let me fire a gun.

	now evelyn understands.

					evelyn
			you take care, dorie.

					dorie
			you too, 'mam.
