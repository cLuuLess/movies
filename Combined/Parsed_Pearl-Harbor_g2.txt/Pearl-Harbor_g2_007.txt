	int.  new jersey airfield - barracks - night

	the pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town.
	danny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on
	cologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.

	anthony and billy are combing their hair at the sinks.  billy
	declares to his image in the mirror --

					billy
			you good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you
			ever die!

					anthony
			that's your line for tonight, ya know.

					billy
			what, good-lookin' sumbitch?

					anthony
			no, numbnuts, die.  you get your nurse
			alone, you look her in the eye, and say,
			"baby, they're training me for war, and i
			don't know what'll happen.  but if i die
			tomorrow, i wanna know that we lived all
			we could tonight."  i've never known it
			to fail.

	red finishes brushing his teeth at the sink beside them.

					red
			he's n-never known it to work, either.

	the guys head out laughing, running into rafe coming in.

					danny
			doolittle didn't kill you?  attaboy!

	rafe catches danny's arm.

					rafe
			danny, there's something i gotta tell
			you...
