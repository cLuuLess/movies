	ext.  pearl harbor - aftermath - day

	divers are going down, trying to save the trapped men.  but
	the tangle of the arizona is horrific.  one diver gets
	trapped, and another tries to extricate him, and the steel
	shifts and falls on them both.

	on the deck of bomb-shattered battleship, a naval captain
	oversees rescue efforts.  the 17-year-old sailor he sent off
	for ammo now approaches him, with great concern.

					seventeen-year-old sailor
			sir, i...i lost the dinghy.

	the captain looks out over the wreckage, great battleships
	devastated in every direction.

					captain
			well, son, we won't worry about the
			dinghy today.
