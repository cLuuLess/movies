	int.  barber shop - day

	admiral kimmel is settling into the barber chair when his
	aide enters and nods for the barber to move a few paces away,
	so that he can speak privately.

					aide
			sir, we just had an intelligence
			intercept.  someone from tokyo called a
			local dentist whose office looks over
			pearl.  they wanted to know the exact
			location of the ships.

					admiral kimmel
			someone from tokyo asks a dentist how the
			ships are sitting... what are we supposed
			to do about that?

					aide
			i...don't know, sir.  but it just seemed
			significant.

					admiral kimmel
			have intelligence keep monitoring him.

	the admiral sinks back into the chair.
