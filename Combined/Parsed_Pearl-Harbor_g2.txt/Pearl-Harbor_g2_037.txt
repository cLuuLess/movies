	ext.  pearl harbor - air base - barracks - day

	danny walker and his pilot buddies have just arrived; they
	enter the barracks, talking happily.

					red
			if i ain't n-never on a b-boat again,
			it'll be too s-soon.

					billy
			where are the women on this --

	danny has stopped before the others; now all of them see that
	the other pilots who inhabit this air base are still in their
	beds, sleeping off hangovers.  they wear hawaiian shirts;
	they haven't shaved.

					red
			they're s-still asleep!

	danny pauses for a moment, then shouts --

					danny
			drop your cocks and grab your socks,
			boys!  the terror of the skies are here!

	the sleeping pilots groan, and cover their heads with their
	pillows.

					anthony
			they're all drunk.

	one guy sits up in bed, his hair pointing every direction of
	the compass, his tongue working as if to wipe a terrible
	taste from his mouth.  as his feet dangle over the side of
	the bunk and one of them touches the floor, a sensation
	reaches his sotted brain; he raises that foot to look at its
	bottom, and finds a new tattoo, on the sole of his foot; he
	blinks as if trying to remember how it got there.

	danny moves over to him, and dubs him with a name, coma.

					danny
			hey.  you.  mr. coma.

					coma
			where's that lizard?

					danny
			what lizard?

					coma
			the one that slept in my mouth last
			night.

					danny
			what the hell happened to you guys?

	coma is one of those drunks who speak as if he's always about
	to burp.

					coma
			ever hear of mai-tai's?  comes in a
			big...pot.  like...like...

					red
			a m-missionary?

					coma
			no, like...

	coma emits a pukey, toxic burp that has danny and his buddies
	wincing back from the fumes.

					danny
			this is an air base?  where's your squad
			commander?

	the question soaks through to coma's brain.  his right hand
	points...and his left hand points...in different directions.
	his hands float around in the air until finally both of them
	are indicating the same direction, behind his back.  in the
	bunk beyond coma's is another drunk pilot in a hawaiian
	shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that
	protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him
	too.

	danny and his buddies are speechless -- except for red
	strange.

					red
			i th-think i'm gonna like it here.

					coma
			you guys are new?

					danny
			yeah.

					coma
			mai-tai's.  i got this to tell ya, about
			mai-tai's.

	coma's head drifts forward slowly; they think for a moment
	he's looking for something under the bed.  then he pukes.
	danny leaps back from the splatter, and marches out of the
	barracks; his friends follow.
