	int.  general short's office - day

	short and his staff are assessing damage.

					short
			i want lookouts and sentries everywhere,
			with orders to shoot first and ask
			questions later.

					colonel
			you think an invasion possible, general?

					short
			after this morning, we better not
			consider anything impossible.

	an aide hands short the telegram.  he reads it --

					short
			from washington.  "intelligence reports
			an ultimatum from japan to be given
			precisely at one p.m.  washington time.
			just what significance the hour set may
			have we do not know, but be on alert
			accordingly."

	the irony is bitter in his throat.
