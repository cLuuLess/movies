	ext.  on the american ships - day

	fire and smoke are turning everything into chaos.  some
	sailors rush to man the guns, they find the ammo boxes
	locked.

	under the bombing and strafing, they find a wrench and start
	pounding on the lock, trying to break open the ammo box.
	then they break open the lock -- and find the ammo box empty.

					sailor

	he runs for the ladders, and is shot down before he gets
	there.
