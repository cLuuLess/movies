	ext.  military base hospital - night

	the pov of someone moving through the gathering darkness
	approaches the hospital.

	the lights from within the hospital, and the pristine white
	beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow,
	where evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina in a
	giant's jewel box.

	now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and can
	tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't tell
	who.  he's standing dead still, transfixed in watching evelyn
	through the windows.
