	they are gasping, running out of air.

			you hear something?

	something stirs in the ship; a noise...from where?  then a
	point of light; sparks fly into the room; somebody's cutting
	through the wall.  and the sparks illuminate faces suddenly
	filled with hope.

	but as the cut enlarges, the trapped air, compressed by the
	water, starts rushing out -- and the water starts rising
	again.  the trapped sailors hope turns to terror.

			it's letting out air, and letting in
			water!

	the steel circle pops out, and they knock the welders down in
	their hurry to escape.

	some of the sailors who were trapped are naked.  they fight
	their way toward the escape hole cut into the hull, assisted
	by rescue workers.
