	medics have already started bringing in the wounded.  evelyn
	is like a frantic traffic cop.

			evelyn!  where's the morphine?

	the front ward

	evelyn runs in, snaps open the cabinet, grabs a bag of
	morphine sticks, and is about to run out again when she sees
	the arizona go up.

	for a moment she's frozen, then she actually sees the shock
	wave traveling across the bay and through the trees like an
	invisible wall.  she's trying to cross her arms over her
	face, and dive to the floor, just as the windows blow out
	from the concussion, and glass flies over everything.
