	the news of the raid hits washington...and the rest of
	america.  if it isn't wild celebration; when people see the
	headline:  air raid on tokyo, and doolittle does much; their
	faces change, as if finally told what they already knew --
	that america would prevail.

					voice over
			the doolittle raid was the pivotal moment
			of america's war with japan.  before it,
			america knew nothing but defeat; after
			it, nothing but victory.
				(beat)
			one crew of doolittle's raiders made it to
			vladivostok, russia, where they were
			interred for much of the war.  thirteen
			planes crash landed in china, where the
			chinese people helped the americans
			escape, and had their villages destroyed
			and citizens executed by the japanese
			forces of occupation.  two crews were
			captured by the japanese and three fliers
			were executed without trial, called "war
			criminals" by the japanese.  jimmy
			doolittle was promoted to general, and
			given the medal of honor.

	we see the ceremony at the white house, as roosevelt presents
	doolittle with the metal.
