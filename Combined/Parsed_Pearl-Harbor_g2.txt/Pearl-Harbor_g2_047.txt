	ext.  nurses' quarters - oahu - night

	creeping through the vegetation, red leads anthony and billy
	to a spot outside the nurses' barracks; they can see the
	girls through the barracks window.

			red, peeping tom stuff can get us court-
			marshaled.

					red
			shhh!

	anthony and billy are baffled, even more so when red strides
	into the open, right outside the nurses' window.

	and then, red begins to sing.

					red
				(singing)
			oh...betty, betty, betty, you're the one
			for me, betty, betty, betty, betty, can't
			you see...

	anthony and billy look at each other, dumbfounded.  the
	nurses move to the open windows.  red's singing is pretty
	good -- though not that good.  but he doesn't stutter when he
	sings.

					red
				(singing)
			i'll be yours for eternity, betty, betty,
			betty, betty, betty!

	anthony and billy are hysterical, trying to keep their
	laughter hidden.  but then they see the effect this is having
	on the women -- especially on betty.  she's smitten.

	red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he
	finishes, betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses
	applaud.  they move off into the darkness, arm and arm.

	the nurses go back to their primping.

	anthony and billy are changed men.  anthony stands up;
	billy's baffled.  anthony moves out and starts singing.

					anthony
				(singing)
			oh sandra...i like you...love you...

	he's terrible.  the nurses pelt him with hairbrushes,
	curlers, shoes...
