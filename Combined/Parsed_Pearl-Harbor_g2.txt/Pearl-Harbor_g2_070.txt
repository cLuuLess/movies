	int.  surveillance base - day

	some tired army intelligence types -- a listener, a tracker,
	and an intelligence supervisor, are sitting at a bank of
	phones.  the listener is a japanese-american.

					listener
			here's something, over the line from
			tokyo.

	he switches on the recording equipment and looks to the
	tracer, sitting at a battery of equipment.

					tracer
			it's connected to a local dentist.  his
			office is beside pearl harbor.

					intelligence supervisor
			this dentist, is he a spy?

					listener
			sounds too innocent.  his accent is from
			the old country.  somebody official-
			sounding calls, he thinks it's
			discourteous not to respond.
