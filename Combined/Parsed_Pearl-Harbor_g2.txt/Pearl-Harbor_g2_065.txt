	ext.  pacific ocean - day

	a huge japanese fleet steams toward hawaii.  it is an awesome
	sight.  carriers, battleships, destroyers, and entire battle
	group, traveling under complete radio silence, their hulls
	power through the waves.  on the lower decks of the carriers
	are hundreds of planes -- fighters and bombers.
