	ext.  pearl harbor - day

	the harbor is already a mass of destruction and panic;
	screaming everywhere, men trying to fight fires, move the
	wounded; the second wave of planes hits, and tremendous
	explosions now rock the secondary ships like the destroyer
	shaw, blasting it apart.

	but the japanese pilots are now having trouble with the thick
	black smoke coming out of the damaged ships, and off the oil
	fires along the water.  one torpedo plane, its pilot flying
	blind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to
	a crash.

	still, even in the chaos on the ships, the sailors struggle
	to survive, inventively.  men trapped on one burning ship use
	the severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to
	cross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them.

	others jump into the water and swim through the burning oil,
	towing buddies too wounded to swim themselves.
