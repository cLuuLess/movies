	ext.  china coast - night

	rafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the
	engine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface;
	then the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a
	wall, flipping over it's nose.

	danny's plane is struggling; when he tries to add throttle,
	the engines sputter out.  the plane drops, skips once on the
	surface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first.

	danny and anthony are ejected through the top of the
	fuselage; coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose
	of the plane.
