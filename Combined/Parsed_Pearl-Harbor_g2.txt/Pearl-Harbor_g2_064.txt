			the attack seems inevitable.  the
			question is where?  the way to answer
			that question is to ask:  if we were the
			japanese, how would we do it?

			between america and the far east are the
			sea lanes where the winds and the
			currents make the best route for
			shipping.  far above is the northern
			route, between canada and russia.
			between these two is something they call
			the vacant sea.  if i were the japs, i'd
			send a task force there.  you could hide
			the entire land mass of asia in the
			vacant sea, and nobody would know.

					admiral
			so they pop out and attack where?

					vice admiral
			that's the problem, admiral.  they could
			hit anywhere they want.

	nobody has any solution.
