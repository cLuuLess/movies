	int.  hospital - traction ward - day

	four men from a jeep accident are lying in traction, their
	casted limbs roped in the air.  evelyn runs in, grabbing a
	razor blade from the medical cabinet -- and telling barbara
	and sandra.

					evelyn
			cut them down, and take cover!!  hurry!

	bombs are falling outside, on the airfield this wing of the
	hospital faces.  evelyn slices the traction ropes of a man
	with both legs broken; ignoring his groans, she rolls him out
	of the bed and covers him with the mattress.  the other
	nurses follow her lead.  the bombs are coming toward the
	hospital ward; evelyn finishes with the fourth man and covers
	him and herself with the mattress, just as a bomb craters
	outside the window.

	the nurses and patients look up after the explosions have
	passed; there's a chunk of smoking shrapnel lying on the
	springs of the bunk where the last man had been lying.
