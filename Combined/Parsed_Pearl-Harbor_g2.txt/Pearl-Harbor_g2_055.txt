	ext.  battleship west virginia - pearl harbor - day

	the sailors have assembled on deck for the ship's heavyweight
	championship fight, a contest made more interesting to the
	sailors because one of the combatants is white and the other
	is black.

	the battle is more toughness than technique.  the guys
	throwing haymakers and shoving each other around the roped
	area, as their shipmates cheer and make wild bets.  the white
	guy digs a punch deep into the black guy's ribs, and the
	black guy slams a double left hook into the white guy's
	belly, making him back up and say --

					white boxer
			you hit hard -- for a cook.

	the black guy rushes the white guy, only to catch a right
	cross that wobbles his knees and makes him stagger, with a
	fresh cut over his right eye.  the white guy now rushes in,
	and the black guy (his name is dorie miller) throws an upper
	cut that drops his opponent like a sack of rocks.

	the sailors cheer wildly.  dorie steps back, and rubs his
	glove across his brow.  it's really bleeding now.
