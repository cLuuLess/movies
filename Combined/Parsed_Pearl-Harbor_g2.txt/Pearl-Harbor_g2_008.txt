	ext.  new jersey barracks - night

	rafe and danny are walking on the parade ground; the other
	guys are already on the bus that will take them into town.
	danny's upset by what rafe just told him.

					danny
			how could you do this?

					rafe
			the colonel helped me work it out.

					danny
			i don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,
			i mean how the hell did you do it without
			letting me in on it?

					rafe
			i'm sorry, danny, but they're only
			accepting the best pilots.

					danny
			don't make this a joke, rafe.  you're
			talking about war, and i know what war
			does to people.

					rafe
			danny, you know how many times i saw you
			come to school with a black eye or a
			busted nose, and couldn't do a thing
			about it -- for you, or for your mother...
			or your father, with his lungs scorched
			out with mustard gas, and more left of
			his lungs than there was of his spirit?
			you've made your sacrifice, danny.  it's
			time i made mine.

				(from the bus)
			the nurses are waiting!

					rafe
			let's go.

					danny
			nah, you go on.

					rafe
			i have to talk to evelyn.  and i want you
			to meet her.

					danny
			some other time.  i don't feel like a
			party.

	danny walks away.  the bus driver's ready to leave, and red
	is honking the horn for rafe to come.  rafe reluctantly lets
	danny go, and heads for the bus, where the pilots are
	chanting --

					pilots voice
			nurses!  nurses!  nurses!
