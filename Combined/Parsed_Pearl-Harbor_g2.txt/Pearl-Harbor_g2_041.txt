	ext.  the skies above oahu - day

	a seaplane takes tourists on an excursion above pearl harbor
	and around the island of oahu.  one japanese tourist shoots
	pictures rapidly...first of the ships as seen from overhead;
	then he leans to the other side of the plane and shoots
	pictures of the airfield below them.
