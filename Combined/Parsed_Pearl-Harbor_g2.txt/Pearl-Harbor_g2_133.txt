	ext.  the attack on pearl harbor - day

	-- the first wave of planes drop more torpedoes; they plunge
	   beneath the surface, their wooden fins working perfectly,
	   the torpedoes speeding to their targets...

	we see their awesome blasts against the anchored ships as the
	torpedoes hit home.

	-- the japanese low altitude bombers come in; some drop their
	   bombs directly into the ships; some skip their bombs
	   across the water, the bombs glancing off the surface and
	   then slamming the sides of battleships with tremendous
	   explosions.

	-- inside the ships, sleeping sailors are thrown from their
	   bunks; those already awakened run for their battle
	   stations, and try to make it up to the deck; but there's
	   no escape there, as...

	-- zero fighter planes strafe the ships, raking the decks and
	   killing sailors with machine gun fire.
