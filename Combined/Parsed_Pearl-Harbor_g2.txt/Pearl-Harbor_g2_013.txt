	ext.  the night club - night

	they find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the
	river, and manhattan beyond.  evelyn takes in the view,
	breathes in the air; she still holds the rose.

			whatever you're trying to tell me isn't
			good, is it.  or it wouldn't be so hard
			to say.

					rafe
			the only reason it's hard to say is that
			i keep thinking i don't have the right to
			say it.  but i've got to because it's
			true.  i love you.
				(beat)
			that must surprise you.

					evelyn
			it surprises me that i'm not the only one
			on this balcony who feels that way.

	the power of hearing this from each other grips them both.

					rafe
			there's one thing i have to say.  i'm
			going away.

					evelyn
			we're all going away.

					rafe
			i'm going to the war.  the real war.
			hitler's taken europe.  the brits are
			hanging on by their fingernails, and if
			they lose, there'll be more people killed
			than anybody can imagine.  and not just
			there, but here.

					evelyn
			but you're in the u.s. army, how could
			you --

					rafe
			colonel doolittle pulled the strings, and
			put me on loan to the r.a.f.  they need
			pilots, and we need experience.  i leave
			tomorrow.

					evelyn
			you waited til tonight to tell me?

					rafe
			i had to tell you in person.  because
			there's something else i need to say.

	he studies her face, burning it into his memory.

					rafe
			evelyn...you know the line -- let's make
			tonight memorable.  what i feel about you
			makes it impossible for me to say
			something like that.  if i don't come
			back, i don't want to saddle you with
			regret and sadness you'll carry the rest
			of your life.

					evelyn
			i don't know if you can choose that,
			rafe.

					rafe
			maybe not.  but i need you to know.  i
			love you.  and i will come back.  i'll
			find a way.  and then we'll get a chance
			to know if what i felt the first moment i
			saw you, and every minute since then, is
			real.

					evelyn
			do one thing for me, before you go.

	she takes his hand and leads him inside.
