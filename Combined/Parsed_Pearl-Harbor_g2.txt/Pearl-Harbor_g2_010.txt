	ext.  new york train station - night

	our pilots -- indeed leather-jacketed and handsome -- are
	waiting on the platform.  among then is rafe, holding
	something behind his back, as the train pulls in and shudders
	to a stop, clouds of steam jetting onto the platform and
	giving the moment a dream-like haze.
