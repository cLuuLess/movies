	ext.  eglin field - night

	danny's outside, looking up at the moon.  rafe appears and
	moves up beside him.

					danny
			fun today.  like old times.

					rafe
			danny, what the hell are you trying to do
			out there?

					danny
			what do you mean?  i'm just doing what
			we've always done.

					rafe
			no.  you're trying to beat me.

					danny
			we've always tried to beat each other.

					rafe
			bullshit.  we've played with each other,
			pushed each other.  this is different.
			like you want to prove that you're
			better than me.  who's that for --
			evelyn?

	danny's anger flares for a moment -- but rafe's hit home.

					danny
			maybe just trying to measure up.

					rafe
			what's between you and her is between you
			and her.  but here's what's between you
			and me.  everybody has a hero, danny.
			and you're mine.

	danny's caught off-guard.

					rafe
			when we were growing up, i had
			everything.  you had nothing.  you
			climbed out of a hole i couldn't even see
			the bottom of.  i think maybe when i went
			off to england, i was trying to measure
			up to you.  measuring up's over.  let's
			just look out for each other.  okay?

	they embrace, closer now than ever.

	montage - intercut

	with the planes practicing their short takeoffs, we see
	roosevelt in one of his fireside chats, his voice broadcast
	across america...

					roosevelt's voice
			good evening, america...

	families all across america are gathered around radios,
	listening.

					roosevelt's voice
			i'm told that 80% of american families
			are listening to these fireside chats of
			ours, and i'm happy we can come together,
			as one great american family.  i'd like
			each of you within the sound of my voice
			to find a map...

	the families do, gathering around encyclopedias, school
	books, any reference they have, spread on kitchen tables,
	suburban living room rugs, or farmhouse hearths...

	and the b-25's, all sixteen of them, begin a journey in
	formation, flying at treetop level across america:
	mississippi delta land, texas plains, arizona mesas...

					roosevelt's voice
			look at the pacific ocean.  it covers
			half the surface of the earth.  and look
			at the great atlantic.  the oceans both
			divide and connect us to our enemies, and
			either they will come to us, or we will
			go to them...

	the formation of b-25's reaches san francisco.
