	the two p-40's drop out of the sky and bounce to a landing;
	anthony and red have been pushing the wreckage off the field
	with the buick.  danny and rafe pull the p-40's behind the
	burning quonset hut, and it's like a pit stop at a race
	track; earl rushes up and starts fueling the planes, their
	engines still running.

					danny
			we need ammo too!

	earl shouts instructions to the pilots.

					earl
			strip it from the wrecks!

	the other pilots race to the wrecked p-40's and start pulling
	out ammo belts.  earl glares at the smoking engine of danny's
	plane, and the bullet holes.

					earl
			who the fuck taught you to fly?

					danny
			he did.

	earl looks at rafe's plane, more shot-up and abused than
	danny's.  rafe grins and waves to him.  earl mumbles a stream
	of guttural and unintelligible obscenities.

	the zeros that followed them sweep down, strafing.  one
	mechanic, running across the field with a belt of ammo, goes
	down.  coma, running behind him, picks up the fallen man's
	ammo and his own, bringing both to the planes behind the hut.
	he, red, and anthony reload the machine guns in rafe and
	danny's planes.

	rafe and danny gun their engines and head back into the air,
	the grounded pilots firing a covering barrage and earl even
	coming up with a 12-gauge shotgun to fire at the zeros as
	they rush past.
