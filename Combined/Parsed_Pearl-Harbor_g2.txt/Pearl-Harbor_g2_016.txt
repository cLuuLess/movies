	ext.  train station - dawn

	rafe and danny stand on the platform.  rafe's got his gear
	packed in a bag slung over his shoulder.

					conductor's voice
			all aboard!

	rafe glances once more toward the revolving doors from the
	station that lead onto the platform.

					danny
			didn't you say you told her not to come?

					rafe
			yeah.

					danny
			then why are you looking for her?

					rafe
			it's a test.  if i asked her to come and
			she came, it wouldn't tell me anything.
			if i tell her not to come, and she
			comes...then i know she loves me.

					voice
			all aboard!

					danny
			you're still a kid, ya know that?  take
			care of yourself.

					rafe
			you too.

	rafe sticks his hand out to danny.  danny knocks it away, and
	hugs him.

	rafe steps onto the train, and it pulls away.  rafe waves.
	danny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...

					danny
			give 'em hell, rafe.
