	ext.  pearl harbor - military base - day

	evelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps.
	as they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially
	evelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --

					guard
			i've died and gone to heaven.

	the guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses.  the jeeps
	drive through.  the nurses are loving this island paradise
	already.

			you know the ratio of men to women on
			this island?  four-thousand...to one.

	barbara slides on a new pair of sunglasses with plastic palm
	trees glued on the sides, and calls back to the guards as the
	jeeps pull away --

					barbara
			see ya on the beach, boys!
