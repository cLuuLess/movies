	int.  below decks of the west virginia - day

	dorie miller, the boxing champion/kitchen helper, is working
	picking up the breakfast trays when he feels the ship
	shudder.  the intercom comes alive --

					intercom
			battle stations!  battle stations!  this
			is not a drill!

	men run to the ladders, and the shaking of the ship from a
	bomb blast tosses them off; dorie's at the foot of the ladder
	when men fall back on top of him.
