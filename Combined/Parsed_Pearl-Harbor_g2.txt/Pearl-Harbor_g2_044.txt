	ext.  japanese island - day

	yamamoto and his planners have flown to a quiet japanese
	island, sunlit and pleasant.  they are gathered on the shore
	of the island's natural harbor.  wooden targets -- basically
	huge plank barriers -- are sunk into the water like ships at
	anchor.  a squadron of japanese planes zooms overhead, taking
	up attack positions.

					genda
			we have chosen this place because its
			depth is exactly the same as pearl
			harbor's.

	genda speaks into a field radio.  a lone plane drops out of
	formation and goes into a low-level approach, speeding up and
	dropping its torpedo.

	below the surface we see the torpedo as it plunges at two
	hundred miles an hour into the sunlit sea.  with the wooden
	fins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the
	sea floor.

	above the surface the planners see the path of the torpedo;
	it hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying thunk.  the
	planners are impressed -- but yamamoto is not satisfied.

					yamamoto
			uncharged torpedoes have different
			balance.

					genda
			i have arranged a live fire drill -- with
			your permission.

	yamamoto nods; genda speaks again into his radio, and another
	plane swoops down and drops a torpedo.  genda holds his hands
	to his ears, causing the others to do the same; even though
	they wonder at the need.

	the torpedo hits the barrier, and the explosion is deafening,
	and of shocking force; the entire barrier is blown to
	toothpicks.

					genda
			of course against a ship the explosion
			will not be dissipated, and will have
			more force.

	the planners, nearly blown off their feet, nod as if they
	knew that all the time.
