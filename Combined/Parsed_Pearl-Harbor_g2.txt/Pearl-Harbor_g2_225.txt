	ext.  pearl harbor - hickam base - day

	there is a mass memorial service going on, with caskets
	draped in flags.

	there are also coffins covered in japanese flags, their
	drowned fliers being treated now with respect.

	everyone is in their best uniforms.  the pilots -- rafe,
	danny, and the other guys -- are looking at billy's coffin;
	evelyn, next to danny, on his appropriate side is looking at
	one that belongs to betty.  so is red; he's grieving.

					minister
			...where is god in this?  our enemies
			believe a divine wind protects them.  we
			see our friends laid out before us, and
			find it hard to believe in anything at
			all.

	rafe and evelyn exchange a glance, past danny.

					minister
			though we cannot understand why our
			friends should die while we live, we can
			affirm our truest selves in our belief
			that any god worth divinity would choose
			both justice and mercy, and would take
			these fallen brothers and sisters into
			eternal peace.  amen.

	as the mourners disperse, evelyn puts a lei on betty's
	casket; red does the same, then breaks down beside danny.  as
	danny comforts him, evelyn moves to rafe.

					evelyn
			rafe --

					rafe
			i need to tell you something.  i didn't
			know what it was to lose somebody, to see
			death and find how much it scares you.
			that you haven't lived and loved enough.
			i didn't understand.  forgive me.

					evelyn
			rafe... no.  you forgive me.

					rafe
			of course i forgive you.  i know what you
			feel for danny is real.  and your choice
			is your choice.

					evelyn
			that's what i have to tell you, rafe.  it
			wasn't a choice.  it --

	an army corps major steps up and interrupts.

					major
			lieutenant rafe mccawley?

					rafe
			yes, major.

					major
			lieutenant daniel walker here too?

	danny sees him and moves up.

					danny
			i'm walker.

					major
			you're going stateside.  we fly out in
			half an hour.

	he hands them both orders.

					rafe
			what for, sir?

					major
			ask colonel doolittle.  those orders are
			from him.
