	roosevelt meets with his advisors.

			gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the
			fact that our enemies believe they can
			defeat us -- it's the fact that our people
			believe it too.  i want a plan -- a
			workable plan -- to hit the heart of
			japan, to bomb them the way they have
			bombed us.

					admiral
			mr. president, pearl harbor caught us
			because we didn't face facts.  this isn't
			a time for ignoring them again.  there
			are no planes in the entire american
			arsenal capable of covering the distance
			to japan from any land base we control
			while carrying enough bombs to do any
			damage whatsoever.

					general marshall
			he's right, mr. president.  the army has
			long range bombers, but no place to
			launch them from.  midway's too far,
			china is overrun by japanese forces, and
			russia refuses to go to war with japan
			and won't allow us to launch a raid from
			there.

					admiral
			the navy's planes are small, carry light
			loads, and have short range.  we would
			have to get them within a few hundred
			miles of japan, and therefore risk our
			carriers.  and if we lose our carriers,
			we have no shield against invasion.

					roosevelt
			what if the japanese did invade?

					general marshall
			we've done studies.  we're confident we
			would turn them back eventually...after
			they'd gotten as far as chicago.

					admiral
			mr. president...with all respect...what
			you are asking can't be done.

	roosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and
	struggles to lift himself.  aides jump to help him, but he
	waves them off.  with inhuman physical effort, that has his
	neck veins bulging and sweat popping on his face, roosevelt
	stands on his withered legs.

					roosevelt
			do not tell me...it can't be done.
