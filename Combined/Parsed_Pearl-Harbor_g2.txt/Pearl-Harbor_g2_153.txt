	the pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed.  seeing
	what's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the
	clustered american planes are blowing up in groups, and the
	pilots are knocked to the ground.

			goddamn japs!

	billy jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of
	fighters that hasn't gone up yet.

					anthony
			billy!

	anthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he
	misses; billy gets a few steps before the fire from a
	strafing zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror
	as billy gets shorter as he runs; the zero's machine gun fire
	is sawing his legs off from the feet up.

	billy falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls
	almost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.

	their innocence, like america's, is gone in that moment.
