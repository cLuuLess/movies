	int.  presidential bedroom - night

	roosevelt's valet leans over him.

	roosevelt wakes; beside the valet is a presidential aide.

					aide
			mr. president, we've received a message
			from the argentinian ambassador to japan.
			his sources tell him the japanese are
			assembling their fleet to attack us.

					president roosevelt
			we're picking up warnings for every
			american base in the pacific.  does this
			ambassador know the target?

					aide
			not for sure.  but he thinks it's pearl
			harbor.

					president roosevelt
			tell the pentagon.

	the aide leaves quickly and roosevelt starts to get out of
	bed; his valet comes to help him.

					president roosevelt
			no, george, i need the practice, in case
			there's a fire.

	roosevelt drags himself out of bed, crawling toward the
	bathroom, his powerful arms dragging his lifeless legs.
