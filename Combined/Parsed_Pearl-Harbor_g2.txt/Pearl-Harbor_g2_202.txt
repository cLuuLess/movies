	ext.  pearl harbor - aftermath - day

	the harbor is a place of shattered bodies and shattered
	ships.  blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of it
	made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the
	choking black smoke those fires produce.

	every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher
	bearer, medic, iron worker.  they fish men from the water,
	extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships.
	everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help,
	the helpers for more help.

	local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the water
	mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base
	swimming pool toward the burning ships.

	the photographer records this with his black-and-white film
	camera.  he is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitude
	of what he is recording -- the loss of america's innocence.
