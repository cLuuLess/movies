	ext.  pearl harbor - day

	the sailors in the boat get strafed, the rounds cutting
	between them and blasting their boat in two.  they jump into
	the oily water and swim toward shore.

	other sailors are in the water with them, struggling,
	swallowing the vile black liquid as they battle to swim.
	errant bombs and shrapnel hit beside them, killing some;
	other lose strength and slide beneath the surface.

	the sailors from the ammo boat make it ashore; it's hot there
	too, with bullets and bombs all around.  one sailor has to
	stop and puke from the oil; his buddy grabs him and they run
	for cover; they find it in the dugout of the baseball
	diamond.
