	ext.  military base hospital - night

	rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down.

	angle - evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench,
	his form hauntingly familiar.  he hears her, and looks up.
	it's rafe.

	from evelyn's pov, the whole world spins.  she faints.

	rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground.  he
	gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face.
	he's real, very real.

					rafe
			evelyn.

	she's trembling, shaking.  he lifts her to her feet, and
	moves her to the bench.

					rafe
			i sent telegrams, i guess the military
			traffic held them up.

					evelyn
			why were you sitting here, instead of...

					rafe
			i saw you, i couldn't go in, i...just
			stood there wondering if you knew.  you
			looked...sad, and i had to sit down a
			minute.

					evelyn
			how did you?...

					rafe
			...survive?  i jumped in a patch of fog,
			and nobody could see me.  i hit the water
			hard.  and it was so...cold.

	he looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades
	to black.  there's something he thinks about saying, and
	doesn't.  then...

					rafe
			i don't know how long i was in the water.
			a norwegian freighter picked me up.  they
			were headed to spain.  they docked in la
			rota, right beside a german ship, and
			told me to stay hidden below.  i was
			afraid they'd turn me in, so i stole some
			clothes, jumped ship, and found a church,
			where the priest contacted the
			resistance, and got me on a freighter to
			new york.

	he looks at her, then looks down again.

					rafe
			i called my folks, then colonel
			doolittle.  the colonel sent a man to
			pick me up.  they wanted to debrief me.
			i told the colonel i needed to see
			somebody first, and he had a supply
			flight heading out in an hour.
				(beat)
			i've done a lot of talking.  you haven't
			said anything.

					evelyn
			i'm just...so amazed, so glad to know
			that you're okay.  you are okay, aren't
			you?

					rafe
			nothing that won't heal.  i guess.

	at these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment.

					evelyn
			it's been...so different, being so sure
			you were dead.

					rafe
			i'm so sorry for what you must've gone
			through, but i'm back.

	he sees the troubled look on her face.

					rafe
			maybe i've assumed too much.  has
			something changed?
				(beat)
			i'm afraid to ask what.  and i'm afraid
			not to.
				(beat)
			have you fallen in love?

	she nods; she can't even say it.  rafe's dying inside.

					rafe
			it's all right.  danny always said i see
			things with my emotions instead of my
			eyes.

					evelyn
			it's not your fault, rafe.  the letter i
			wrote you, they --

					rafe
			don't worry about that.  guys away from
			home, lonely, good-hearted women try to
			cheer them up.

					evelyn
			it's not that i didn't mean everything i
			wrote.  it's just that -- i thought you
			were dead.  and now --

	danny runs up, through the darkness.

					danny
			you're alive!

	rafe and danny stare at each other; danny hesitates, looking
	from rafe to evelyn, wondering what they've said.  then rafe
	looks at evelyn, and picks up the look on her face.  in that
	moment he puts it all together.

					rafe
			aw, god.  oh my god.

	danny's speechless, and for a moment evelyn is too.

					evelyn
			rafe --

	he puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly.
	evelyn and danny are left frozen.
