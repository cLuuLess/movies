	ext.  deck of oklahoma - day

	as the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from
	the deck into the water.  still the marines on deck are
	firing back at the planes; some marines are even using
	handguns.  but courage does not save them...

	the oklahoma rolls over

	the men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the
	fires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400
	pound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and
	tumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.

	the sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to
	get away from the suction as the giant battleship turns
	turtle.

	below the water men are sucked down with amazing force, every
	hair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched
	to the depths.

	inside the oklahoma, everyone and everything is spilling
	upside down.  the ship's generators sputter out and the
	lights go out.  the flashlights of the few sailors who can
	find them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills
	in.  there is no escape.

	below the water, the oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom;
	some men are crushed there.  for others it's salvation, as
	the backwash blows them toward the surface.

	on the surface the men are launched almost completely out of
	the water, before splashing back into the water and burning
	oil.  a few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the
	propeller protrude above the surface, but most of the
	oklahoma is under water.

	men in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying
	wounded away from the wreckage.  a bomb hits the launch and
	blows body parts everywhere.
