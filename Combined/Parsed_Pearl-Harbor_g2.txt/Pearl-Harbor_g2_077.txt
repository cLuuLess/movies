	ext.  military base - near the pilots' barracks - day

	danny is walking toward the barracks when a colonel hopping
	mad, confronts him.

					colonel
			you're walker, right?

					danny
			yes sir.

					colonel
			that was a nice little stunt you pulled,
			buzzing the base.

					danny
			you liked that?

					colonel
			oh yeah.  i liked it so much i'm cutting
			you out of the squadron.

					danny
			sir?

					colonel
			i don't buy that hot dog shit.  so you
			and your buddies are gonna transfer your
			planes up to haleiwa.

					danny
			hale-what?

					colonel
			you'll love it.  no base, no bars, just
			lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.

					danny
			sir, i --

					colonel
			too late for apologies, walker.

					danny
			i wasn't gonna apologize, sir.  i was
			just gonna say it was worth it to feel
			like a real pilot again, even if it was
			only for five seconds.

	the colonel glares at him and stalks away.
