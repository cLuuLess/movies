	int.  dentist's office - day

	the dentist, an ethnic japanese, is working on a patient with
	his mouth agape.  the dentist assistant intrudes.

					dental assistant
			dr. takanawa, you have a call from tokyo.

					dentist
			please excuse me.  just relax.

	leaving his patient with a mouth full of instruments, the
	dentist moves to his outer office, which looks directly out
	over pearl harbor.  he speaks in japanese.

					dentist
			takanawa... yes?...

	he seems confused by the call, but he responds by looking out
	over the harbor, then saying into the receiver --

					dentist
			yes, they are all...no wait, i see the
			big one moving.  the one that's flat on
			top, what do they call it?...
