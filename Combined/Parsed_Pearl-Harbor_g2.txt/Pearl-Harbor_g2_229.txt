	int.  bunker - secrecy room - night

	the major opens the door for rafe and danny, then leaves,
	closing it behind him.  doolittle is alone at a desk.  rafe
	and danny walk in and salute.  doolittle motions to the two
	chairs in front of the desk without looking up from the
	papers he's studying.

					doolittle
			i heard what you did.

					rafe
			we can explain, colonel.

					doolittle
			explain what?

					danny
			whatever is was you heard about us.

					doolittle
			you mean the hula shirts you were flying
			in?... or the six planes you shot down?
			you're both being awarded the silver
			star, and promoted to captain.

					rafe
			is that the good new, sir, or --

					doolittle
			you're just about the only pilots in the
			army with actual combat experience, so
			you're volunteering for a mission i've
			been ordered to put together.  do you
			know what top secret is?

					rafe
			well sure, colonel --

					doolittle
			top secret means you help me pick the
			other pilots, train, and go -- without
			knowing where you're going until it's too
			late.

					danny
			you can count on us.

					doolittle
			there's only one other thing i can tell
			you.

	doolittle looks up from his paperwork for the first time.
	his eyes are fierce.

					doolittle
			you won't need any goddamn hula shirts.
