	ext.  deck of oklahoma - day

	two sailors are standing on the deck, sharing a smoke,
	looking out over the quiet harbor.  one of them sees the
	first few planes streaking in.

					sailor 1
			look at that.

					sailor 2
			it's the army again, practicing on us.

	something drops from the lead plane and splashes easily into
	the water; the plane banks away.

					sailor 2
			practice torpedoes.

	a white streak runs through the water at them.

					sailor 2
			now listen, you'll hear a little thud
			when it hits the side of the ship.

	they watch it rush at them...then, a massive explosion!  it
	throws up a fifty foot wall of water, hurling the sailors and
	everything else on the deck into the sea.
