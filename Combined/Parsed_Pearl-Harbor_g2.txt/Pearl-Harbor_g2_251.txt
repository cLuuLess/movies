	int.  hornet - briefing room - day

	doolittle is laying out the plan for all the pilots.

					doolittle
			we'll take off late this afternoon.  i'll
			hit tokyo at dusk, and drop incendiary
			bombs.  you'll come after me at night,
			guided by the fires.  then it's on to
			china, where you'll arrive at dawn,
			guided to their airfields by the homing
			beacons the chinese are going to switch
			on for us.  that's if everything is
			perfect -- like every other military
			mission i've ever been involved with.

	doolittle looks around the room.  no one's smiling.

					doolittle
			listen you guys.  i'm the first plane --
			then mccawley, walker, the rest of you.
			i'll have the shortest run.  if i don't
			make it, you don't go.

					rafe
			colonel...we're all going.  whether you
			make it or not.

					doolittle
			i know.
