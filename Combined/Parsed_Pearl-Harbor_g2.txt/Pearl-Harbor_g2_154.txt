	ext.  road to main airfield - day

	danny and rafe are in danny's buick, hung over and asleep,
	danny in front, rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight
	-- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one
	side of rafe's nose and the corner of danny's mouth.

	the rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the
	rumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation
	makes the sunlight flicker.  danny and rafe squint up, their
	heads pounding, and realize what they're seeing.  suddenly
	their headaches are gone, and danny's gunning the buick down
	the road, toward the base.
