	ext.  oahu - road - night

	danny has pulled his buick convertible off the road; rafe is
	bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up.  danny's
	banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits
	beside rafe, who chokes out between heaves --

					rafe
			how come you're not pukin'?

					danny
			i guess i'm used to it.  i've felt like
			throwing up every minute since you got
			back.

	rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over
	him and he bends over again.  danny looks at his friend, and
	the pain is written on danny's face.

					danny
			don't blame her, rafe.  it's not like
			you're thinking.

					rafe
				(between heaves)
			fuck you.

					danny
			she loves you.  i know that.  and part of
			what she loves in me is how much of you
			she sees in me.

	rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but danny knows he is.

					danny
			we were both torn up.  i started dropping
			by to see her, because we understood what
			each other felt.  we'd have coffee and
			try not to talk about you, but we always
			would.

	rafe stands to face danny; this is hard for danny to say.

					danny
			she said i was so much like you.  i said,
			no, i'm not.  i'm like i am because of
			you, but i'm not you, not as good as you.
			everybody else saw me as a loser with a
			big chip on his shoulder.  but you saw
			the better part of me, the part of me
			that could be like you, and changed me.
			you made me who i am.

					rafe
			how sweet.  is that when you put the move
			on her?

	danny slams his fist into rafe's sick gut.  rafe doubles over
	again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up.

	rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what
	he deserved.  danny's about to apologize when once more rafe
	knees him in the balls.

	danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch.

					rafe
			that's better.

	rafe crawls into the back seat of the car and passes out,
	danny still collapsed at the side of the road.
