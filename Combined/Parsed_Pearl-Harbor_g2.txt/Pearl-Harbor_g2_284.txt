	rafe takes the b-25 right down among the buildings, sometimes
	even having to spin the wings to get through.  the zeros
	can't keep up with this...

	but rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into
	open ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to
	hide...

	the zeros come in to chew him up...

	but they take fire from another b-25 -- danny's -- coming in
	to save rafe's plane.  rafe now uses the radio.

					rafe
			danny, get the hell out of here!

	but danny stays, mixing it up with the zeros; with both
	b-25's together, their machine guns down one zero and damage
	another.  but there are too many.

	rafe sees clouds coming in, and fog.

					rafe
			danny, run for the clouds!

	the bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the zeros
	lose them.
