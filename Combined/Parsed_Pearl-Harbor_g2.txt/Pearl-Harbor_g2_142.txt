	dorie emerges into even greater carnage and confusion.  a
	sailor, his body on fire, runs past and leaps into the oily
	water -- but it is in flames too.

	then dorie sees it:  an unmanned anti-aircraft gun.  he runs
	to it, through the strafing.

	the gun already has a belt of ammo in it -- apparently loaded
	by the gunner who lies beside it with his chest shot open.
	dorie swings the business end of the gun toward the zeros
	coming in out of the smoke, and he begins to fire.

	the zeros keep coming and he keeps firing; nothing on earth
	will knock him from that gun.
