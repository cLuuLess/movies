	int.  presidential conference room - day

	generals, admirals, and other advisors sit around the
	polished table -- all males, in suits and in uniforms.  the
	door opens, and the men all stand.

	president franklin roosevelt appears, in a wheelchair, pushed
	by a huge black valet, george.  the president's legs are
	shriveled, braced with the iron supports that attach to his
	shoes and are apparent beneath the cloth of his pin-striped
	pants.  from the waist up roosevelt is heavily muscled,
	powerful, and handsome even in his little spectacles.  the
	valet rolls him to the head of the table; he's speaking even
	before he settles in.

					president roosevelt
			please be seated, gentlemen.

	they sit, as one.

					president roosevelt
			churchill and stalin are asking me what
			i'm asking you:  how long is america
			going to pretend the world is not at war?

					general marshall
			we've increased supply shipments to them,
			mr. president, and we're losing merchant
			vessels every day.

					president roosevelt
			shift in every destroyer and anti-
			aircraft weapon you can find.

					admiral
			sir, our pacific fleet is already down
			to almost nothing.

					president roosevelt
			gentlemen, at this moment the nation of
			hungry has a larger military then the
			united states.  we have no choice but to
			draw from whatever we can.
