	int.  base canteen - night

	danny and evelyn are having coffee at the base canteen.

					danny
			how's everything?

					evelyn
			we got some soldiers in traction from a
			jeep accident, but it's quiet.  except
			for the occasional fighter plane buzzing
			us.

					danny
			that might not have been such a good
			idea.  they're making us fly out of a
			half-paved airfield.  the real punishment
			is that i won't be back to the barracks
			till it's too late for dinner or coffee.
			so i guess it's goodbye for awhile.

					evelyn
			i was just thinking that war is a series
			of goodbyes.  do you think that's why
			we're meeting.  to help us say goodbye to
			rafe?

					danny
			i swore not to talk about him tonight,
			but there's all this stuff i think i
			ought to tell you, that he didn't get a
			chance to.  rafe was...he was lonely.  he
			had such high expectations of himself
			that he always felt empty.  the week he
			met you he told me he felt his heart had
			always lived in winter, and for the first
			time in his life he has seen the spring.

	he's been lost in his own thoughts of rafe; now he notices
	the tears welling up in her eyes.

					danny
			sorry.

					evelyn
			he told me he didn't want to leave me
			with regret.  now that's all i have.

					danny
			hey, have you seen pearl harbor at night?

					evelyn
			well...sure.

					danny
			from the air?
