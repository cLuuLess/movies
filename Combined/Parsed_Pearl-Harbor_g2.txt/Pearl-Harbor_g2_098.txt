	ext.  pacific ocean - near pearl harbor - night

	another destroyer, the ralph talbot, cruises behind the
	selfridge.  on it's bridge, the duty officer speaks to the
	captain.

					duty officer
			sir, selfridge reports a contact, then
			lost it.  now our sonar reports the
			contact.

	the captain looks toward the selfridge, then trains his
	binoculars on the water were the duty officer points.  he
	sees something dark and black slipping along beneath the
	surface.  he gets onto his intercom.

					captain of the ralph talbot
			radio room!  raise the selfridge.  tell
			the squadron commander we have spotted a
			sub and request permission to depth
			charge.

	he looks again at the black shape, passing a few hundred
	yards from them.

					captain of the ralph talbot
			we're five miles from pearl harbor and
			it's moving in from the open sea.
			prepare to move to attack speed.

	the intercom comes alive.

					intercom
			sir, the squadron commander on selfridge
			denies permission.

					captain of the ralph talbot
			what?

					intercom
			denies, sir.  he says it's a blackfish.

	the captain chokes back his frustration and shuts down the
	intercom -- but then he says to the duty officer, as they
	watch the shape disappear toward pearl harbor...

					captain of the ralph talbot
			if it's a blackfish, it has a motorboat
			up it's ass!
