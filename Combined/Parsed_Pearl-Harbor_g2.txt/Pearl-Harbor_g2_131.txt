	ext.  pearl harbor - day

	quick intercuts - between the approach of the japanese
	planes, and sleepy pearl harbor...

	-- the planes, in formation, their propellers spinning, their
	   engines throbbing...

	-- pearl harbor, with the ships silent, their engines cold,
	   their anchors steady on the harbor bottom.

	-- the japanese submarines heading in.

	-- the american destroyers docking, instead of going out to
	   search for them.

	-- another formation of japanese bombers climbing high, into
	   attack position.

	-- the japanese torpedo planes dropping down to the level of
	   the ocean, their engines beginning to scream.

	-- the american planes bunched on the airfields.

	-- on the japanese carriers, yamamoto and his staff huddle
	   tensely, over their battle maps.

	on the japanese carrier decks, the second wave of planes is
	being brought up and loaded with munitions...the japanese
	flag snaps tautly in the wind...

	on the gold course near pearl harbor, american officers are
	laughing on the putting green near the club house, where the
	american flag droops from the flag pole, limply at peace.

	-- the japanese planes roaring down just over the wave tops
	   of pearl harbor itself.

	-- children playing in the early morning sun, looking up as
	   they see the planes flash by.  the children look --
	   they've never seen this many, flying this low...but they
	   are not alarmed, only curious.

	the images come faster and faster, the collision of japan's
	determination and american's innocence...
