	evelyn sits on danny's lap, like rafe sat in his daddy's lap
	years before.  danny flies easily, the cockpit open, his arms
	slipped under hers.

	dancing around a full moon.

	heads above pearl harbor, gorgeous in the moonlight, the
	battleships aglow, the moon reflected in the peaceful water,
	embraced by the island of oahu.
