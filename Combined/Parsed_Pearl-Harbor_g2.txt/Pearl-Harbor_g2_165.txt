	ext.  above oahu - the dogfight - day

	the japanese planes are in tight, disciplined formation,
	their minds on the targets below them in the harbor.  but
	their day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two p-40's
	blast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into two zeros.  both
	zeros falter and begin to lose altitude.  the p-40's make
	almost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go
	after the two plane they crippled on the first pass.

	rafe finishes one zero, making it explode in a ball of flame
	in the air.  danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing
	so that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.

	the p-40's swoop up again.

					rafe
			they're trying to hold formation.  we can
			chew 'em up!

	the p-40's dig in again, swooping down on the line of zeros.
	rafe hits first, machine gunning one plane, and danny comes
	in behind it, finishing it off.

	the japanese pilots are screaming at each other over their
	radios, but their squadron commander sees pearl harbor ahead,
	and tells them --

					japanese squadron commander
			hold the line!

	the p-40's come through again, their guns spitting fire.
