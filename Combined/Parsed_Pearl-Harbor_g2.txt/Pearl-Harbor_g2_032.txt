	int.  british airfield barracks - night

	rafe sits on his cot, reading her letter.

					evelyn's voice (letter)
			...and send it from my heart to yours.

	rafe is startled as the air commander appears beside his
	bunk.

					british air commander
			air-sea rescue picked up nigel.  he'll be
			back with us tomorrow.

	rafe nods, glad to hear the news.  the commander starts to
	walk away, then turns back.

					british air commander
			some of us look down on the yanks for not
			yet joining this war.  i'd just like to
			say that if there are many more back home
			like you, god help anyone who goes to war
			with america.

	the commander salutes, with his left hand.  and rafe salutes
	too -- with his left hand.
