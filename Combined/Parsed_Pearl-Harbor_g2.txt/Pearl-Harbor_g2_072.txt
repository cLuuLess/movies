	ext.  military base hospital - day

	a young amateur photographer, about 16, wearing a hat with
	"pictures of paradise" printed on it's crown is ready to snap
	a shot of evelyn and her nurse friends having a picnic lunch
	on the lawn outside the hospital.

					photographer
			closer, ladies!  closer!  now smile!...
			great!  next week i'll show you a print
			and you can order your pictures of
			paradise!

	he hustles off.  betty hands out picnic baskets.

					betty
			barbara, here's yours...and evelyn, here
			you are.

	evelyn opens her basket, and finds a lei of hawaiian flowers
	stuffed in the top.  betty scoots over and puts the flowers
	around evelyn's neck.

					betty
			it's been a month and you haven't smiled.
			we just want you to know we love you.

	evelyn's touched -- but before she can react two p-40's zoom
	out of the skies, wings clipping the tops of the palm trees
	as they blast over head.
