	rafe's bombardier works his 20-cent bombsight, as rafe holds
	the plane steady, bringing it up to 200 feet.

	they scan for fighter or anti-aircraft fire.  there isn't
	any.

	the bombardier hits the first switch.  the bomb falls toward

	it strikes home, right on target.  the blast is shocking --
	it blows debris higher than the plane.
