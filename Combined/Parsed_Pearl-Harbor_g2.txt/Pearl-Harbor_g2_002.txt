	ext.  new jersey air base - day

	american p-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming
	and wind singing by their wings.

	there are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we
	focus on two:  rafe mccawley has grown lean and handsome.
	and danny walker is very much the same.

	their planes start swapping positions in the formation; while
	the other guys are flying along in a tight line, rafe and
	danny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,
	the other diving and coming back up in his place,
	leapfrogging.

	it scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and
	out, so close.  the training captain, watching through
	binoculars on the ground, talks into his radio --

					training captain
			mccawley!  walker!  cut that out!

					rafe
			i thought this was a training flight.
			i'm just trying to give danny some
			training.

					danny
			not on your best day, boy!

	rafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction
	he was moving before.  danny reacts almost instantly...
	leapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out
	of everybody else.

					training captain
			that's it, get into a wedge!

	the squadron responds, forming up into a tight v, rafe and
	danny just behind and on either side of the center.

					rafe
			didn't you say test the limits?

					danny
			hey, you wanna test my limits, you better
			line up a couple dozen women on the
			ground...cause i got no limits in the
			air!

	rafe grins, loving the challenge.  then he and danny do the
	leapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the v.

					training captain
			everybody down!
