	ext.  outdoor restaurant - oahu - day

	evelyn is off duty, and wears a light cotton dress.  she's
	let her hair down, and her skin has the sheen of light sweat
	in the tropical heat.

	the restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood
	posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor.
	evelyn sits alone.  she's brought writing paper.  as the
	hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with
	chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at
	the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.

	but before she can start to write, three naval officers move
	over to her table from the bar.  they're out of uniform too,
	wearing garish tropical shirts.

					navy guy 1
			a woman beautiful as you shouldn't be
			sitting alone.  buy you a drink?

					evelyn
			thank you...ensign.

	the guys look at each other, impressed that she could tell.

					navy guy 1
			ensign!  smart too!

					navy guy 2
			so how about that drink?  or dinner?

					evelyn
			thank you, but...i really want to be
			alone right now.

					navy guy 3
			want to see something long and hard?

	he shows her the tattoo of an anchor on his forearm.  evelyn
	looks away from them, toward the harbor.

					evelyn
			i'm sorry.  i've got a letter to write.

					navy guy 3
			cold bitch.

	his friends start to pull him away, but evelyn's eyes flare.

					evelyn
			what did you say?

					navy guy 3
			i said you're cold.

					evelyn
			cold?  no, i'm just thinking about a war.
			and maybe you should be too.

	they leave, shaking their heads.  evelyn picks up her pen,
	and writes.

					evelyn's voice (letter)
			dear rafe... it's strange to be so far
			from you in body, and so close to you in
			spirit.  but if our spirits really give
			our bodies life, then you should know
			this:  every night i look at the sunset,
			and try to draw the last ounce of heat
			from its long day...

	she looks toward the sunset now; then she writes again...
