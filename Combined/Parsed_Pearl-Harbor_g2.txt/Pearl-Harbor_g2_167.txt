	ext.  the flight of the bomb - day

	we stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky.  the small
	propeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the
	arming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core.  the bomb
	wobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins
	stabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying
	rate, toward the arizona.

	it slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like
	matchsticks.

	it's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next
	deck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward
	the powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are
	waiting.

	the bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond
	comprehension.  over 1400 men die instantly.
