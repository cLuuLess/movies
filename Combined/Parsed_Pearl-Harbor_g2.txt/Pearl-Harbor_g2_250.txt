	ext.  flight deck - the hornet - day

	the preparations begin.  deck crews move the b-25's to the
	rear of the flight deck.  fueling teams top off the bomber's
	gas tanks.  ordnance men hoist four bombs into each aircraft,
	and the army gunners load ammunition for the machine guns.
	greening checks the planes' mechanical and hydraulic systems.

	and once again the pilots are out pacing the deck distance.
	it's turned into a game for them, walking off nerves.  as
	rafe and danny pass.

					rafe
			it's not getting any longer.

					danny
			longer?  it's getting shorter.
