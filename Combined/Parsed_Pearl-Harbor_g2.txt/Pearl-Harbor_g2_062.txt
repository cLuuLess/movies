	ext.  japanese bombing practice - japanese island - day

	the japanese have constructed a replica of pearl harbor on
	their practice island; erecting new target barriers and
	silhouettes of the various ships anchored at pearl.  streams
	of japanese planes skim overhead in practice bombing runs,
	dropping dummy torpedoes and bombs.  from a control platform
	erected on the beach, yamamoto and genda oversee it all.

					yamamoto
			everything real except the fact that no
			one is shooting back at us.

					genda
			if we achieve surprise, they will offer
			little resistance.

					yamamoto
			set up teams of radio operators to send
			out messages the americans will
			intercept, concerning every potential
			american target in the pacific.  include
			hawaii -- the clutter will be more
			confusing that way.

					genda
			brilliant, admiral.

					yamamoto
			a brilliant man would find a way not to
			fight a war.

	he looks out at the planes roaring into his practice harbor
	at top speed...
