	int.  a moving train - day

	the trains of 1942 have their own beauty, with felt seats,
	shaded lamps, and paneled compartments even in the economy
	section.  but the glow of the train is outshone by evelyn
	stewart.  she's one of ten young women, army nurses, gathered
	at one end of the car as it rattles along the track.

	the other nurses are pretty and ripe -- maybe a bit too
	ripe.  their lips painted bright red, their faces powdered,
	their spirits high.

	evelyn listens in amusement to betty, a cute blonde with
	unmissable boobs, and barbara, a burnette equally endowed.

					betty
			do you have trouble with your boobs in
			the uniform?

					barbara
			you mean hiding them?

					betty
			hide them?  on a date with pilots?  i'm
			talking about how you make them show!

	sandra, another nurse, speaks up.

					sandra
			loan 'em to me, i'll make 'em show.

					betty
			the boobs or the pilots?

	the girls laugh and shove each others' knees; it's a party
	wherever they go.  but evelyn can't keep her mind on the
	frivolity.  she looks out the window and her thoughts drift
	away.

					barbara
			we'll ask evelyn.  evelyn?  evelyn!

					betty
			ooo, she's thinking of her date!  come
			on, you've been dating a pilot.  we want
			to know what we can expect.

	suddenly all the girlish faces are looking at evelyn.

					evelyn
			i've been dating one pilot.  and only for
			a few weeks.  but i know he's different
			from all the others.

	sandra throws up her arms and swoons onto her friends.

					sandra
			true love!...

					betty
			morphine, give her morphine!

					barbara
			give her an enema.

					evelyn
			but i do have a warning for you.  there's
			one line you all need to know, and you're
			likely to hear it from any man in a
			uniform.  it goes like this:  "honey,
			baby... we never know what's gonna happen,
			and i may die tomorrow...so, let's live
			all we can tonight."

	a silence among the nurses.

					barbara
			i tell you.  any one of those arrogant,
			leather-jacketed, slick-lookin' flyboys
			tries that line on me...he's gonna get
			anything he wants.

	as the nurses laugh --
