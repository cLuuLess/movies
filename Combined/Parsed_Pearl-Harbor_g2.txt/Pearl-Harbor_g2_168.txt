	ext.  pearl harbor - day

	the battleship arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine
	is broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant.
	men on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already
	floating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but
	there are almost no survivors.

	the concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship
	vestal, next to the arizona, saving vestal, as the explosion
	snuffs out the fires on vestal; it also sends tons of debris
	down on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads
	of men, all sorts of bodies.

	debris from the arizona also cover the tennessee and does
	more damage than the two japanese bombs that hit her.
