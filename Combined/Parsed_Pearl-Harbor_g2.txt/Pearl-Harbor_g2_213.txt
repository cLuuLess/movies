	ext.  pearl harbor - night

	rafe and danny reach the west virginia's pier, but in the
	darkness, they can't find anything.  they stop a naval
	officer.

					danny
			where is the west virginia?

					officer
			there.

	he points; the battleship has sunk, its superstructure barely
	showing above the water.

	it looks hopeless to find a single sailor here; but then they
	see a powerful black sailor, pulling to the dock with a
	dinghy full of dead men retrieved from the water.  as workers
	unload the bodies, the black sailor sits down, exhausted
	physically and emotionally, his head in his hands.  rafe and
	danny approach him.

					danny
			we're looking for dorie miller.

					dorie
			that's me, sir.

					rafe
			a friend of ours wanted to be sure you're
			alive.  evelyn.  a nurse.

					dorie
			how is she?

					danny
			like we all are.

	miller nods, and looks out over the harbor, a hellish place
	where black smoke still hangs over everything, the shattered
	remains of men and ships still in the harbor.  it's total
	devastation.  and yet something about that scene stirs
	something else in dorie miller.

					dorie
			there's something out there i need to
			get.  will you help me?
