	ext.  air above oahu - day

	the nose of danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and
	he sees the sudden devastation of the arizona.  it is a sight
	so awesome it freezes him for a moment.

	a zero comes up behind him, firing.  danny jerks his stick to
	maneuver but he's caught...

	rafe comes in behind the zero, chopping it up, even as he
	yells at danny over the radio --

					rafe
			ain't no time for spectatin'!

	they turn back after the line of zeros.  there are some
	japanese planes coming after them now, but the p-40's head at
	their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and
	turn right back into the japanese formation.

	rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a
	short burst before stopping.

					rafe
			i'm out of ammo!

					danny
			i'm out of fuel!

	they head back.  a single zero is on their way.  rafe charges
	it and draws its fire; danny comes in behind the zero and
	rakes its cockpit; the japanese pilot backs off.

	the p-40's dive back toward haleiwa.

	a handful of zeros returning from pearl see them and follow.
