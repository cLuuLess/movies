	int.  funky oahu bar - later

	they're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking.  rafe
	uses glasses to show his buddies tactics.

					rafe
			they'll go under you because their planes
			are faster, then they run so you can't
			catch 'em.  but then they'll come around
			and take you from behind -- like some
			americans will.

	the last words bring the group to silence.  the other guys
	drift away, to give them room.

					rafe
			sorry.

					danny
			why be sorry?  that's what you feel, it's
			better to come out with it.

					rafe
			i didn't mean it.

					danny
			sure you did.  so come on.  say what you
			think.

					rafe
			waitress!  four beers!

					danny
			you don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.

					rafe
			if you can't keep up, don't drink yours.

	the waitress delivers four bottles to the table.  rafe takes
	a slow sip, then stares at danny.

					rafe
			we gotta face some facts here.

					danny
			what facts are those?

					rafe
			i understand how it could happen.  i know
			why any guy would love her.  and i can't
			blame you that it happened.  you thought
			i was dead, she was grieving, you were
			trying to help her.

					danny
			i was grieving too.

					rafe
			yeah, right.  anyway, you didn't know.

					danny
			so what are you saying?

					rafe
			i'm saying now you do know.  so it's time
			for you to fuck off.

					danny
			you left her.  how's that for a fact?

					rafe
			how's this for a fact?  i loved her
			first.

	danny takes a long pull of beer, and rafe does the same.

					danny
			you know, you're a lousy drinker.
			drinking's supposed to make men feel
			bigger.  it only makes you stupid.  and
			weak.

	rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.

					rafe
			how's this?

	bam!  he knocks danny out of the chair, flat on his ass.
	danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.

					danny
			you want it, you got it.

	he kicks rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in
	the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on.

	the bar's bouncer, a big samoan, moves over to break them up
	-- but anthony steps in his way.

					anthony
			let 'em fight, they need it.

	the bouncer tosses anthony aside, but before he can move in
	to interrupt the fight, red breaks a lava volcano of mai-tai
	over the bouncer's skull.  the bartender picks up the phone
	to call the m.p.'s.

	rafe and danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the
	room.  sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their
	stools to watch the action.  the other pilots are wincing
	with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and
	weaving as if in the fight themselves.  a sailor tapes billy.

					sailor
			is this a private fight or can anybody
			jump in?

	billy hits him.  the whole bar erupts.

	rafe and danny are really having at it, fueled by so much
	emotion that nothing hurts.  they're on the floor now, trying
	to rip each other apart.  they struggle to their feet and
	rafe manages to knee danny in the balls.  danny doubles over
	in pain.

					rafe
			that hurt?  i didn't think you had any
			balls.

	without looking up, danny lunges at rafe, tackling him around
	the waist, driving him at the wall.

	but they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back
	window of the bar -- not covered in glass, but fronds and
	wood -- and out into the back alley.

	they're lying there in the debris when they see the m.p.
	jeeps coming.  they drag each other to their feet, and run
	away.
