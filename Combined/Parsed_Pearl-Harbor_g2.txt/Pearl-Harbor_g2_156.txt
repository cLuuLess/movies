	ext.  the oklahoma - still at anchor - day

	the number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their
	strategy flawless.  torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull
	with a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush
	under and hit the next ship anchored behind.  the american
	battleships are bobbing like see-saws.

	the oklahoma takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing
	thirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately
	begins to list.
