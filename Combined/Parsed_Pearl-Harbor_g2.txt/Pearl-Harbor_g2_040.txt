	staff.

			...transfer twelve more destroyers to
			atlantic fleet, and all the available
			anti-aircraft weaponry?!  washington has
			gone insane!

	kimmel's strategic analyst speaks up.

					strategic analyst
			we've done what you ordered, admiral, and
			war gamed the likely outcome of a
			japanese attack against each of our major
			bases in the pacific.  wake, guam,
			midway, the philippines.  in each case,
			we lose.

					admiral kimmel
			you left out hawaii.

					strategic analyst
			pearl harbor can't be attacked
			effectively from the air.  it's too
			shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.
			pearl harbor's safe.  it's everywhere
			else that we're vulnerable.

					admiral kimmel
			step up surveillance of japanese
			communications.  they're gonna do
			something somewhere.  i can feel it.
