	int.  below decks of the west virginia - day

	dorie carries the captain down the ladder by himself, using
	one arm to climb and one to hold the captain like a child's
	teddy bear.  when they reach the bottom the pain has grown
	too much for the captain; he know's he's dying.

					captain of the west virginia
			put me down here.

	dorie puts him down; the medic jumps down the ladder and
	reaches the captain, who tells him --

					captain of the west virginia
			find my executive officer and tell him
			he's in command.  tell him to fire the
			boilers and...

	he trembles in death throes...

					captain of the west virginia
			make sure the gunners have enough
			ammuni --

	he's dead.  the medic runs toward the ladder, reaches the
	hatch, and is blasted back to the bottom by an explosion
	overhead.

	dorie runs for the ladder, and climbs out into hell.
