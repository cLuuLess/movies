	ext.  hornet - flight deck - stripping the planes - day

	it's starting to rain but the guys don't notice at all.
	they're stripping seats out of the planes, tossing out their
	own gear.

	greening pulls the machine guns out of the rear of the planes
	and puts in broomsticks painted black.

	off in the distance the japanese patrol boat takes a hit and
	explodes.  rafe and danny meet between their bombers.

					danny
			broomsticks instead of tail guns.

					rafe
			we'll get separated over the target, but
			you and i will rendezvous for the run to
			china.  i'm on your wing.

					danny
			and i'm on yours.  land of the free.

					rafe
			home of the brave.

	they climb into their bombers.
