	ext.  japanese aircraft carriers - night

	the first wave of japanese planes begins to launch.  it is a
	stirring sight for the japanese; the pilots waiting in their
	cockpits, the officers watching from the bridge, the seamen
	on the flight deck.

	the first plane taxis along the flight deck and lifts into
	the sky.  the seamen cheer and wave their caps.
