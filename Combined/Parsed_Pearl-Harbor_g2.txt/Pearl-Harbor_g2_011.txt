	int./ ext.  train - new york train station - night

	the nurses start stepping out; both pilots and nurses pretend
	surprise to see each.  at the door of the train, evelyn
	whispers to betty --

					evelyn
			stick with me, i'll find you somebody
			good.

	betty spot's rafe.

					betty
			i'll take that one.

					evelyn
			he's taken.  but come on, i'll introduce
			you.

	they move to rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his
	eyes holding evelyn.

					rafe
			hello, lieutenant.  good to see you.

					evelyn
			you too, lieutenant.

	betty clears her throat.

					evelyn
			oh, this is betty.

					rafe
			nice to meet you, betty.

	he draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two
	roses.  he hands one to evelyn and the second to betty.

					rafe
			danny would'a brought this.

	he escorts them along the platform.

					evelyn
			danny's not coming?

					rafe
			no, he...got some news today.  he'll be
			okay, he just didn't feel like coming
			tonight.

					evelyn
			i was hoping to meet him.

					betty
			i was hoping to meet him.

					rafe
			we'll just have to find a substitute,
			won't we?

	betty stops, and faces rafe.

					betty
			i just want to tell you one thing.  if
			you're thinking this might be your last
			night on earth?... i'm prepared to make
			it meaningful.
				(leaning close)
			very meaningful.

					evelyn
			at ease, betty!
