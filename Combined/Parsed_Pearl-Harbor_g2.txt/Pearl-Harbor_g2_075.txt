	ext.  military base hospital - pearl harbor - evening

	evelyn walks out of the hospital.  she's still wearing her
	lei.  the sun is going down in a spectacular sunset.

	she stares at the orange glow at the edge of the world.  she
	breathes in the sea air, and tries to breathe out the
	sadness.  the water of the harbor laps close to where she
	stands, the sunset polishing its surface.

	she takes the lei from her neck, plucks a single flower, and
	holds it like the rose rafe once gave her.  then she tosses
	the rest of the lei into the ocean and watches it float away,
	as the sun sinks behind the horizon.
