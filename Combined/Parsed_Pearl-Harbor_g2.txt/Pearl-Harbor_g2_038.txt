	ext.  pearl harbor - airfield - day

	danny and his buddies stride up to the airfield.  it's full
	of fighter planes -- and they're all bunched together in
	clusters on the field.  danny grabs a mechanic.

					danny
			hey!  what is this, the planes all
			bunched up like that?

					mechanic
			the brass is afraid of sabotage.  this
			makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier
			to service.

					danny
			what about easier to hit in an air raid?

					mechanic
			who's gonna to that?  japan is four
			thousand miles away.  so you guys just
			arrived, huh?

					danny
			yeah.

					mechanic
			we got a saying here.  a-low-ha!

	the mechanic walks off.  danny and the guys are left standing
	on the tarmac.

					danny
			well guys...i reckon there's just one
			thing to do...
