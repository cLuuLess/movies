75   ext. alley (east baltimore) - sara and chenille - night     75

     gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse.
     chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to
     get inside.

                                 chenille
                  rope dopes.   c'mon.

     she leads sara to the door of feetz. the sumo-sized man
     guarding it knows chenille, digs her. his grin exposes
     gold-capped teeth.

                               doorman
               chenille.    lookin' fine.   as
               always.

                             chenille
               too fine to stand in line?

     the man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being
     just inside the front door. a bouncer there collects the
     $10.00 cover charge. checks their i.d. he hands sara's
     back with a smirk.

                             bouncer
               changed your hair.

     he waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet
     another bouncer who escorts sara and chenille through yet
     another door.


76   another angle                                               76

     they march a short distance to an old elevator where a
     group of kids wait. bouncer #2 engages the elevator.
     everyone piles in.
