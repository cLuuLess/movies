116   int. patrick's house - kitchen - night                           116

      momma dean's fixing dinner. patrick enters with the mail
      in his teeth, a load of books in his arms. he dumps the
      books on the counter, busses momma dean's check on the
      way to the 'fridge.

                                 momma dean
                   i know you're not puttin' those
                   dirty hands inside my
                   refrigerator.

      patrick  backs up to the sink. washes his hands.
      impishly  dries them on her apron. he sits, begins
      sifting  through the mail. momma dean pulls an envelope
      from her  pocket. waves it at him.

                                 momma dean
                   this what you're lookin' for?

      chenille appears in the doorway. patrick takes the
      letter. he's almost afraid to open it. but he does.
      and as he reads the letter, a slyly relieved smile
      spreads across his face. he tosses the letter in the
      air. grabs chenille and momma dean. and the three of
      them jump up and down together with joy.
