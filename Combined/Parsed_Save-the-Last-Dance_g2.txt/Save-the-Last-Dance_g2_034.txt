57   int. roy's apartment - sara's "room" - night                  57

     sara's moving the partition around, trying to make her
     room more like a room. trying to build another wall
     between her and roy.

                                                   (continued)

                                                               26.

                                 roy (o.s.)
                  hey, sara.   c'mere a minute.

     sara lets out a heavy sigh.        what does he want?

                                 sara
                  what?

                             roy (o.s.)
               just come here.

     she walks into the kitchen. roy's in front of the open
     freezer door. grinning from ear to ear. he motions her
     over. sara crosses to the freezer. looks inside.


     insert - inside freezer

     it's full of frozen dinners.       they're in unruly, lopsided
     stacks.


     back to scene

     roy regards her expectantly.

                                roy
                  hungry and healthys. i asked at
                  the market. they're the best.
                  so. what do you feel like?
                         (whimsically)
                  lamb chop suey? tropical tuna?
                  primavera paradise?

                                sara
                  i had a big lunch.

     roy, deflated, closes the freezer door, trails her into
     the living area. sara's clenching again. there's no
     escaping him.

                                roy
                  what do you wanna do? you wanna
                  hang out with me? go to my gig.
                  you can if you want.

                                sara
                  it's a school night, roy.

                                 roy
                  right.   school night.    got it.

                                                            27.
