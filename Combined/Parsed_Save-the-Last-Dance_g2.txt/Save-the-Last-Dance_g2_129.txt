173   ext./int. street - bmw - driving - night                     173

      rap music blasts on the radio. no one in the car is
      saying anything. malakai has a "40" between his legs.
      he sips from it, passes it to patrick. patrick takes a
      short swig, passes it back to lip. as he does this, a
      set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap. patrick
      picks them up. looks at the key chain, his present from
      sara. he looks at malakai.

                             patrick
               pull over.
                      (as malakai glances at
                       him, not understanding)
               this ain't helpin' nobody, 'kai.
               i'm out. i mean it. stop the
               car.

                                 lip
               awww, shit.      here we go.

                             malakai
                      (furious)
               what you mean you out? you think
               i'ma let your punk ass bail on me
               again?

      patrick starts to open the door. malakai speeds up. the
      car careens down the street, squeals around corners.
      finally comes to a red light. stops. patrick starts to
      open the door. malakai grabs him by the jacket. pulls
      his gun. patrick looks at malakai and now he sees him.
      sees that he's lost and desperate... and dangerous.

                                                  (continued)

                                                                 114.

                                 patrick
                   what you gonna do, 'kai? you
                   gonna shoot me? go ahead! you'll
                   have to!

                                  lip
                   let him out!   we don't need him.

                              malakai
                shut the fuck up.

      patrick jerks himself loose. opens the door. malakai
      cocks the gun. patrick's face flinches at the sound of
      it. he can feel it trained on his back as he gets out
      the car. but malakai can't do it. wouldn't do it. he
      takes off like a bat out of hell.
