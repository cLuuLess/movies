66   int. chemistry lab - minutes later                            66

     the class, in safety goggles and gloves, has partnered
     up.


     angle on sara and patrick

     he's holding two vials. sara picks up a beaker. stares
     at the blackboard. she has no idea -- and no intention
     of admitting it.

                             patrick
                      (very casually)
               that's too big.

     she glints at him, grits through her teeth.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                30.

66   continued:                                                       66

                                sara
                  i know it's too big.

     she puts the beaker down. picks up a vial. flips
     through her textbook. her eyes shift from it to the
     blackboard, trying to make a connection. she settles on
     one. picks up a vial of powder. patrick grabs her hand,
     leans over and whispers.

                            patrick
              i wouldn't do that if i were you.

                            sara
                     (yanks her hand back)
              who died and made you teacher?

     patrick pulls back, looks at her. he can't believe she
     dissed him. a small smile forms on his face. sara turns
     away from it, goes back to her vials. patrick slides to
     the farthest end of the table. watches her consternation
     with bemusement.

                            patrick
              know the difference between ethyl
              glycol and methyl acetate? both
              got three elements, two parts the
              same. it's that first part, c2
              versus c3. c3 could blow a vial
              right out a person's hand.

     sara thinks he's messing with her. but then the contents
     of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. panicked, she
     drops the vial into their sink. it instantly goes up in
     smoke. some of the liquid splashes on sara's lab coat.
     patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. the
     class stops cold. hill rushes up to them. once he's
     sure sara's fine, he looks sternly at patrick.

                                mr. hill
              what happened?      everybody back in
              your seats!

     patrick stares at sara.     her face is red.     she's biting
     her lip.

                                patrick
                  i misread the component.

                                mr. hill
                         (even more angry now)
                  you? you misread a component.
                  don't give me that, patrick. you
                  were screwin' around!

                                                      (continued)

                                                                31.

66   continued:                                                       66

     hill's tone is searing. he turns to     sara. she's trying
     to say something but the words won't    come out. hill
     regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious
     class back to their stations. sara     looks at patrick,
     weakly mouths "thanks."
