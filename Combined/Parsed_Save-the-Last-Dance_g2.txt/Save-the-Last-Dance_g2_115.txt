159   int. dance studio - sara and patrick - morning             159

      practice her free form, a hip-hop ballet hybrid. they're
      both tired, irritable, beaten down. they've been there
      awhile. sara makes a misstep. patrick stops. cold.
      sara grits on him.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                   103.

                                 sara
                   we should keep going.

                                    patrick
                   you messed up.

                                 sara
                   i know i messed up. i'll get it
                   right the next time.

                             patrick
               no. you gonna get it right now so
               you can do it perfect next time.

      she glares at him, exasperated.         so many things bottled
      up.

                                 sara
                   i can't work like this.      i can't
                   dance like this.

                                patrick
               like what?

                                sara
               like this.     you dictating to me.

      he crosses the room, cuts off the music. looks at her.
      sara walks over to a window seat near him. flops down.

                                 patrick
                   what's wrong, sara?

                                 sara
                   nothing's wrong.
                          (except)
                   i can't figure things out.

                                 patrick
                   what things? the audition? you
                   ain't got nothin' to worry about.
                   i told you. i'll be there.

                                 sara
                   things, patrick. things between
                   us. things between us and them.

                             patrick
               i didn't know there was a 'them.'

                                 sara
                   well, open your pretty brown eyes,
                   look the hell around.
                                 (more)

                                                          (continued)

                                                               104.

                                 sara (cont'd)
                          (he's so nonplussed)
                   everything's screwed up. nobody
                   wants to see us together, not even
                   chenille. i don't know why they
                   feel that way. how can i know?
                   maybe they have a point, patrick.

                                 patrick
                   they only got a point if you
                   believe they got a point, sara.

      she looks at him... and loves him... and doesn't know
      what to do.

                                 sara
                   i'm just saying that we should
                   think about this, that's all.

                                 patrick
                   that's a fuckin' 'nough.

                                 sara
                   why are you getting mad?

                                 patrick
                   because i like to think for
                   myself, run my own life, and i
                   thought you did too.

      sara looks at him.     now she's getting mad.

                                 sara
                   you're never gonna run your own
                   life as long as you keep running
                   back to malakai every time he
                   fucks up or fucks you over.

      she's crossed the line. but patrick responds so
      deliberately, so calmly prosaic, that she doesn't
      immediately realize it...

                                 patrick
                   first of all, malakai ain't never
                   fucked me over. second of all,
                   you don't know him, sara, what he
                   been through. matter of fact, you
                   don't know shit about none of it.
                   so don't come off to me like you
                   do.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                105.

159   continued:                                                       159

                                 sara
                   i know he's lost, patrick!
                   everybody but you can see that.
                   and if you keep reaching back for
                   him, you're gonna wind up lost
                   too.

      ... until he erupts.

                                 patrick
                   who the fuck are you to say he's
                   lost? malakai had my back when
                   you were busy gee-whizzin' in the
                   woods with your backward-ass,
                   redneck friends.

                             sara
               they weren't rednecks!

      patrick yanks his boombox off the floor, glares at her.

                                    patrick
                   you know what?     the hell with you.

      sara yells after him.     her voice echoes in the empty
      studio.

                                 sara
                   the hell with you too!
