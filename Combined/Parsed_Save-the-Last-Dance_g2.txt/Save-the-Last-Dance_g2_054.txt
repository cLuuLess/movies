80   int. feetz - bar - same time                                        80

     chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging sara along.
     a tall, angular twenty-something man on the far side of
     the bar sees her. she sees him. sucks her teeth, nudges
     sara.

                                  chenille
              that's him.        comin' over.   kenny?
              don't look.

     so of course sara does. she makes a silly face at
     chenille as kenny sidles up to her. chenille rolls her
     eyes half-heartedly.

                                  kenny (man)
              what's up?

                            chenille
              where's my money, kenny?

                                kenny
                  i'm a little short this week.
                  don't jump off. it's comin'.

                                  chenille
                  it's comin'?    no. you lyin'.

                                kenny
                  lemme rap to you about the
                  situation on the dance floor.

     she shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. she's
     in love with him. enough to let him whisper in her ear,
     sweet-talk her away from the bar. before she's swallowed
     up by the crowd, chenille turns back to sara, shouts:

                                  chenille
                  rum and coke.    no ice.   hook me
                  up.


     on patrick

     splitting off from malakai and a girl clinging to him.
     he's walking through when nikki appears from nowhere,
     grabs his arm.

                                  nikki
                  let's dance.

                                patrick
                         (pulling away)
                  let's not.

                                                         (continued)

                                                                 42.

80   continued:                                                        80

                                 nikki
                  oh?   it's gonna be like that.

                                patrick
                  how'd you think it was gonna be?
                  that you was gonna drop me and
                  pick me up whenever you felt like
                  it?

                                nikki
                  it ain't all that serious,
                  patrick.

                                patrick
                  it ain't anymore, nikki.     not to
                  me.

     he walks off. camera tracks him going deep inside the
     club. he wants a drink. he's almost at the bar when he
     sees chenille on the dance floor with kenny. she shrugs
     a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. toward
     sara. the look is like, help me out. don't let me leave
     her hangin'. patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at
     sara, before he really sees her. she looks fly. hugely
     fly. he ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's
     ear.

                                sara
                  rum and coke, straight up. and a
                  beer. i don't care. anything.

                                patrick (o.s.)
              bad choice.      'anything.'

     the closeness of his voice startles her. she turns into
     his smile. that cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees
     smile.

                                sara
                  it's just a beer.

                                patrick
                  then it should be the best beer.
                  you'd know that if you really
                  drank.

     sara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens.         the
     asshole's back.

                                 sara
                  whatever.

                                patrick
                  what's that mean? whatever.

                                                        (continued)

                                                            43.

80   continued:                                                   80

                                sara
                  whatever you want it to mean.
                  you're the whiz kid, right? you
                  know everything.

                            patrick
                     (chuckles at this, at
                      her)
              not everything. like i don't know
              why we're standin' still.
                     (closer with a teasing
                      whisper)
              i'm supposed to be dizzy by now.
              remember? from all those circles
              you danced around me.

     sara leans against the bar.    the knees are going again.

                             sara
               i don't feel like dancing.

                             patrick
               but you do know how...?

                             sara
               would i be here if i didn't?

                             patrick
               ... let's do it then.    c'mon.

     he coaxes her onto the dance floor. parliament's funk
     classic "flashlight" is playing. the dance crowd is
     robustly singing the refrain to the song. there's a
     party on the floor. favor sara and patrick, facing each
     other. he's moving already. she starts to dance,
     stiffly, tentatively. patrick smiles at her. shakes his
     head. he grabs her hands, swings them in time to the
     music.

                             patrick
               now move your hips. not so fast.
                      (as sara looks lost)
               sara! just like our hands.
                      (singing, in sync with
                       the crowd)
               'flashlight! neon light! stop
               light! everybody got a little
               light under the sun.'

     the music's beginning to feel good to sara. patrick lets
     go of her hands. starts to dance. sara watches him
     intensely, her body follows his stiffly. patrick's a
     good teacher. he leads without leaving her. whenever
     she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into
     another less-complicated one.
                                                (continued)

                                                             44.

80   continued:                                                    80

     sara begins to pick-up on patrick's rhythm. her eyes
     never wander from his. and then she starts to feel
     something else. they both do. a rising beat. a
     quickening heart. and not from the dancing. she smiles
     bashfully at him. patrick suddenly grabs her around the
     waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. all sara
     can do is try to keep up and hang on.


     from another angle

     nikki avidly watching sara and patrick with jasmin and
     tiff'ny.

                                jasmin
                  she's all up in your nut, nikki...
                  oh, that's right. it ain't your
                  nut anymore.

                                nikki
                  it is if i want it to be. he is
                  if i want him to be. that bitch
                  ain't got shit on me.

     the girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence.
     nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is
     pricking.
