97   int./ext. car wash - day                                      97

     patrick, in coveralls, slouches over a mechanic's station
     studying. a few workers mill about, waiting for the next
     car on a slow day. a bmw with tinted windows peels into
     the lot on two wheels. patrick looks up as malakai and a
     tall, wiry, nattily dressed man get out.

                                patrick
               i got it.

     he exits into the lot.    approaches malakai and the man
     ("tute").

                                malakai
               medicine man.     you know tute.

     tute takes in patrick.    looks around.   snickers
     derisively.

                             tute
               you call this a job, man?

                             patrick
               actually, i call it a car wash.
               the work i do, yeah, that's a job.

     malakai lets out a nervous laugh.     tute doesn't crack a
     smile.

                              tute
               i need some sticks.    watch my
               ride, malakai.

     tute enters the cashier's office.    patrick looks at
     malakai.

                             patrick
               you hangin' with him now?    think
               that's a good idea, 'kai?

                             malakai
               you got a better one?

                             patrick
               you could try layin' all this shit
               off for awhile. give yourself a
               chance on the other side.

                             malakai
               what other side?

                             patrick
               you know what i mean. it ain't
               like you don't have good sense.

                                                    (continued)

                                                               58.

97   continued:                                                      97

                                malakai
                  i got sense enough to know who i
                  am, what i can do and where i can
                  do it. i ain't like you. people
                  don't just up and hand me shit.

     tute emerges from cashier's office lighting a cigarette
     from a fresh pack. he blows a plume of smoke into the
     air, regards patrick.

                             tute
               we ain't here for our health.     you
               workin', then work.
                      (throws patrick
                       car keys)
               and don't forget the rims.
