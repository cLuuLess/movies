133   int. feetz - bar - night                                       133

      usual suspects, usual music. patrick hands sara a call-
      brand beer. leans in with his drink, openly and
      contently with her.


      another angle

      nikki and her crew (jasmin, tiff'nee, alyssa). nikki
      hasn't seen patrick and sara. she's showing her crew a
      dance.


      another angle

      chenille, diggy and another black girl.     fraternizing.


      another angle - deejay booth

      a chrome-domed deejay with a barry white baritone bellows
      into his mike as he changes the music.

                              deejay
                master p with the 'ghetto d'.
                showmesomethin', showmesomethin',
                give up that cruel. eyes on you!

      wider as the dance floor swells with kids. pick up sara
      and patrick among them. she looks at him nervously. he
      smiles.

                              patrick
                nobody's watchin' you but me.

      a gallant lie. sara tries    to believe it. they dance.
      practice has made her near   perfect. their movements are
      ambitious, nimble, better   than anyone else on the floor.
      they move so well together   that snookie, dancing nearby,
      starts chanting:

                                snookie
                go, patrick!    go, patrick!

                                                      (continued)

                                                                 80.

133   continued:                                                       133

      from another angle of dance floor

      diggy.     jiggling and wildly gyrating.   chiming in --

                                  diggy
                   go, sara!   go, sara!


      patrick and sara

      building up a sweat; confidently dancing at fever pitch.

                                deejay (v.o.)
                  everybody have funk, funk, funk!
