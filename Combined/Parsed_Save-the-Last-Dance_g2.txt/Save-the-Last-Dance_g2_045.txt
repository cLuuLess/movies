70   ext. "black" street (south baltimore) - night                70

     sara. in a skin-tight miniskirt and a bolero jacket.
     looking more eighties than nineties, more cute than cool.
     she walks with tentative, jittery purpose down this
     poverty stricken street. doesn't meet anyone's eye. but
     can feel the eyes on her. she keeps going. she's walked
     too far to turn back.
