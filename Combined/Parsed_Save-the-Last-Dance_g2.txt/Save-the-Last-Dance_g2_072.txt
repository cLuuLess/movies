109   ext. o'donnell heights - rooftop - late day                   109

      a low sun over the cityscape of baltimore. push in on
      patrick and sara, two dots that grow larger. he clicks
      on a boom-box resting on the roof's ledge. a hip-hop
      track blasts.

                                 patrick
                   feel the groove. don't let the
                   music mess with you.

      he starts to move with the music. sara tries to emulate
      him. they dance throughout the conversation.

                                 sara
                   did you always want to be a
                   doctor?

                                 patrick
                   who said i wanna be a doctor?

                                  sara
                   chenille.   everybody.

      he cinches her waist, pushes in her ass.

                                                     (continued)

                                                                         62.

109   continued:                                                               109

                                    patrick
                   keep it tight.     watch your butt.

                                 sara
                   what kind of doctor do you want to
                   be?

                                 patrick
                   pediatrics. i like kids.         come
                   on, stay with me. you're
                   slackin'.

                                 sara
                   do you have any? kids.

                                    patrick
                   no.   do you?

                                 sara
                   i wasn't being smart, patrick.

                                 patrick
                   wouldn't be the first time.

      she stops.     regards him.      he stops.    regards her.
      stalemate.

                                     sara
                   screw you.      i'm brilliant.

      he goes into a spin, a half-split, comes out of it
      swaggering and half-stepping around her. sara gives him
      an impish look. rises up on full pointe, turns out her
      legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his
      head. it happens in two blinks. so fast patrick thinks
      it was a mirage. he stares at her, dumbfounded. sara
      smiles. the look on his face is worth the pain in her
      joints. she blows some stray hair out of her face, puts
      her hands on her hips. looks appropriately hapless.

                                 sara
                   i didn't get it. that thing you
                   just did. show me again?

                                 patrick
                   what was that shit you just did?

      he mimes the move -- badly.        sara can't help it.       she
      laughs.

                                   sara
                   a releve.    over ice.     with a
                   twist.
                                    (more)

                                                           (continued)

                                                                   63.

109   continued:                                                         109

                                 sara (cont'd)
                          (succumbs to his
                           bewilderment)
                   ballet. i used to dance, patrick.

                                 patrick
                   you used to dance?

                             sara
                uh-huh. used to as in don't any
                more. and don't ask me why.

      she sounds suddenly defensive.       patrick's suddenly
      intrigued.

                                patrick
                why not?

                              sara
                because i don't want to talk about
                it.

                              patrick
                that's why you brought it up. did
                that whole relieve thing. 'cause
                you don't wanna talk about it?

                              sara
                because it's not a big deal.       can
                we just concentrate on this?

                              patrick
                yeah, we can concentrate.
                       (a beat; goading her
                        a little)
                but i think it is a big deal.
                whatever it is you don't wanna
                talk about.

      sara shakes her head adamantly. he nods his head
      emphatically. another stalemate. they dance coyly,
      seductively around it.
