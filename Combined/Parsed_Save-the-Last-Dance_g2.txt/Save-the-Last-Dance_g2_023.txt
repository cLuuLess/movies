34   int. sara's room/bathroom - late that night                    34

     sara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip
     quivering. she slips out of bed, creeps on tiptoes into
     the bathroom. closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her.
     she flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on
     both faucets. as the water flows and the pipes rattle,
     the brick wall shatters. sara crumbles to the floor.
     buries her head in her arms. cries like a baby.
