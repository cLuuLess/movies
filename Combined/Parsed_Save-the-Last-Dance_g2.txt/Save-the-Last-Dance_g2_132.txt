      night

      pince-nez leads sara to the stage.      announces her.

      sara walks onstage.

      she nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience.
      her eyes anxiously search for patrick... hoping. her
      music begins.

      grieg's peer gynt (morning). sara starts to sway, moving
      like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. her
      line, proportion and balance are impeccable.

                                                       (continued)

                                                            115.

      tchaikovsky's swan lake (tanz der schwane) begins and
      sara slowly blossoms, opening herself up to the music
      like a flower. she completes every turn and twist and
      leap with confidence, energy and persuasion. she is
      doing what a dancer should do -- engaging the audience,
      igniting their imagination, drawing them in.


      angle - judges

      perking up, taking notes, attentive to her.


      sara

      finishes with a flawless arabesque.      looks out.


      reverse angle - judges

      one of the more imperious-appearing judges removes his
      glasses, speaks to her. sara's still trying to catch her
      breath.

                              stern judge
                you prepared a free-form?

                              sara
                yes... sir... they have... my
                music.

                              judge
                does it have a theme?

                              sara
                yes.  emo...
                       (clears her throat)
                emotion.

      the judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see:

                                 stern judge
                   cue johnson's music.

      music up: a remix of hip-hop (e.g., lauryn's hill's doo
      wop; nas's "we will survive" and jay z's latest) and
      snatches of classical.


      sara

      stands there. doesn't move. can't. she finally walks
      up to the edge of the stage. looks down at the judges,
      her eyes filled with trepidation. her voice is a shaky
      whisper.
                                                (continued)

                                                                   116.

176   continued:                                                          176

                                 sara
                   i'm sorry. i wasn't ready.       can
                   you start it over again?


      reverse angle

      the judge waving off the music.      it stops.      he regards
      sara impatiently.

                                 stern judge
                   are you ready now?

      before she can respond, patrick's voice booms from the
      back of the auditorium.

                                   patrick (o.s.)
                   yes, sir.    she's ready.

      angle widens to reveal him coming forward. rushing for
      the stage. he pauses at the apron of it. looks up at
      sara. she peers down at him, astounded. shaken. he
      smiles at her. she smiles back. patrick's eyes softly
      take her in.

                                  patrick
                   you can do it.
                          (because)
                   ain't nobody watchin' you but me.

      sara's eyes focus on him.       she nods.     turns to the
      judges.

                                   sara
                   i'm ready.

      as her music cues up, patrick slowly backs away from the
      stage.

      sara begins to dance.

      she starts out strong and gets stronger. every emotion
      she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a
      way that we've never seen before, not even when she was
      practicing with patrick. her body has finally found a
      way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its
      meaning and transform her dance.

      the music ends.     the lights go up.

      sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless,
      sweating. she lifts her head slowly and the angle widens
      to reveal --

                                                          (continued)

                                                                 117.

176   continued:                                                        176

      patrick letting out a giant whoop...

      the judges react and the audience gasps...

      ... as he bounds onto the stage and...

      roy jumps to his feet.      proudly and loudly clapping.
      just like glynn.

      angle - sara

      overwhelmed beyond belief. patrick's coming toward her.
      she flies into his arms, free and happy, overjoyed. but
      the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the
      moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer,
      which is her love for patrick.


      judges

      struggling to maintain their and the proceeding's
      decorum, since the audience, caught up in the throes of
      this excitement, has begun to loudly, enthusiastically
      react.

                                 stern judge
                   ladies and gentlemen, please!
                          (to patrick)
                   young man! get off the stage.

      wider to reveal the room.

      patrick hugging sara, looks down at the judges.

                              patrick
                all due respect, if ya'll don't
                let this girl in, you're crazy!

      sara pulls patrick back. walks alone to the edge of the
      stage, composed and professional again. she regards the
      judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy,
      then simply says:

                                  sara
                   thank you.   very much.

                                  stern judge
                   ms. johnson!

      sara stops.    turns back to him.      the judge smiles.

                                 stern judge
                   i can't say this on the record --
                   yet. but welcome to juilliard.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               118.

176   continued:                                                      176

      sara's face

      lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek-to-cheek
      smile. wider as she walks slowly, deliberately back to
      patrick. stops. looks at him. just looks. and then
      she throws her arms around his neck, kissing and hugging
      him. emotional. patrick swings her into the air, twirls
      her around and around, as we:

                                                   dissolve to:
