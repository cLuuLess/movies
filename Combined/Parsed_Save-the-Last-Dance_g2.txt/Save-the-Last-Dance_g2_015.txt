     a torrential rain. a flower van -- glynn's van -- caught
     in it. shooting through the driver's side window, we can
     see glynn's face, intense and determined, squinting
     through the downpour.

     the squeal of its brakes as glynn loses control and
     smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of
     her.
