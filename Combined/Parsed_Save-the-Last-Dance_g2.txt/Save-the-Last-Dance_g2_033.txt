56   int./ext. roy's truck - continuous action                     56

     sara climbs in, slams the door. roy looks over at her,
     unaware of how annoyed she is with him. she's a clenched
     fist inside.

                                 roy
                  how'd it go?

                                 sara
                  fine.
                      (as he pulls off)
