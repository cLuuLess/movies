123   int. sara's room - night                                    123

      camera pans the room, picking up small touches from
      sara's past life, her previous bedroom -- more on display
      than we've seen before. hold on closet door. a beat
      before sara emerges from behind it, ballet slippers in
      hand. she takes a deep breath. slides them on. peers
      down at her feet. wiggles them. nothing magical or
      mystical but simply wonderful. gleefully wonderful.
      like the end of a long day's journey to home.

                                                               76.
