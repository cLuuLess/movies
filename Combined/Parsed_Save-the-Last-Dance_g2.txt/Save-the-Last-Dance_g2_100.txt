      sara takes her defensive position against an opposing
      player, successfully blocks the shot, tries to slam the
      ball to nikki. it clips nikki's head, bounces out of
      bounds. nikki, her dignity stunned, her patience out,
      walks up to sara, shoves her to the floor. sara looks up
      at her as some disembodied voice calls out:

                              female voice
                don't start nothin', won't be
                nothin'! stay down, girl!
