59   int. roy's apartment - kitchen - close on empty t.v.         59
     dinner tray - night

     an empty beer bottle, one askew kitchen chair. vestiges
     of roy's meal. angle widens as sara enters. she opens
     the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche
     of falling food. a box of sugar puffs cereal lands at
     her feet. something else out of place. she picks it up,
     jams everything back into the freezer. slams the door
     shut.

                                                shock cut to:


60   sara                                                         60

     in a whirlwind, cleaning the apartment. wall to wall.
     scrubbing away what's churned up inside. the dervish
     ends in her "room," where she finishes unpacking.
     several layers into a suitcase, she comes to her ballet
     shoes. the sight hits her like a slap in the face. sara
     stares at the shoes until her eyes blur. then she
     snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet.
