72   ext./int. reynolds apartment/hallway - night                72

     chenille triple unlocks the door, lets sara in. sara's
     surprised -- the apartment is surprisingly quaint and
     extremely neat. it looks a helluva lot better than roy's
     place. chenille is dressed in hugely baggy military-
     style pants and a tube top with a form-fitting, short-cut
     leather coat over it. sara takes it in.

                              sara
               cool outfit.

                              chenille
               slammin'.   slammin' outfit.

                             sara
               ... i look okay?

     chenille gives her the once over.   decides to lie.

                             chenille
               yeah.  you look okay.
                      (then)
               moma dean. i'm leavin'.


     from another angle

     grandmomma dean enters with a toddler ("christopher") in
     her arms. she sports snow white, waist-length dreads and
     she's wearing a dashiki lounger. despite her white
     locks, she doesn't look old enough to be a grandmother.
     she hands christopher to chenille. inspects sara. her
     eyes are open, kind.

                             chenille
                      (fussing over
                       christopher)
               grandmom, sara. sara, grandmom.
               also known as momma dean. and
               handsome here is christopher.

                              sara
               hi.

                             momma dean
               hello. now don't get him all
               riled up, chenille. i want to get
               some sleep tonight.

     chenille kisses christopher, hands him off to momma dean.
     they exit. sara looks tentatively at chenille.

                             sara
               is that... is he... yours?

                             chenille
               he sure ain't momma dean's.

                                                           36.
