74   ext. 6th and broadway (east baltimore) - night              74

     a curbed cab. sara and chenille get out. chenille digs
     into her pocketbook, hands sara her i.d. push in on
     photo of obese white girl with an untamed trailer trash
     perm. sara's eyes go wide.

                              sara
               chenille.   she's ugly.   she's fat!

                            chenille
              she's twenty-one too. i ain't got
              all night. let's hop.

                            sara
              wait. i have to ask you
              something.
                     (hard for her)
              do i really look alright?

     an unspoken thing passes between them. chenille suddenly
     whips off her coat. gestures at sara with her head.

                             chenille
               gimme that '89 madonna shit.    your
               jacket. give it here.

     sara takes off the bolero. chenille ties it around her
     own neck, then yanks sara's miniskirt down around her
     hips. sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee.
     chenille frowns at it.

                             sara
               it's from the gap.

                             chenille
               it's country. you look country in
               it. take it off.

                             sara
               i'm not walking in there in my
               bra.

                                                  (continued)

                                                           37.

74   continued:                                                  74

     chenille thrusts her leather coat at her. sara can't
     believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public
     street! she pulls off the tee, slips on chenille's coat.
     buttons it as far as the buttons go. looks down. half
     her chest is exposed.
