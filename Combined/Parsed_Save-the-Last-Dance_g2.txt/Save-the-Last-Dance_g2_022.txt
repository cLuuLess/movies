33   int. roy's apartment - living area - minutes later            33

     sara walks in.   doesn't see roy.   calls out.

                             sara
               do you have a phone?

     roy emerges from the bathroom drying his hands, walks
     past her.

                             roy
               of course i have a phone.

                             sara
               you didn't at the last place.    the
               last place i saw anyway.

                             roy
               things change. you've changed.
               you grew up on me. overnight.

                                                  (continued)

                                                              12.

                                sara
                  over the summer. you blew me off
                  for some gig on the road,
                  remember?
                         (before he can
                          respond)
                  can i call lindsay? let her know
                  i got here alright.

                            roy
              are you alright, sara?
                     (off the scowl
                      in her eyes)
              i just wanna know how you feel.

                               sara
              i feel fine.     i feel like calling
              lindsay.

     she's a wall. a brick wall. roy's head aches from
     knocking into it. he goes to the couch. drops down.
     mutters at her.

                                roy
                  phone's in the kitchen.   knock
                  yourself out.
