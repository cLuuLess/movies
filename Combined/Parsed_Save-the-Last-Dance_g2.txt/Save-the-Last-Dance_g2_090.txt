134   int. feetz - dance floor                                         134

      sara and patrick, still going at it. snookie, diggy and
      others prance around them like backup dancers.


      another angle - nikki

      standing with her crew dourly observing patrick and sara.

                                nikki
                  watch me squash their shit.    hard.


      on nikki

      shoving, pushing, and barging her way up to patrick.
      without preamble or regard for sara, she starts dancing
      with him. patrick looks at sara but he's somehow dancing
      with nikki. sara retreats with daggers in her eyes.
      pissed.


      patrick (and nikki)

      unresponsive as she grinds her body into his, raw and
      wild.


      sara

      standing where she can see but can't be seen from the
      dance floor. from a curtain of kids, malakai suddenly
      appears at her side. sara can't move. she's boxed in.
      malakai indicates nikki and patrick with slick
      satisfaction, whispers derisively:

                                                     (continued)

                                                                81.

134   continued:                                                      134

                                  malakai
                   you ain't never gonna look as good
                   as she does with him. that's oil.
                   you're milk. ain't no point in
                   tryin' to mix.

      he evaporates into the crowd.        sara stands there.


      patrick and nikki

      as a slow dance begins. nikki starts to press herself
      against patrick. patrick holds her off with both arms.
      walks away.


      wider angle - dance floor - favor patrick

      moving toward sara.

      a stark, apologetic expression on his face. he takes her
      hand. sara fiercely jerks away. patrick grabs her hand
      again, more emphatically this time. but sara won't budge
      from the spot where she's standing. so patrick slides
      his arms around her, holds her without moving. they
      remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly
      begin to dance. we push in on them in this little space.
      patrick's lips brush sara's ear.

                                 patrick
                   sara...?

                                 sara
                   what?

                                 patrick
                i'm sorry.


      angle past them on malakai

      slow dancing with his flavor of the night. eyes on sara
      and patrick. both underwhelmed and resentful of what he
      sees.
