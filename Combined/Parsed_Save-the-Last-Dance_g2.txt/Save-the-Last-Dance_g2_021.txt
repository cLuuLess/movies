32   int. roy's apartment - night                                  32

     the second floor of a two-story house has been turned
     into a one-bedroom studio. a partition separates the
     living area from the bedroom. sara walks past a
     collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of
     herself. aside from the saxophones and the pictures,
     there's hardly any furniture. roy lights a cigarette.

                             roy
               not much of what you're used to.
               but the water's hot and the fridge
               is full. and i made room in the
               closets for you. girl's gotta
               have closets, right? you even get
               your own bed. i'll crash on the
               couch.

                             sara
               you bought a bed?

                             roy
                      (slight bow)
               pardon me. your own futon.     check
               it out. on the other side.

     suitcase in hand, sara walks around the partition. her
     "room" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. she
     stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do.
     she removes framed photos of glynn from her backpack,
     places them around the room.
