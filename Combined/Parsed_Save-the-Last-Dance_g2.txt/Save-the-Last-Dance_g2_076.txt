114   ext. inner harbor (downtown baltimore) - park - day              114

      a perfect day. camera pans from the waterfront to the
      bustling crowds of the inner harbor, then to a park
      across from this where sara and patrick are practicing.
      hip-hop music softly plays from patrick's boom-box. sara
      watches his face as they dance.

                                 patrick
                   didn't you like it when you 'used'
                   to dance?

                                                       (continued)

                                                                67.

                                 sara
                   yeah i liked it. i was gonna go
                   to juilliard. that school fucked
                   up my entire life. it's a long
                   story.

                                  patrick
                   let me guess. you don't wanna
                   talk about it.

      sara looks at him.     a soft smile is all she offers up.
