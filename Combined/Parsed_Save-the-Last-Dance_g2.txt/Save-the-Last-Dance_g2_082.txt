      sara and patrick watch the boston company perform igor
      stravinsky's "scenes de ballet" as choreographed by
      christopher wheeldon. they're both enraptured. but
      while patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of sara,
      her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. she is
      utterly, totally engaged and amazed. the yearning that
      never really left her returns to tug at her heart and
      project her soul onto the stage.
