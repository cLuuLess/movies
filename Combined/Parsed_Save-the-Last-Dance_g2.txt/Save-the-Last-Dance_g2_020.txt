31   ext. bond street (south baltimore) - night                  31

     roy's truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses
     with pristine white marble steps. he and sara each lug a
     suitcase from the truck. her eyes wander up and down the
     street. they're on the fringes of a ghetto. a few
     people roost on their stoops, hang on the corners. all
     of them have black faces.

                                sara
                  thought you were moving to fells
                  point.

                                  roy
                  fell through.

                                                             11.
