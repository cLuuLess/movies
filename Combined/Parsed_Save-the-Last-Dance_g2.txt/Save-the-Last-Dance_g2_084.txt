122   ext. roy's apartment/street - that night                    122

      patrick walks sara to the front door. they pause on the
      stoop. neither of them wants the night to end.

                                 sara
                   see you tomorrow?

      a rhetorical question under the circumstances. patrick
      regards her tenderly, moves her hair from her eyes.
      stares deeply into them. sara smiles wanly, certain she
      looks like shit. but it doesn't matter. the moment has
      named itself. and so, with more certainty than passion,
      they kiss.
