151   int. roy's apartment - living area/sara's room - day           151

      roy's tuning his sax when sara enters. her face is a
      mess. yet she drifts by, bruised and bent over, as if
      this were the norm. roy does a double-take.

                              roy
                what the hell happened to you?

                              sara
                i got suspended. two days.

      she straggles into her room.    roy follows her to the
      futon.

                              roy
                for what? fighting?
                       (as she nods
                        like "no shit
                        sherlock")
                why were you fighting, sara?

                              sara
                       (sardonically)
                i'm not sure. i think it's some
                kind of black female thing.

      he sis down beside her, instinctively reaches out to
      touch her face, assess the damage. sara sharply flinches
      away. but roy persists and after a moment, she lets him
      minister to her.
