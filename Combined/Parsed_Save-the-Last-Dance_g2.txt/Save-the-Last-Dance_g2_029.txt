43   int. jurasinski's classroom - morning                           43

     the room's seen better days. probably better teachers
     too. mr. jurasinski looks out at his american literature
     class and sees nothing but tenure.

                                                     (continued)

                                                                17.

                                   jurasinski
                  in cold blood    represents a turning
                  point in our    country's literature.
                  take the cap    off and tell me why
                  that is, mr.    ricard.

     wider to include the class. favor "snookie" ricard. we
     recognize him from the hallway kids wrapped up in
     patrick. snookie, a flagrant patrick wannabe, sits next
     to him now. he removes his baseball cap. thoughtfully
     twirls it on a finger. he truly believes he's being
     profound.

                                 snookie
                  gay rights. that compote dude who
                  wrote it? sweet tooth. straight-
                  up fag, mr. j.

                                jurasinski
                  thank you, mr. ricard. your
                  genius grant is in the mail.
                  anyone else?

     no volunteers. jurasinski looks for someone to put on
     the spot. sees the new girl in a back corner. johnson.
     he gets into her line of sight. the class shifts in
     their seats, peeping her.

                                jurasinski
                  ms... johnson. you can catch up
                  later. if this is over your head.

     everyone looks at her.        the way kids look at new kids.

                                sara
                  it's a non-fiction novel. the
                  first of its kind. capote mixed
                  true events with things he
                  couldn't know, so he made them up.

     a small murmur goes up.        over this, the voice of a
     dissenter.

                                patrick (o.s.)
                  white folks back then felt safe.
                  capote scared 'em. he took hard
                  core crime out the ghetto and
                  dropped it in america's back yard.
                  that's what makes the book
                  special.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                    18.

     sara cranes to see him. god. it's pretty-boy. he's
     sitting on the other side of the classroom. looking...
     pretty. looking at her. he has nice eyes. not that she
     noticed.

                                 sara
                  yeah.   that is part of it.

                             patrick
               that's all of it. capote wasn't
               first. richard wright and james
               baldwin did the same thing.
               wasn't nobody tryin' to read them
               though.

                                sara
                  lots of people read them.

     a defensive save.      patrick sees right through it.

                                patrick
                  lots of people like who?      you?
                  hello. didn't think so.

                                snookie
                  mr. j.! girl needs to bone up.
                  give her a pass to the lib'ary.

     the room erupts in laughter.


     on sara

     flushed in the face.      embarrassed.     pissed.

     angle widens as jurasinski quiets the class.           then.

                                jurasinski
                  she can have your pass, mr.
                  ricard. since you obviously never
                  use it.
