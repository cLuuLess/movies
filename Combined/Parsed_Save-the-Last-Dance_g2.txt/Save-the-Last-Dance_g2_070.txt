98   int. reynolds' apartment - living room/kitchen -                98
     late that night

     patrick, still in work coveralls, enters. first thing he
     does is pick up a stack of mail. tracking him into
     kitchen as he crosses to refrigerator, takes out a plate
     momma dean's left for him. he sits down at the table,
     takes a breath, begins shifting through the mail. his
     face registers disappointment. nothing. again.
