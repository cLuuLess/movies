61   ext. o'donnell heights public housing projects -             61
     morning

     patrick, chenille, snookie straggle through the dreary
     jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the
     way to school. it's quiet now but the scars of past
     battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of
     its corners, are evident everywhere.

                             snookie
               i need a date --

                              chenille
               why?   your hand busy?

                             snookie
               -- for the prom. and if it wasn't
               for that kinda undue attitude, you
               could be the lucky girl, chenille.
               my personal prom queen. i can see
               us now.

                                                (continued)

                                                              28.

61   continued:                                                     61

                                chenille
                  you must be lookin' in your
                  dreams.

     snookie glances at patrick.       he's somewhere else.

                                  snookie
                  help me, man.    defend me.

                                patrick
                  i got my own problems, snook.

                             snookie
               what problems? you goin' to
               college. doctor college after
               that. you large, man.

                             patrick
               i ain't gonna be doctor nothin' if
               i don't get in and i'm not in 'til
               i get my letter.

                             chenille
               it's in the mail, patrick.       okay?

                             snookie
                      (wishfully thinking)
               i probably coulda been a doctor
               too. if i hadn't got left back
               that time.

                             chenille
               that time? what? fifth and sixth
               grade don't count?

     patrick finally laughs. then his face changes. becomes
     serious. he hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them.
     they continue on like this, the ruins of their world in
     the b.g. behind them.
