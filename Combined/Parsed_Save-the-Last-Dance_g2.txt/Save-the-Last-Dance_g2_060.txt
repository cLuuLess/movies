     walking.   sara keeps stealing glances of him.   or so she
     thinks.

                               patrick
                what?

                               sara
                        (caught)
                what?

                                                  (continued)

                                                               48.

                                patrick
                  why you keep lookin' at me?

                                sara
                  i have to look somewhere. the
                  streets are deserted. might as
                  well look at you.

                                patrick
                  that's not why. you wanna know
                  somethin'. ask somethin'.

                             sara
               it's not a question. it's the way
               you were beating that kid up. you
               looked so mad.

                                patrick
                  i was mad and he wasn't no kid.
                  but you're from the suburb mars,
                  right? folks don't fight there.

                                 sara
                  not like that.
                         (some kind of
                          wonder)
                  you were really kicking his ass.

     it's not funny, the look on her face.      but patrick
     laughs.

                             sara
               are you laughing at me?

     dropping the smile, patrick shakes his head.      looks at
     her.

                             patrick
               my friend was in trouble.

                             sara
               maybe he's my question. your
               friend. chenille doesn't like
               him.

                                patrick
                  she likes him. it don't stop her
                  from trippin' off him now and
                  then. but malakai's good people.
                  we go back. way back. you know,
                  like they say, through thick and
                  thin.
                         (beat)
                  so, how'd you like feetz?

                                                     (continued)

                                                                49.

                                   sara
                  it was great.

                                patrick
                  once you got used to the music.

                                sara
                  it wasn't the music i wasn't used
                  to. i mean, it's not the first
                  time i heard hip-hop, patrick.

                               patrick
                  uh-huh. bet you listen to it all
                  the time.

     patrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile. his stare
     is significant, unsettling. sara's face flushes. she
     turns from him, hoping he didn't see it.

                                sara
                  not all the time. but a lot.

                                patrick
                  we gettin' any closer to your crib
                  or should we stop for food and
                  water?

     sara snaps out of it. looks around. shit. first the
     flush and now this. she looks at him. she could kick
     herself.

                                   sara
                  we passed it.

                                   patrick
                  you passed it.

     a look. they double back to her front door.        pause on
     the stoop.

                            sara
              thanks for walking me.

                                   patrick
              no problem.

                                sara
              so.      i'll see ya.

                            patrick
              is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz,
              had a great time, can't wait to
              see you again?
                             (more)

                                                      (continued)

                                                               50.

                                patrick (cont'd)
                  or is it like 'see ya,' i'll bust
                  a cap in your ass if you ever
                  darken my doorstep again?

     he makes it impossible not to smile.     so damned charming.

                                sara
                  i haven't said gee-whiz since i
                  was six. but i really had a great
                  time... okay?

                                patrick
                  okay.

     she enters the rowhouse. patrick waits until the lights
     go on inside before he turns around and starts home.
