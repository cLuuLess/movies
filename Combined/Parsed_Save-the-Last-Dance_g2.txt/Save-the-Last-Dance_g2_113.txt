      patrick and malakai nurse drinks. the music fails to
      move them. they have too much on their minds. malakai
      fires up a cigarette.

                                 malakai
                   so what you gonna do?

                                 patrick
                   how many times you gonna ask me
                   that?

                                 malakai
                   it's payback time. either you
                   down or you ain't. either you
                   m'boy or you not. simple as that.

      patrick takes a long moment. the choice is simple. it's
      the decision that's complicated. he downs his drink.
      hedges.

                                 patrick
                   even if i did ride, you ain't got
                   nobody but lip and lip will get a
                   nigger's ass killed. quick.

                             malakai
               eastside ain't got no firepower.
               i got some shit, man. ak-47. we
               go in, get out with one spray
               down.

      just then snookie and sara walk toward them from the
      dance floor. something in their faces unsettles sara but
      snookie, oblivious, dances up to the bar, snapping his
      fingers and bobbing his head.

                             snookie
               you see us, patrick?

                                                     (continued)

                                                          101.

157   continued:                                                 157

                                 malakai
                          (a storm warning)
                   you see us, man? we're rappin'.

      snookie rebuffs him, keeps talking to patrick...

                              snookie
                me and sara lit it up!      y-e-o-w!

      ... bumps his butt against sarah's hip, does a very
      ungainly half split. sara and patrick exchange smiles.
      malakai isn't amused. he flattens snookie's ass with the
      business end of his foot. snookie sprawls flat on his
      face to the floor. now malakai's amused. sara looks at
      patrick. patrick scowls at malakai.

                                 patrick
                   that shit ain't funny.

                                 snookie
                          (springing up)
                   damn right it ain't funny.

                                 malakai
                   i thought you liked it down there.
                   that's your specialty, ain't it?
                   crawling?

                              snookie
                that was a reflex action, man.
                and you just plain rude and wrong
                to bring the shit up in mixed
                company.

      sara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she
      doesn't want the displeasure of malakai's company. she
      taps patrick.

                              sara
                i gotta get home. ready?

      malakai's eyes slice into her. first snookie, now this
      bitch. steppin' all over his conversation with patrick.

                             malakai
               no, he ain't ready. he's talkin'.
               to me. a-b conversation. gotta
               go? c yourself the fuck home.

                              sara
                       (a real reflex action)
                fuck you.

      malakai lunges for her. the move is so swift and sudden
      patrick overturns his stool to dive between them. he
      sweeps sara behind him, into the path of a startled

      snookie. stands there nose-to-nose with malakai, staring
      him down, furious with him.

                              patrick
                have you lost your motherfuckin'
                mind, man? huh? have you!

      sara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do.
      snookie's voice weakly creaks out. he's trying to rise
      to the occasion.

                             snookie
               patrick, man, c'mon.

      but malakai and patrick stay where they stand. too close
      for comfort. both in the danger zone. malakai regards
      patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep,
      genuine hurt.

                             malakai
               you take that bitch's back and
               won't even cover mine?

                             patrick
               'cause you wrong, malakai!

                             malakai
               no! you wrong. you been wrong.
               you ain't worth shit no more.
                      (venomously)
               get out my face, and take that ho
               with you.

      patrick bucks up. sara walks over to him, gently
      clutches his sleeve. it's no easier to turn away from
      malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of
      friendship. but patrick does. with sara holding onto
      his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away.
