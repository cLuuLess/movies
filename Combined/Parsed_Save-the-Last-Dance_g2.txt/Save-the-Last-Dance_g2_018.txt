29   ext. amtrak train - same time                               29

     a conductor helps sara to the platform. steam from the
     train's engine is sucked into the fog. she walks through
     it. sees him. they see each other. roy weakly waves.
     walks toward her. sara watches his bow legs stiffly
     advance. she wants to run. can't.

                                 roy
                hi.

                                 sara
                hi.

                              roy
                have a good ride?

     sara self-consciously tucks her hair behind an ear.

                              sara
                slept through most of it.

     a beat.   roy looks at her.

                              roy
                guess you got stuff.    baggage.

                                 sara
                two suitcases.     one big one.

                              roy
                looks like they're unloading.
                -- you hungry? we can stop
                somewhere if you want.

                              sara
                i'm kinda tired.

     roy takes her backpack.     they walk.
