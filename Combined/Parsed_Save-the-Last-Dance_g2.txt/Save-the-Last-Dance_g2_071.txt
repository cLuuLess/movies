     patrick sits across from mrs. gwynn, the reality check of
     patterson high.

                             mrs. gwynn
               maybe you think it's enough to
               have the grades, get a full
               scholarship. but it isn't,
               patrick. georgetown makes mulch
               of students like you every
               semester. you have to be ready to
               change. change friends.
               lifestyle. your entire point of
               view. what i'm saying is, options
               won't matter if you don't keep a
               clean nose to the grindstone.

                       the eye)
               i know that, mrs. gwynn.

     the unflappable patrick.    he doesn't fool mrs. gwynn.

                   knowing's easy. doing is hard.

                i know you're -- how do you put
                it? -- large here, nikki. you
                enjoy that and it's fine for now.
                i guess. but you can't live your
                life like a popularity contest.

      walking in.     sitting down.

                                 sara
                   i don't think it's realistic, what
                   you're asking. things happen.
                   things change. and the changes
                   change you. what's the point of
                   plans?

                                 mrs. gwynn
                   to have a sense of direction.

                                 sara
                   you can't direct destiny.

                          (fingering sara's
                           papers)
                   i see here that you trained for
                   juilliard, that you auditioned.

                             sara
               that was a long time ago.

                             mrs. gwynn
               it was three months ago, sara.
                      (the brick wall)
               well, if you're not going to
               pursue dance, what are you going
               to do?

                                 sara
                          (hadn't thought about
                           it)
                   i don't know. take a year off.
                   work. go to college later on.

                                 mrs. gwynn
                   be careful with later on, sara.
                   it's a slippery slope. sometimes
                   you can run right on top of it and
                   it never catches up with you.
