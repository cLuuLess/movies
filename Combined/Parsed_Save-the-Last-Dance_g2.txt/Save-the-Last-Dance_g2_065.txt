90   int. patterson high - hallway - morning                          90

     a fight. two black girls having at it. it's a ferocious
     match. hair pulling, spit flying, punches landed,
     clothes torn apart.


     angle on sara

     as she crowns the corner, comes to a bottleneck of
     students. it's like the nose bleed section of caesar's
     palace. the far hallway is the ring. sara cranes her
     neck to see the action.
                                                (continued)

                                                            54.

90   continued:                                                   90

     angle widens as a security guard earns his hazard pay.
     he separates the two girls who are still swinging at each
     other. he throws one into a corner, hurls the other in
     an opposite corner.


     on sara

     as a white girl standing next to her shakes her head
     lamentably.

                                   sara
                  what happened?

     the white girl studies sara's suburban clothes and fresh-
     scrubbed face. thinks she found a kindred spirit.

                                tony (white girl)
                  we freed the slaves and didn't
                  teach them no manners.
                         (before sara can react)
                  you're sara, right?
                         (as sara warily nods)
                  toni. i was gonna introduce
                  myself before but you're always
                  with that crowd. you know.
                  chenille, her girls, that identity
                  crisis diggy.

     sara looks at toni. getting it. getting her. the
     expression on her face closes off. toni, too dense to
     read it, keeps talking.

                                toni
                         (brightly)
                  we should hang out sometime, sara.
                  the two of us. whenever you
                  decide to lose the tan?

     her inference clear, toni flashes a brilliant smile,
     happily walks off. sara shakes her head to herself.
     what an idiot.

     as sara continues down the hall, a p.a. address comes on.

                                p.a. address (v.o.)
                  seniors, a reminder before you
                  rise up and change the world.
                  mrs. gwynn is holding all diplomas
                  hostage in her office. her only
                  demand is the pleasure of your
                  company for career d-day. be
                  there.

     sara enters her classroom, a bunch of kids in front of
     and behind her.

                                                               55.
