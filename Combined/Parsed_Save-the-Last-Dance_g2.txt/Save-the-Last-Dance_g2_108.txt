      patrick walks in, arvel's dried blood stained into his
      clothes. chenille's cooking with a sound-asleep
      christopher slung over her shoulder. she and patrick
      regard each other morosely.

                               chenille
                how's arvel?

      patrick slumps down at the kitchen table.     he's barely
      audible.

                              patrick
                pretty bad.
                       (almost to himself)
                can't even play a got-damned game
                of ball no more.

      chenille comes up behind him.    squeezes, pats his
      shoulder.

                                                    (continued)

                                                               94.

                                 chenille
                   you see sara? she alright?
                          (as he looks up
                           with a question
                           mark)
                   you didn't hear? nikki jumped off
                   at her in gym. it was fierce...

      given the day, this is the straw on patrick's back. he
      bolts from the table and on his way out nearly bumps
      heads with kenny.
