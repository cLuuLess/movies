39   int. administration building - morning                       39

     through a window, sara seated across from an
     administrator. we push in.

                             administrator
               ... it's no fun being uprooted in
               the middle of your senior year.
               we realize that and we'll do what
               we can to help with the
               transition.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                 15.

39   continued:                                                        39

     there's a knock at door. mrs. gwynn, the guidance
     counselor, steps in. the administrator introduces her to
     sara. sara regards mrs. gwynn with polite petulance.

                                   mrs. gwynn
                  any questions?     concerns?

                                   sara
                  about school?     no.   not really.

                                mrs. gwynn
                  not even about baltimore?

                                sara
                  i'm not gonna be here that long.
                  besides, it's just a city, right?

     mrs. gwynn looks at her squarely. but the brick wall
     doesn't move an inch. sara feels too safe behind it.
