165   int. sara's room - night                                      165

      sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album.
      pictures of her and glynn. roy knocks on the partition.
      waits a beat before he comes in. he looks at sara. she
      keeps flipping.

                              roy
                i was wondering... how long you
                plan on hating me? maybe i'm an
                optimist but i hope there's some
                kind of timetable.
                       (this raises a
                        small smile)
                well, i don't wanna bug you. i
                just came in to say good luck.

      sara regards him quizzically. roy goes to her dresser,
      picks up an envelope from juilliard.

                              roy
                i saw the return address. got
                curious. it was open. i read it.
                i know i shouldn't have but at
                least now i have an excuse to tell
                you how proud i am of you, sara.

                              sara
                       (quietly miserable)
                i was gonna tell you about the
                audition, roy. i meant to.

      she's clutching the photo album.    roy sits down next to
      her.

                              roy
                tomorrow's the big day?

                               sara
                uh-huh.   the big day.

                               roy
                you bummed out about it?
                        (as she shakes
                         her head)
                you're a worse liar than i am
                father.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                   108.

165   continued:                                                          165

                                 sara
                   you're not so bad.
                          (close to a
                           confession)
                   i didn't give you much to work
                   with. it's not like i've been the
                   perfect daughter.

                              roy
                well, it ain't like i deserve a
                perfect daughter. i screwed up.
                did everything in a hurry and
                still thought i had all the time
                in the world. to be in love with
                your mother. be a father to you.
                but time flies. you look up one
                day and all you got to show for
                yourself is a pretty little girl
                who hates your guts and won't talk
                to you because too much time went
                by.

      sara's eyes well up.    before she can stop herself,        she's
      crying.

                              sara
                i don't hate you. i miss her. i
                miss mom...
                       (as roy takes her
                        in his arms, tries
                        to console her)
                ... patrick's pissed at me. i'm
                pissed at him. he's not coming
                tomorrow and i want him there and
                i don't know what to do.

      sara draws back from roy, wipes her tears.       collects
      herself.

                              roy
                you want him there. i understand
                that. but whatever he brings to
                the table, patrick can't dance for
                you, sara. you're the bottom line
                out there. this is your chance to
                be the dancer juilliard came to
                see.

                              sara
                i wanted somebody there who loves
                me.

      roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony
      implicit.

                                                    (continued)

                                                              109.

165   continued:                                                     165

                                 roy
                   i love you.

      sara looks up.    for the first time in her life, she
      believes him.
