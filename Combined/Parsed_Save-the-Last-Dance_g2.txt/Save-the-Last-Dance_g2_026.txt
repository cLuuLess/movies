38   ext./int. patterson high - morning                           38

     sara moving toward us past a floating mosaic of black
     faces. this is a near out-of-body experience for her.
     she walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff
     straight line to the school's entrance. it's clogged
     with students. inside the doorway, two security guards
     flank a metal detector. when it's sara's turn to pass
     through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and
     wordlessly begins searching it. he hands it back to her
     on the other side of the detector where sara stands
     obtusely and mutely amazed.
