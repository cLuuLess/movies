64   int. hallway near entrance (patterson high) -                 64
     continuous action

     patrick and chenille pass through metal detectors, watch
     snookie clown his way through. the security guard shakes
     his head. all three begin to walk. snookie, bobbing and
     jiving, doesn't see mrs. gwynn coming up from behind.
     her voice stops him cold.

                             mrs. gwynn
                      (as patrick and
                       chenille look on)
               light on your feet? good. be
               sure they dance into my office
               next week.

     she moseys on.   snookie regards patrick's smile, shakes
     his head.
