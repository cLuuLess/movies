154   int. laundromat (southeast baltimore) - early evening          154

      the laundromat is empty but for a few customers and
      nikki. she's loading clothes from two large baskets into
      washers when her brother diondre, 10, races in. he's
      grinning from ear-to-ear.

                              nikki
                diondre, what your butt doin'
                here?

                              diondre
                       (a taunting twist)
                i can go where i want. you the
                one on punishment.

      nikki swings a wet shirt with no intention of hitting
      him. she looks up. patrick's standing in the doorway.
      diondre runs up to him, holds out the palm of his hand.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               95.

154   continued:                                                     154

                                   diondre
                   there she go.    gimme my two
                   dollars.

      patrick pays him. diondre darts out. patrick walks up
      to nikki. nikki clenches, tries to dismiss him with a
      backhanded wave.

                                 nikki
                   whatever it is, i don't wanna hear
                   it.

      patrick leans up against a washing machine and for a long
      moment just looks at her. the walk there has composed
      his emotions.

                                 patrick
                   i thought you had somethin' to say
                   to me.

                                 nikki
                   you thought wrong.

      an old black woman is avidly, openly watchin' them.
      patrick indicates a bench on the other side of the
      laundromat. nikki petulantly follows him there. they
      sit. patrick looks at her.

                             patrick
               somethin' must be on your mind for
               you to get up in sara's face,
               start all this drama. what you
               tryin' to prove, nikki?

                                 nikki
                   you're the one tryin' to prove
                   something. stuck up in her shit
                   like she's somethin' special.

                                 patrick
                   what if she is? what's it to you?
                   you didn't see me trippin' off
                   that howard dude and i could have.
                   i coulda tripped hard, nikki.

                                 nikki
                   that was different.

                                 patrick
                   how you gonna call it different?

      she stands up.     looks down at him.    raises her voice.

                                                      (continued)

                                                            96.

154   continued:                                                  154

                             nikki
               because she's white and he ain't.
               and don't sit there like you don't
               know what i'm talkin' about,
               patrick.

                             patrick
                      (glaring at her)
               you don't even know what you're
               talkin' about, nikki.

                                    nikki
                   i don't?     y'all black men, soon as
                   you even    think about goin'
                   someplace    good, first thing you do
                   is find a    white girl to take with
                   you.

                                   old woman (o.s.)
                   uh-huh.

      patrick glares in the old woman's direction, then back at
      nikki.

                                 patrick
                   i thought i was goin' someplace
                   good with you. you the one called
                   me off. but you ain't tryin' to
                   remember that. now you mad. why?
                   because she's white and i like
                   her? i'm with her.

                                nikki
                   please. you're with her because
                   she's white. that's what sets me
                   off.

                                 patrick
                          (exasperated)
                   it ain't got no business settin'
                   you off! me and her ain't got
                   nothin' to do with you and what
                   you think. so keep your hands off
                   her and that shit to yourself.

      nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him
      defiantly.

                                 nikki
                   i don't think it, i know it. but
                   you go ahead, deny it. that's
                   what y'all always do.

      she turns on her heels, goes back to her machine.
      patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. he
      holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out.

                                                                97.
