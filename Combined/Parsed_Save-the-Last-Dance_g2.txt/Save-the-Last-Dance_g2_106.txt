150   int. mrs. gwynn's office - sara and nikki - day               150

      in adjacent chairs across from mrs. gwynn's empty one.

                              nikki
                       (a hiss, under her
                        breath)
                it ain't over, bitch.

                             sara
               over? i don't even know why it
               started... bitch. and don't say
               it's about patrick because it's
               not. it's not about him.

                            nikki
               no. it's about you. white girls
               like you. creepin' up, takin' our
               men. the whole world ain't
               enough. you gotta conquer ours
               too.

                              sara
                i like him, he likes me. and if
                you don't like that, screw you.

      mrs. gwynn walks in.   sits down.    looks reproachfully at
      them.

                               mrs. gwynn
                girls.   i think you need to talk.

                                                               93.
