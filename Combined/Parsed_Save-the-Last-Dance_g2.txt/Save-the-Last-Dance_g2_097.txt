      patrick drinks at a water fountain. looks up. malakai's
      standing there. there's still some tension between them.

                                 malakai

                                  patrick
                   druid hill?   hell yeah.

                   anyway. not with those suckers.

                   rings.

      they walk off together and, after a few steps, begin
      dribbling imaginary balls down the hall.
