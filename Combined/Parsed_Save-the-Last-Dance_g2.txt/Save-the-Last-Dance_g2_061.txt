86   int. roy's apartment - kitchen - next morning                    86

     roy's making breakfast when sara straggles in. she peers
     at the stove. scrambled eggs and bacon. toast too! a
     first for him.

                                roy
                  figured i'd put a little marrow in
                  your bones. siddown, siddown.
                         (she slumps in chair)
                  you gettin' along at school?
                  makin' friends...?
                         (as she nods robotically)
                  ... see any of 'em last night?

     he slides a plate in front of her.      stands there holding
     his.

                                roy
                  i came home on my break.

                                sara
                  oh.

     the succinct sneer in her voice gets to roy.       he snaps at
     her.

                            roy
              ... oh? jesus! you're hard!
              look. you're seventeen. if you
              wanna go out, go out. but don't
              lie to me. on top of everything
              else, don't make me worry like
              that about you.
                            (more)

                                                      (continued)

                                                                51.

86   continued:                                                       86

                                roy (cont'd)
                         (after long moment)
                  i didn't mean to yell.
                         (sits down; trying
                          like hell)
                  so how are the eggs? they good?

     sara takes a small, tasteless sample, nods. they eat in
     silence. then sara looks over at him with genuine if
     detached remorse.

                                sara
                  you're right. i should've said
                  something. i'm sorry.

     roy exhales.     finally, a chink in the brick wall.

                                roy
                  what're you gonna do today?
                  anything special?

                                   sara
                  nope.     nothing special.
