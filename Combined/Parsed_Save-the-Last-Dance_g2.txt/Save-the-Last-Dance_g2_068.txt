96   int. sara's room - not much later                            96

     open close on a framed photo of glynn and sara (in full
     ballet costume). embracing. happy. pull back to see
     sara. sitting on the edge of her futon, holding glynn's
     clover leaf necklace and staring at her mother's face.
     lost. lonely. missing her. she kisses the lucky charm,
     smiles at glynn, slips the necklace on.

                                                             57.
