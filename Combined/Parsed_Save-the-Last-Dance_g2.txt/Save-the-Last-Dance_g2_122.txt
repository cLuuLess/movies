166   int. hospital - i.c.u. waiting room/corridor - evening         166

      patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to arvel's
      parents, who are clearly stricken. arvel's father,
      stoic, holds his wife's hand. arvel's mother kneads a
      kleenex, her face etched with tears. patrick hugs her.
      stands up to see malakai frozen in the doorway, put off
      by the palpable grief. patrick crosses over to him.
      they retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for
      arvel a shaky ground for conciliation.

                                 malakai
                   why his mom's cryin' like that?
                   arvel's gonna make it, right?
                   that what's his nurse said. she
                   told me herself, 'your friend's
                   gonna make it.' did that bitch
                   lie to me! talk to me, patrick!
                   is he gone?

      patrick steers malakai away from the waiting room, backs
      him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds
      him there.

                                 patrick
                   they just got bad news, man. they
                   don't need to hear it again.
                          (trying to be
                           strong; faltering)
                   arvel's fightin'. he's gonna pull
                   through. thing is, when he does,
                   they don't think... he ain't...
                   shit. arvel ain't gonna walk
                   again.

      in that moment, whatever's left of malakai's soul
      crumbles. he looks at patrick with aggrieved disbelief
      and then a building anger. a stronger man would probably
      cry.

      patrick eases his grip. malakai straightens his body,
      cocks his head slightly. studies patrick in this
      crooked, derisive way.

                                 malakai
                   i got a good reason now, man?
                                 (more)

                                                     (continued)

                                                               110.

166   continued:                                                      166

                                 malakai (cont'd)
                          (off patrick's silence)
                   aw'ight, college boy. you do what
                   you think is the right thing.
                   i'ma do what i know is the only
                   thing.

      he starts to walk off, doesn't get far before patrick
      calls out.

                                 patrick
                   malakai...
                          (a fleeting hesitation)
                   ... when it's on, i'll be there.
