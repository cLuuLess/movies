118   int./ext. city bus - sara and patrick - later                      118

      the bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on.
      sits across from sara and patrick who have moved even
      closer to each other. patrick's arm is around sara's
      shoulder. he whispers something in sara's ear. she
      laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at
      them with a muted but obvious repugnance. watching the
      woman from the corner of her eye, sara drapes her arms
      around patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. patrick's
      eyes widen. sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds
      one of her legs between his and whispers:

                                 sara
                   we have an audience.      work with
                   me.

                                  patrick
                          (nonplussed)
                   work with you?

                                 sara
                          (sotto voce,
                           through her teeth)
                   grab something.

                                                         (continued)

                                                             72.

118   continued:                                                   118

      he grabs her ass   -- what else is there? -- runs his hand
      along her side.    the white woman, thoroughly disgusted,
      gets up and moves   to the back of the bus. patrick and
      sara look at each   other, burst out laughing.
