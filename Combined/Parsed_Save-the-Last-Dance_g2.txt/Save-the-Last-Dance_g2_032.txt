55   ext. patterson high - that day (after school)                 55

     sara exits with chenille. a car horn starts to blare.
     both of them ignore it. but it goes on like a musical
     number. sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a
     stone when she looks across the street. roy's parked at
     the curb, waiting for her. she rolls her eyes and he
     honks again. then he waves at her. waves! chenille
     looks at sara. then at roy.

                                chenille
                  that's your old man? now he's
                  cute.

                                sara
                  he's embarrassing.

                                 chenille
                          (laughs)
                  yeah.   he is. for you.
