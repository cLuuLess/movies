54   ext. quad - moments later                                       54

     sara follows chenille into the "quad," four squared off
     sections outside the cafeteria. there are a few dry-
     rotted picnic tables scattered around. other kids -- and
     they run the gamut -- are seen in clots, sneaking
     smokes... horsing around... making out.


     sara's pov - kids of quad

     and over the sound of hip-hop music, a pair of feet.
     moving. dancing. camera pans up to reveal nikki. she's
     demonstrating some moves to the girls from the popular
     table. nikki's dancing her ass off, showing off.


     back to scene

                                sara
                  what's it called? what she's
                  doing?

                                chenille
                  a dance.

                                sara
                         (a look; knows that)
                  no, i mean... the step, the...

     she trails off as she catches someone in the corner of
     her eye. she turns away from chenille, gradually
     focusing on --


     patrick

     playing cards with snookie at one of the picnic tables.
     he glances up to see sara. glowering at him. he grins.

     sara rolls her eyes, turns away.      mutters loudly to
     herself.

                                sara
                  asshole.

                                                     (continued)

                                                             22.

                            chenille
              asshole beaucoup. in this crowd,
              you gotta be more specific.

                            sara
                     (covertly indicates
                      patrick)
              he's in one of my classes. thinks
              he's so... smart. so cute.

                             chenille
               i don't know about cute but he is
               smart. real smart. real trip,
               too.

                             sara
               so you know him?

                             chenille
               patrick reynolds? hell yeah, i
               know him. he's my brother.

     chenille waits for sara to swallow her tongue.     enjoys a
     laugh.


     angle shifts to patrick

     as nikki approaches him. sexy, standoffish and
     conceited, she's the stuff of wet dreams and futile
     longing. she sits down next to patrick. close to him.
     snookie watches her, much amused.

                             nikki
               you comin' tonight?

     patrick keeps playing his hand.     responds very coolly.

                               patrick
               gotta work.

                             nikki
               you already skipped three
               meetings.
                      (as he's ignoring
                       her)
               is it because of me? everybody on
               the committee thinks it's because
               of me. us.
                      (infuriated by his
                       silence)
               look, patrick. regardless.
                             (more)

                                                   (continued)

                                nikki (cont'd)
                  you're in charge of the music.
                  i'm in charge of the prom. so
                  show up. don't make me fire your
                  ass.

     fighting words. snookie holds his breath. patrick
     throws out a card, turns slowly to nikki with a withering
     stare in his eyes.

                                patrick
                  you already fired my ass, nikki.
                  once and done. over. out. 'bye.

     she stalks off. snookie oogles her departure, peers at
     patrick, about to say something. patrick cuts him off,
     indicates cards.

                               patrick
                 hit me and shut the hell up.

                               snookie
                 i'ma shut up... after i say it
                 been real frigid 'round here since
                 y'all broke up. 'specially since
                 she broke up with you. that was
                 harsh, way she canceled your ass
                 like a stamp for that howard u
                 dude. but their shit's over. now
                 might be the time to forget
                 mistakes that was made. shoot.
                 you been with the girl since ninth
                 grade.

                                patrick
                  why you sweatin' me, snookie?

                                snookie
                         (pounding his heart)
                  'cause i'm about you, man. i want
                  a happy ending. aww, shit. tuck
                  an' duck. here he comes. the
                  hood of the 'hood, up to no good.


     their pov

     malakai rhinehart, 17, heading toward them. powerfully
     built and edgy with insolence, malakai is like a tightly-
     wound coil -- you never know when he's going to snap.
     angle widens and we see patrick is happy to see him. he
     and malakai grin at each other. knock handshakes.

                  medicine man...

                                snookie
                         (interjecting himself)
                  did i tell you, malakai, man, how
                  chill it is to have you back?
                  we ain't been bad without cha.

                                malakai
                  shut the fuck up and step your
                  lame ass off, snookie. you heard
                  me. space.

     snookie haughtily, comedically obliges.        a moment.

                                patrick
                  what happened to you at lunch,
                  man?

                                malakai
                  business.

     short-hand. patrick understands it, nods. malakai slips
     the cigarette from behind his ear, openly lights and
     starts smoking it. camera tracks them walking back
     toward patterson.

                                patrick
                  so you're hangin' in, man?
                  feelin' strong about being back?

                                malakai
                  not at this motherfucker. out a
                  week and where am i? fucking home
                  sweet high school. jail away from
                  jail. you can have it.

                                patrick
                  you gonna stay though.   right?

                                malakai
                  judge says it's school or juvee
                  and i sure as hell ain't goin'
                  back there. shit. i never knew a
                  year could be such a long time.

     a flash of commiseration, of guilt, crosses patrick's
     face. they're at the doors now. most of the kids have
     gone. malakai puts his cigarette out on the floor as
     they step in.

                  school? break your free-throw
                  back in. chump the chumps like we
                  used to.
