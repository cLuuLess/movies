      bedroom - night

      patrick enters to hear christopher screaming his lungs
      out. he passes down the hall to chenille's room to find
      christopher squirming in kenny's arms. kenny doesn't
      know what to do.

                                 patrick
                          (walking in)
                   what y'all doin' to my nephew?

      patrick takes christopher, holds him and consoles him
      until he settles down. patrick pointedly hands the baby
      to chenille, glares accusingly at her and kenny as he
      quits the room. kenny regards his son haplessly. looks
      at chenille.

                                 kenny
                   why's he do that?

                                  chenille
                   he's a baby.   they cry.

                                 kenny
                   he was screaming, chenille.

                              chenille
                he don't know you, kenny.

                                 kenny
                   i'm his father. he knows me.
                          (meaning now)
                   ... what should i do?

                                 chenille
                   come around more often.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                 65.

                                   kenny
                   see?    i can't talk to you.

                                 chenille
                   and i can't depend on you! am i
                   askin' you to do anything for him
                   you ain't supposed to do?

                                 kenny
                   you don't ask, chenille. you make
                   demands. you want money, you --

                                 chenille
                   -- i want you to pick up some of
                   the slack. you always have an
                   excuse.

                                 kenny
                   it's not like that.    i get tied
                   up.

                                 chenille
                   you wanna talk about tied up? try
                   gettin' up in the middle of the
                   night to change diapers and give
                   him bottles or stayin' up with him
                   when he's sick and havin' to drag
                   your ass to school the next day.

                                   kenny
                   look.    i'm doin' the best i can.

                                 chenille
                   it ain't good enough, kenny!
