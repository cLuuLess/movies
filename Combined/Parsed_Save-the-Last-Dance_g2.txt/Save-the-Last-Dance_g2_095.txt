      sara and patrick, post-coital. she's in her robe. he's
      dressed but they're fooling around as they fix
      sandwiches. patrick drops down in a chair. sara drops
      down on his lap.

                                 patrick
                   what's your favorite flower?

                                 sara
                   i don't have a favorite.

                                 patrick
                   yeah, but if you did...

                                 sara
                   i dunno. maybe cymbidiums --
                   orchids. they're sort of show-
                   boaty but they're pretty.

                                 patrick
                   what's your favorite color?

                                    sara
                   agua.

                                 patrick
                   what's your second favorite color?

                                    sara
                   mmm.    mauve.

                                 patrick
                   you're makin' this real hard,
                   sara. those ain't exactly tuxedo
                   colors.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                  87.

      sara swings her legs around, facing him, straddling him.

                                  sara
                   nut.   what are you talking about?

                                 patrick
                   i was tryin' to get around to
                   askin' you somethin' but since i'm
                   some sorta nut, you probably
                   wouldn't wanna go to prom with
                   me...

      she throws her arms around his neck, kissing him.
      patrick slides his hands under her robe, cups her
      breasts. sara responds to him. they are too engrossed
      in this intimacy to hear the front door opening, to see
      roy until he walks in and sees them. sara leaps up,
      closes her robe. patrick doesn't know what to do. he's
      caught. straight up. red-handed. roy's eyes dart
      between them, settle on and slice into patrick.

                                 roy
                   patrick -- it is patrick, isn't
                   it?
                          (a small awkward nod)
                   well, i think you were just
                   leavin'.

      patrick stands up.      sara grabs his arm defiantly, holds
      him back.

                                 sara
                   why does he have to leave?   we're
                   all adults. right?

                                 roy
                   he either leaves or i throw his
                   ass out. your call, sara.

      patrick jerks his arm free from sara, grabs his jacket
      off the back of his chair. he back-talks roy as he
      passes him.

                                 patrick
                   chill, man. i'm goin'. you don't
                   have to come off with all 'at.

                             roy
               who the hell are you to tell
               me how to come off? you're in my
               house alone with my daughter.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               88.

139   continued:                                                     139

      it takes everything patrick has to keep walking until
      he's out the door. it slams behind him. sara marches up
      to roy, furious.

                              sara
                i hate being your daughter.    you
                ruin everything.

      she tries to stomp off.    roy kicks a chair in her path.
      snarls.

                              roy
               siddown.
                      (not a request; an
                        order; as she sits)
               it's a free country, you can hate
               me. ain't like that's exactly
               news. but disrespectin' me,
               that's where the road ends, sara.
               i don't want him up here again. i
               mean it.

                             sara
               you mean it because he's black.

                             roy
               don't start that bullshit!

                             sara
               why's it bullshit? because you
               hang with black guys and play jazz
               and have the hots for angela
               bassett?

                             roy
               because he was in my house with
               his hands all over my daughter!

                              sara
                keep telling yourself that. just
                don't expect me to believe it. i
                saw how you looked at him. but
                you didn't see him. well, for
                your information, he's a straight-
                a student with more heart and guts
                than you'll ever have!

                                 roy
                   yeah? well, when are you gonna
                   have the guts to say what you
                   really want to say to me, sara?

                                                     (continued)

                                                               89.

                                 sara
                          (screaming at him)
                   want me to say it? you were a
                   piece of shit husband and you're a
                   piece of shit father! you were
                   never there for mom or for me.
                   you took off and never looked
                   back. so don't talk to me about
                   guts.

      not quite the truth, but near enough to sting. it quiets
      roy down. he regards her with regret and guilt.

                                 roy
                   sounds like you have it all
                   figured out.

                             sara
               i have you figured out. you think
               you can make up all the time you
               missed, all the things you didn't
               do? you can't! i'm here because
               i have to be and it's a goddamned
               nightmare.

                             roy
               well, you might as well wake up
               and get used to it, sara, because
               that's the way things are
               sometimes, the way life is.

                             sara
               how the hell would you know?
               you've been asleep for the past
               thirty-seven years!

      now she does storm off. this time roy lets her.     he
      can't find the words to deny what she's said.
