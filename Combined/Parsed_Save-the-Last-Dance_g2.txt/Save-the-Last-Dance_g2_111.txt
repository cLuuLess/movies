155   int. reynolds' apartment - chenille's bedroom - night           155

      chenille and kenny.     in the middle of a contentious
      moment. he tries to     give her some money. she snatches
      it out of his hand.     kenny looks at her. he's hurt.
      chenille's too mad to    see it.

                                 chenille
                   what? i'm supposed to get excited
                   because you decided to skate by
                   and drop a dollar on the dresser?

                                 kenny
                   it's more than a dollar. and it's
                   all i got.
                          (beat)
                   i got laid off rom b.w.i.,
                   chenille. i been workin' part-
                   time. money's tight. you know
                   how you are about money. that's
                   way i haven't been coming around.

      chenille stares at him for a long moment.       her voice is
      low.

                                 chenille
                   money ain't got nothin' to do with
                   it, kenny. you don't come around
                   because you don't feel like comin'
                   around. you don't want the
                   responsibility of comin' around.
                   as long as you out there and i'm
                   in here, you know your son's being
                   taken care of. you ain't got no
                   worries when it comes to him.

                                 kenny
                   and you don't have no   feelings
                   when it comes to me.    all you do
                   is bitch and complain   about what i
                   don't do. i get sick    of that.

                                 chenille
                   be sick of it. you ain't got to
                   see me to see your son.

                                 kenny
                   i'll be sure to keep that in mind.

      he leaves.    chenille stands there, mad at him.    mad at
      herself.
