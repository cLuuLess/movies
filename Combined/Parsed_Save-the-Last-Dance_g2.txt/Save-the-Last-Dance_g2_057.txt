82   ext. feetz - outside vestibule - continuous action               82

     the exit door bursts open and patrick and malakai tumble
     out. patrick bends over, cups his knees as he catches
     his breath.

                                patrick
                  man, what the hell are you doin'?
                  tryin' to get sent back up?

                                malakai
                  they the ones tryin' shit. comin'
                  here. squarin' off in my shit.

                                patrick
                  you couldn't let it slide?

                                                      (continued)

                                                            46.

                                malakai
                  let it slide tonight, they come
                  back strong tomorrow. you know
                  that.

                            patrick
              malakai, you fuck up parole, you
              ain't gonna back to juvee.
              eighteen and up, that's jessup.
              hardcore lockdown. you want that?

                                malakai
                         (regards him coldly)
                  i want what was mine. feetz is my
                  spot. i'ma do business here just
                  like i did before. like we did
                  before. and if i gotta stomp some
                  niggers in my way, so be it.

     an uncertain but tense moment.     patrick tries to salvage
     it.

                                patrick
                  well, you definitely got the
                  stompin' part down.

     they look at each other.     share a small laugh.

                                malakai
                  we fucked those fools up for sure.

                                patrick
                         (crossing to exit door)
                  for damn sure, man.

     patrick finds the door locked. he and malakai hoist
     themselves over a high, wrought iron fence. disappear
     behind it.
