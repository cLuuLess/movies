15   int. univ. of pennsylvania - stage/auditorium -              15
     moments later

     sara on stage. she looks past a row of juilliard judges
     into the audience. no glint of gold. mozart's "elvira
     madigan" (andante) cues up. sara begins her technical.
     she transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful
     performance. the judges are mutely but clearly
     impressed. one of them looks directly at her.

                                                   (continued)

                                                          7.

                                judge
                  is there anything you'd like to
                  share about your free form before
                  you begin? a motif... a theme?

     sara's stomach drops to her feet. her mother's not there
     and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme.
     shit!

                                sara
                  well, it's um, pretty self-
                  explanatory. the theme.

     the judges exchange a look. new music cues up. some
     driving, classical number.   sara tries to elevate her
     body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her
     feet. she keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium
     for glynn. searching for her port in the storm.
     wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's
     dancing. knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling,
     recovering, and finally finishing with those damned
     knocking knees. the judges, eyes like stones,
     perfunctorily nod. their equivalent of maybe next year.
     sara chokes two words out...

                                sara
                  thank you.
