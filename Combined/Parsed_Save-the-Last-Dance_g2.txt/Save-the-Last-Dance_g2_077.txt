      they lay on their bellies in the grass.       close to each
      other.

                                 patrick
                   i stole a bike here once.

                                 sara
                   why'd you do that?

                                 patrick
                   'cause i didn't have one.

                                 sara
                   that's a good reason.

                                 patrick
                   i used to do wild shit like that.

                                 sara
                   you and malakai?

                                  patrick
                   yep.   most of the time.

                                 sara
                   i don't get you guys.    you seem
                   so... different.

                                  patrick
                   we're not.

                                 sara
                   maybe you weren't then but you are
                   now. you said you changed.

                                 patrick
                   doesn't make me different from
                   him. not the way you think it
                   does.

                                 sara
                   i think malakai's scary.   and i
                   know you're not.

                                 patrick
                          (taking mild umbrage)
                   what you mean by scary? 'kai's
                   tough. he has to be. he still
                   got a good heart. i know.

      sara stares at the ground, struggling to tell him what
      she saw.

                                 sara
                   patrick.

                                 patrick
                   let me finish. me and him got
                   into some shit awhile back. real
                   bad shit. we held up a gas
                   station off 95. i bailed the ride
                   -- jumped out the car. 'kai kept
                   goin', got caught.
                          (pauses)
                   i knew what he was gonna do that
                   night. knew the car was hot. i
                   woulda been guilty as him if they
                   had caught me, if malakai had
                   served my name up. but he didn't.

                                 sara
                   that means you owe him something?

                                 patrick
                   he did his time plus most of mine.
                   i owe him that.

                                 sara
                   no matter how much he messes up?

                              patrick
                we all mess up. maybe malakai
                gave up. but he's still m'boy and
                he still got a chance. i ain't
                just gonna cross him completely
                off and be like everybody else.

      he looks at her and she doesn't have the heart -- or the
      nerve -- to tell him. a long moment. she plucks a
      dandelion from the grass, twirls it thoughtfully in her
      fingers.

                                 sara
                   i stole a hat once. when i was
                   twelve. my mom found it under my
                   mattress, made me take it back.

                                    patrick
                   gangsta' sara.     stole a hat.   call
                   the f.b.i.

      she looks at him.       smiles.   twirls the dandelion under
      his nose.

                                 sara
                   you gonna turn me in?

                                 patrick
                   i think i'll wait for you to
                   surrender.
                          (pauses)
                   were you tight with your mom,
                   sara? i mean, y'all get along and
                   shit?

                                 sara
                          (guardedly)
                   yeah...tight... got along and shit

                                 patrick
                   so she meant something to you.
                   how come you never talk about her?

                                 sara
                   there's nothing to say.

                                 patrick
                          (studying her face)
                   know why there's nothing to say?
                   because you don't talk about her.
                   you won't talk about her.

                                 sara
                   i'm sorry she's dead. god! what
                   do you want me to do? run through
                   the streets screaming?

                                   patrick
                   why not?    if it helps.

                                 sara
                          (tersely)
                   well, it won't. so drop it.

                                 patrick
                   and you call malakai scary.

                                                        (continued)

      she looks at him. patrick grins. sara knocks her legs
      against his. he knocks his legs back. a silly moment.
      but it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce
      between them.
