161   int. patterson high - sara's locker/hallway -                    161
      later that day

      sara's at her locker. patrick walks up to her. she
      looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on
      his face.

                                    sara
                   hi.

      patrick doesn't say anything at first.       but then:

                                                       (continued)

                                                            106.

161   continued:                                                    161

                                 patrick
                   thought you might need this on
                   saturday. i ain't gonna be able
                   to make it.

      he hands her an audio cassette of her free form music.
      sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this
      means. she won't let him see how it shatters her. he
      hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. but
      sara turns her back on him and patrick walks away.


      another angle - toni

      approaching sara's locker. having seen the encounter
      between patrick and sara, she's as smug and overbearing
      as ever.

                                 toni
                   lovers' quarrel? you're better
                   off. that menace to society
                   would've broken your heart and
                   spent all your money in a news
                   flash. trust me on that, sara.

      sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. she
      resists the urge to slap the smile off toni's face.   she
      gets in it instead.

                                 sara
                   toni, listen carefully. you're a
                   simple bitch and you don't have
                   any friends, black or white,
                   because nobody likes a fucking
                   asshole.

      she storms off leaving toni, for once, speechless.
