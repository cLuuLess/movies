67   int. gymnasium - night                                           67

     over the sound of grunting... open close on a girl's
     plump ass. squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug
     the cheeks. angle widens to reveal a stout white girl on
     a balance beam. trying to get her legs to stand up on
     it. hanging on for dear life. from somewhere around
     her, a whistle blows.

                                teacher (o.s.)
                  alright, ms. diggs. time!

     widen to see the teacher and her class (favor sara,
     chenille, and nikki). amid snickers, the stout girl
     ("diggy") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher
     with her head demurely cast down. clearing the teacher,
     diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air.
     gives up the double bird with much attitude. the class
     loves it. cheers it. until the teacher swerves around.


67   series of close cuts                                             67

     chenille on balance beam.    competent but average.

     nikki on balance beam.    agile.   self-assured.   good.

     ... and then tighter still on sara. tentatively
     approaching the balance beam. mindful of all the eyes on
     her, all the bated breaths. all waiting to see the new
     girl fall on her ass. sara swings herself onto the beam
     with aplomb. her legs and body are strong, supple,
     pliable rubber bands. she flounces across it on her
     tiptoes. does a flawless split. hops off. looks out.


     sara's pov - teacher and class

     reacting with shock and surprise. awed. except for
     nikki. she stands there with her arms folded.
     simmering. envious.

     sara. heading down the steps with other students.
     chenille and diggy break through the logjam, catch up to
     her.
                                                (continued)

                                chenille
                  girl, how you get your legs to
                  twist like that?

                                diggy
                         (wildly gesticulating)
                  yeah. what was all that double-
                  jointed cheerleader shit?

                                   chenille
                  this is diggy.     thinks she's down.

                                   diggy
                  egg-cuse me?     i am down.

                                 chenille
                  so, sara.   what's up with that?

                                sara
                         (awkwardly)
                  nothing's up with it. i used to
                  kind of dance. ballet. mostly.

     chenille makes an impressed face.          regards sara
     curiously.

                                chenille
                  you should hit feetz with us
                  tomorrow night. it's a club.
                  sorta members only.

                                   diggy
                  un-der-ground.

                            sara
              i don't know...

                            chenille
              come on and hang out. snook dee's
              sometime. he can get you in.
                     (yelling)
              yo, snook

     sara sees snookie... then patrick... loping her way. she
     steels herself. he's going to say something, crack some
     joke about her nearly blowing him up. but patrick just
     stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. a nice
     twinkle. sara's not entirely immune to it. chenille
     breaks their eye play, pushes patrick aside. she grabs
     snookie's arm, indicates sara.

                                                        (continued)

                                                               33.

68   continued:                                                      68

                                chenille
                  she needs to get hooked up for
                  feetz. all the way up. sara,
                  give snook twenty dollars.

                                sara
                  for what?

                                snookie
                  i.d. eye-dee. how you think you
                  gettin' in? on your looks?
                         (rolling his eyes)
                  chenille, your girl is weak.
                  shit. i got my rep to watch. i
                  can't just be gettin' any green
                  in.

     sara glares.     regards snookie with a sweeping scowl.

                                sara
                  look closer. and if i still look
                  green, i think maybe you should
                  wipe the crust from your eyes.

     snookie's jaw drops. patrick cracks up. diggy too.
     chenille's stays on point. she's about solving the
     problem.

                                chenille
                  you gonna pay the man or what?

                                snookie
                  she ain't got it. look at her.
                  loud-talkin' me and broke as a
                  damn promise.

     sara, put on the spot, pulls out the money.     snookie
     snatches it.

                                sara
                  i don't even know where it is.

                                chenille
                  so we'll hook up at my house. go
                  together. i will have your i.d.

     snookie shrugs affirmatively. patrick looks directly at
     sara. the twinkle in his eye is gone, replaced by fair
     warning.

                            patrick
              feetz ain't no square dance.

                            sara
              that's okay. i dance in circles.
              probably around you.

                                                            34.
