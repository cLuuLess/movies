83   ext. feetz - front entrance - night                           83

     distant wail of sirens as feetz begins to empty out.
     kids converge on the sidewalks. pick up sara, chenille
     and diggy. waiting and watching for patrick. diggy
     looks at them.

                                diggy
                  it's about to get real out here.
                  cops and shit. i'm gone.

     she leaves. chenille spots patrick. not too worse for
     the wear. she smiles with relief. then sara sees him.
     she smiles too.

                                                           47.
