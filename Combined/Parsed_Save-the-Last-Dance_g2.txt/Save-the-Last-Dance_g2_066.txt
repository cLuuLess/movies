91   ext./int. street/roy's rowhouse (so. baltimore) - day           91

     sara walks up the street (passing many black people),
     sees roys' pickup. shit. he's home.


92   camera tracks                                                   92

     sara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of
     stairs to their apartment. there's a jazz instrumental
     faintly coming from it. and another noise. foreign and
     yet familiar. like grunting... but not. sara unlocks
     the door. opens it.


93   sara's pov - living room                                        93

     her father's fucking somebody! on the couch. half on it
     anyway. in broad daylight! the whore underneath him is
     moaning. jesus!

     angle widens as sara turns away from the spectacle.
     reaches for roy's sax. she blows the longest, shrillest
     note known to mankind.


94   on roy                                                          94

     the hair on his head stands up.    his body deflates
     instantly.
