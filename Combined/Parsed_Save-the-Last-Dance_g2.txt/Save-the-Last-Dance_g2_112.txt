      the room is filled with young women, most them black, and
      children of all ages. they are piled up like cars on a
      freeway, waiting to be seen. the noise level is at a
      peak when chenille and sara walk in. chenille's carrying
      a fussy christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack.
      sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for christopher.

                                 sara
                   want me to take him?

      chenille shakes her head. walks to reception to sign
      herself in. sara takes in the faces of girls younger
      than herself, the grime and gloom of the room. it's
      incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children
      are brought to get well. chenille finishes at the desk.
      returns to sara. they cross to a corner of the clinic
      where they sit -- on the floor. chenille indicates the
      receptionist bitterly.

                                 chenille
                   that wench. you gotta stand over
                   her to make sure she puts your
                   name on the damn list. triflin'
                   bitch.

      chenille starts to change christopher's diaper. he
      starts to wail and flail. chenille can't placate him.
      one of his kicks connects with chenille's open backpack,
      sends books and papers flying. sara can see the veins
      stand up on chenille's neck.

                                   sara
                   i'll get 'em.

      she does. chenille's finally got control of christopher
      but he's still crying. chenille slips off his dirty
      diaper. when sara hands her a clean one, chenille
      regards her strangely, as if just remembering that she's
      there.

                                 chenille
                   so your old man flipped about the
                   fight.
                          (with some animus)
                   probably thinks it's all patrick's
                   fault.

                                  sara
                   no.   i explained about nikki.

                                 chenille
                   right. you put it all on her.
                   none of it's on you.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               99.

                                 sara
                   she started it, chenille. she
                   wanted to start it. i told you
                   what she said.

      chenille flashes a look, finishes up with christopher.
      she picks him up, puts a bottle in his mouth. cradles
      him.

                                 chenille
                   maybe she didn't have no business
                   gettin' in your face. but she had
                   a reason to say what she said.

      a reason?    sara studies her, trying to fathom the remark.

                                 sara
                   so you agree with her? you think
                   i don't belong with patrick.

                                  chenille
                   what i think don't matter. but
                   you and him act like it don't
                   bother people that you're
                   together. like it don't hurt
                   people to see.

                                 sara
                          (her irish up)
                   we like each other. what is the
                   big fucking deal? it's him and
                   me. not us and other 'people.'

      the white girl with the rose-colored reasoning. chenille
      glares at sara, her voice designed to snatch the blinders
      off.

                                chenille
                  black people, sara. black women.
                         (passionately)
                  patrick's about somethin'. he's
                  smart. he's motivated. he's for
                  real. he ain't gonna make no
                  babies and not take care of 'em or
                  run the streets, fuck up his life.
                  he's gonna do somethin' with
                  himself. here you come, white and
                  right, and you take one of the few
                  decent men left after jail, drugs
                  and drive-bys. that's what nikki
                  meant about you up in our world.

      sara sits there, stupefied.    understanding.    not
      understanding.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               100.

                                 sara
                   there's only one world, chenille.
                          (pauses)
                   i thought we were friends. guess
                   i was wrong.

      she gets up, walks out. something in chenille wants to
      call after her, but she's too miserable, too torn up
      inside to do it.
