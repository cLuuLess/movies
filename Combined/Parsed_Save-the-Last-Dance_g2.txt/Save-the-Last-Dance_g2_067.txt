     sara sits at the table. roy enters in a wrinkled t-shirt
     and battered jeans. his embarrassment is naked.

                             roy
               i don't know what to say.    i
               don't.

                             sara
               how 'bout fuck it? or should i
               say fuck her? it's a fuck-fest,
               roy.

                                roy
               don't talk to    me like that, sara.
                      (beat)
               i thought you    were goin' to your
               friend's house    after school.
               obviously, you    changed your mind.
               so i'm sorry.     alright?

                             sara
               sorry you got caught.

                                                      (continued)

                                                            56.

                                roy
                  sorry i got... observed

     the "whore" with the hich c is rhonda. she stands
     between the living area and the kitchen entrance now.
     sara tries not to look at her. can't help it. she has
     to see the whore. not bad looking, in a washed out,
     bottle blonde barfly kind of way.

                                rhonda
                  don't be mad at him. it's my
                  fault. i'm real sorry, honey.

                                roy
                  it's nobody's 'fault.' it's over.
                  let it be over. we're all adults.

     sara glares at him.     the disingenuous rhonda jumps in.

                                rhonda
                  i think he means you know about
                  sex. that we have it and he likes
                  it. isn't that what you mean,
                  roy?

     sara looks at her.     bats her eyes.   hard.

                                 sara
                  really?   how often do you have it?

                                rhonda
                  things been kind of slow since you
                  got here. once upon a time we
                  were real rabbits, weren't we,
                  roy?

     verbal quicksand.      roy can feel himself sinking.

                                 roy
                  rhonda.   shut up.   please.
