65   int. chemistry lab - later that morning                       65

     the class has donned lab coats and is ready   to begin when
     sarah rushes in. she tries to slink into a    seat. the
     teacher, mr. hill, gives her a disapproving   look, points
     at one of several formulas (c2,h6,o2) on the   blackboard.
     sara just looks at him

                             mr. hill
               we're cooking today, ms. johnson.
               this is your first lab. you'll
               need a partner. mr. reynolds --
               patrick -- will show you the
               ropes.

     patrick bounces a smile off unsettled sara.     this should
     be fun.
