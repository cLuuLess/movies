7   int. sara's exeter house - living room - day                  7

    a pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood
    floor. pan up and pull back to reveal sara at 17,
    dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and
    rolled up rugs. as glynn looks on, sara completes the
    routine with a pirouette. she spins out of it with a
    preoccupied frown on her face.

                            glynn
               what's the matter?   it was good.

                            sara
                    (checks her
                     stance in mirror)
             everybody there's going to be
             good, mom. i have to be better.
                    (then, beginning
                     again)
             my knees still knock when i do my
             free form. did you notice that?

                           glynn
             i noticed that it was fine.

                           sara
                    (escalating
                     frustration)
             it's not supposed to be fine.
             it's supposed to be special.
                           (more)

                                                 (continued)

                                                              3.

7   continued:                                                     7

                           sara (cont'd)
             and it just lays there, it doesn't
             do anything. i bet they notice
             that. that it doesn't do
             anything. that i don't do
             anything special enough to get in.

                                glynn
                 sara.   you'll get in.

                               sara
                 don't lie because you love me.     my
                 free form sucks.

                               glynn
                        (giving up that
                         battle)
                 i've got something for you. come
                 on. sit. mouth closed, eyes
                 shut. no pouting. no peeking.

    sara flops down on the sofa beside her. closes her eyes.
    glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it
    around sara's.

                               glynn
                 for luck tomorrow. not that
                 you'll need it. you dance like an
                 angel.

    the necklace is glynn's talisman. sara knows what it
    means to her. she throws her arms around glynn, holds
    onto her tightly.

                               sara
                 i love the necklace but you're
                 still the best luck i'll ever
                 have.

    glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up.        they cling to
    each other.
