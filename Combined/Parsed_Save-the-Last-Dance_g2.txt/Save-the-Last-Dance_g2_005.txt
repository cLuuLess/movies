    in the blink of her eyes, the memory fades. she pulls
    the window shade, shifts in her seat. her fingers travel
    to the clover necklace at her throat. linger. the woman
    regards her.

                               woman
                 nice... the necklace.

     the woman's wearing a crucifix.     she indicates it.

     a sea of young white faces. a jock entertains the troops
     with two straws up his nose. sara sits next to her best
     friend, lindsay, 17. lindsay, chomping on a wad of gum,
     turns from the jock to sara with a bubble in bloom,
     bursts it with her teeth.

                                lindsay
                  wanna pray? you're leaving for
                  philly after first period. i
                  won't see you. we should pray.

                                sara
                         (stupefied)
                  lindsay... no. not here.

     lindsay grabs sara's hand and bows her head.      sara,
     embarrassed, aligns her head with lindsay's.      she's
     praying nobody sees them.

                                lindsay
                  'awesome, father, s.j. auditions
                  today. she's ready for them.
                  please make them ready for her.
                  even if she screws up. thanks.
                  amen.'
                         (sure shrug; another
                          bubble)
