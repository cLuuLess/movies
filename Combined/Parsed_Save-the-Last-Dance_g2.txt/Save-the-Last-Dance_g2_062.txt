87   int. record store (east point mall) - day                        87

     a track from top dogg blares from invisible speakers.
     all of the store's many customers are teenage kids.
     snookie, in sunglasses and a reversed baseball cap,
     clerks behind the counter. he's ringing up (and trying
     to rap to) a fly girl when patrick walks in, overhears
     the overture.

                                    snookie
                  ... how   you   know i can't do
                  nothin'   for   you? i'm the hardest
                  workin'   man   in showbizness, girl.
                  c'mon.    let   me be the bomb in your
                  shell.

     the fly girl rolls her eyes. takes her bag. leaves.
     patrick looks at snookie, wryly shakes his head.

                                patrick
                  you do the shit to yourself, man.
                  the bomb in your shell?

                                snookie
                  that was black magic, patrick.
                  it's gonna work one of these days.

     he reaches behind the counter, hands patrick a jay-z c.d.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              52.

                                snookie
                  last one on the rack. i snatched
                  it up for you. rang it up on my
                  discount.

                                patrick
                         (what snookie's
                          waiting for)
                  thank you, snookie.

                                snookie
                         (as patrick pays him)
                  you workin' or what, man?

                                 patrick
                  on my way.   soon as i get outta
                  here...

     as he says this, his eyes wander around the store.      and
     he sees her in the stacks. sara.
