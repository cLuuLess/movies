119   ext. baltimore hall - night                                  119

      the equivalent of d.c.'s kennedy center, the hall is
      awash in lights and activity. men and women are donned
      in formal attire. parking valets hover on the sidewalks
      waiting for cars. into this, sara and patrick walk. she
      looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner --
      "boston ballet, a command performance." sara's heart
      stops. her feet freeze. patrick looks at her. she
      looks positively catatonic.

                                 patrick
                   surprise... sara?

                                 sara
                          (quietly urgent)
                   i can't. i can't go in.

                                 patrick
                          (doesn't understand)
                   you have to go in. this is where
                   i'm bringing you. the ballet.

                                  sara
                          (beside herself)
                   i know, but --

                             patrick
                      (crestfallen)
               but what?

      sara looks at him, feeling bad. feeling stupid for
      ruining the evening. she bites her lip, shakes her head
      ("but nothing"). patrick takes her and they go in.
