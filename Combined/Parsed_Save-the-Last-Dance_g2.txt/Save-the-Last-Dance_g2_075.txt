112   int. patterson high - girls' lavatory - morning                  112

      dripping, out-of-order faucets, graffiti-laced stalls,
      litter-strewn floors are underscored by the spooky
      flicker of fluorescent lights. sara walks in. the
      bathroom appears to be empty. she's about to enter a
      stall when she hears the murmur of a voice. a guy's
      voice. then a girl's whimper. she eases forward a bit.

                                 girl (o.s.)
                   i don't get paid 'til next week.

                                 male (o.s.)
                   boo the fuck hoo. you can't put
                   my bizness up your nose on no
                   layaway plan. c'mon now. you
                   know what you gotta do.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                 66.

112   continued:                                                       112

      sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the
      stall's open door. she cranes her neck trying to see
      without being sen.


      her pov - stall

      a girl is seated on the toilet. a man straddles her, his
      crotch in her face. the girl sees sara. something in
      her face gives this away. the "man" glances out past his
      shoulder. he looks right down our throat straight into
      sara's eyes. malakai.


      on sara

                                 sara
                   what are you doing?

      malakai backs up. the girl jumps up, runs out the
      lavatory. malakai zips up his pants. sara's frozen,
      staring at him.

                                 malakai
                   you didn't see nothin', you don't
                   say nothin'. not unless you want
                   a taste for yourself. and that
                   can be arranged.

      he leaves.     sara waits a moment.   exits.


113   hallway                                                          113

      she sees mr. hill, starts to move for him. someone grabs
      her arm from behind. she turns, startled, a little
      afraid. it's the girl from the stall. she looks sara in
      the eye. shakes her head. don't. mr. hill walks by
      them unbeckoned.
