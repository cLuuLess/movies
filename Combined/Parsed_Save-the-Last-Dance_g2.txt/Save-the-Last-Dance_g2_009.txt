13   int. amtrak train (moving) - on sara - night (present)       13

     feigning sleep. from the corner of her eye, she watches
     the woman beside her flip through the american ballet
     magazine. we move back in time through their pages.


14   flashback - int. university of pennsylvania - waiting        14
     room - day

     sara, in costume, flips through a magazine. she taps her
     toes, checks her watch. a phalanx of parents and dancers
     are clustered around a sign posted on the door:
     juilliard school of dance auditions. sara stares at it.
     re-checks her watch. an official with a clipboard walks
     toward her. where's her mother?
