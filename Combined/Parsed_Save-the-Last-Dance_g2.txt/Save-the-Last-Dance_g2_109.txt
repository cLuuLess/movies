153   int. roy's rowhouse - hallway - night                          153

      patrick rings the doorbell. sara opens the door
      slightly, just enough for patrick to see her face.      it
      pisses him off.

                                   patrick
                   shit!

                                   sara
                   it's alright.    i'm okay.

      roy appears in the space behind her, looking out.      sara
      can feel his presence. her eyes implore patrick.

                                 sara
                   look.  it's not a good time.
                          (gently shutting
                           the door)
                   i'll see you later... i'm okay.
