62   int./ext city bus/baltimore streets - morning                  62

     the bus is crammed with kids. sara, seated by a window,
     doesn't bother looking out. inside's more interesting.
     the kids cut up. singing, rapping, and jousting with
     each other. some even manage to read. sara watches with
     immunity. she's invisible to them.
