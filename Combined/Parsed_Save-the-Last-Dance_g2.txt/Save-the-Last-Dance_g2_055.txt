     malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner.
     she licks his ear, whispers into it. malakai laughs.
     then his expression abruptly darkens. a storm cloud
     comes over it. he gets up.


     malakai's pov - walking toward

     ... two dealers a few feet away. they're talking to an
     asian guy with a multi-colored mohawk. one slips mohawk
     a packet of coke, the other takes his money. wider as
     malakai reaches the dealers. he doesn't explain, doesn't
     complain. he just starts swinging.


     sara and patrick

     the music changes and their dance ends. they stand there
     for a moment, a little caught up in each other. a little
     unsure of the moment. and then there's a scream!
     several of them actually. patrick reacts to it
     instinctively. looking around. in a small pocket of the
     club he sees malakai.

     patrick's pov - malakai

     in full fisticuffs with the two dealers.     holding his
     own.


     on patrick

     leaving sara, slicing through a clot of looky-loos until
     he reaches malakai. he jumps into the fray.
