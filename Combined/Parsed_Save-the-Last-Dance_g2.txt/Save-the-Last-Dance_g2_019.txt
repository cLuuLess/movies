30   int./ext. roy's pickup/street - sara and roy - night        30

     a heavy silence. roy starts to turn on the radio, stops
     himself. he lights a cigarette, cracks the window.

                                                   (continued)

                                                           10.

30   continued:                                                  30

                                roy
                  i didn't like leavin' you so soon
                  after the funeral. i wouldn't
                  have if you hadn't asked me to go.
                  i mean, i could've hung around.
                  helped you say good-bye. that's
                  what you were doin', wasn't it?

                                  sara
                  uh-huh.

     roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.

                                roy
                  that's what i figured you were
                  doin'.

     sara peers out    the windshield. baltimore city. the
     neighborhoods    are changing. the streets are getting
     progressively    gritty and dirty. it surprises her. it
     worries her.     roy worries her.

                                roy
                  look. sara. i feel bad too. i
                  mean, we both got hit by the same
                  bolt of lightning. you don't have
                  to pretend this is easy.
                         (off nothing)
                  everything's upside down right now
                  but don't worry. we'll work this
                  bachelor-father thing out. hell,
                  it ain't like we're movin' in with
                  strangers. we got a pretty good
                  idea about each other, right?

     sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating
     otherwise. a moment. roy's too new at this to hold up
     both ends of the conversation. the silence deepens. roy
     switches on the radio.
