     roy's pickup pulls in. roy cuts the engine. sara looks
     at him. or through him. she won't let his eyes connect.

                             sara
               you don't have to go in with me.
               since i'm all set. i mean, i have
               done this before. gone to school.
               i'll be fine. i am fine. really.

     roy regards her with weary resignation.   sara climbs out.
     he calls after her.

                             roy
               -- pick you up. three-thirty.

                              sara
