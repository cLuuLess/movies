     lunchtime. pick up sara among a cattle drive of
     boisterous students.


45   cafeteria - food line - later                                        45

     hundreds of voices unleashed in pure, unadulterated
     teenage cacophony. sara's in a queue of kids, working
     her way down the line.

     she's as invisible and anonymous as ever. camera tracks
     her from the line, to the cashier, into the heart of the
     dining hall. she stands with a food tray, looking for a
     place to sit.

46   jock table                                                    46

     two tables pushed together.    full.


47   nerd table                                                    47

     barely, pathetically populated but surprisingly diverse.


48   hip-hop table                                                 48

     loud, overflowing, fun.    king patrick and his loyal
     subjects horse around.


49   popular table                                                 49

     over which a glacial beauty we will come to know as nikki
     davis presides. girls only.


50   white table

     notable for its glaring absence of color.    a girl we will
     come to know as toni sits there.

     and then pushing in on --


51   chenille's table                                              51

     she's there with a group of girls who eschew pretense.
     they, like chenille, are rugged and regular. they know
     who they are.

     end of series of sweeping shots.

                                                             20.

52   angle on sara                                                 52

     eyeing chenille's table. screwing up courage as she
     approaches it. she gets there but two black girls are
     faster. they sit down in the only empty seats. sara
     backs off, invisible again.


     on chenille

     glimpsing sara from the corner of her eye as sara walks
     away.

     time has    passed. the cafeteria is half as full, half as
     noisy.     sara sits among the nerds, a friendly if verbose
     group.     she's trying to eat but a snooze button is
     talking    her to death...

                                wonk
                  ... i know you're new to the
                  table, but think about it. we're
                  the y2k generation and nobody
                  takes us seriously. we don't take
                  ourselves seriously. just look
                  around. half the student body is
                  d.o.a. -- and that's from the neck
                  up, clara.

                                 sara
                  sara.   it's sara.

                                chenille (o.s.)
                  yeah. it's sara. and you're
                  boring her from the ears down.

     sara looks up, surprised to see chenille standing there.
     she flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates sara's
     tray.

                                  chenille
                  you finished?

     sara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod. beats a hasty
     retreat from the table. as she and chenille walk through
     the cafeteria, sara shudders with relief. she feels
     rescued.

                                  sara
                  god!    thank you!

                                                   (continued)

                                                               21.

53   continued:                                                      53

                                chenille
                         (laughs)
                  gotta watch where you sit, girl.
                  and it's chenille. but you're
                  still welcome. let's catch some
                  air before the bell rings.
