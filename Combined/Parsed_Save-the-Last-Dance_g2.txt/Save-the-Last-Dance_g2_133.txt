177   int. hotel ballroom - senior prom - night                       177

      over slow music (possible theme song):

      sara (in a gown) and patrick (in a tux). dancing (as if
      they had danced from the last frame into this one). they
      are beautiful.

      wider to reveal the entire dance floor...

      and we see that it's the senior prom.

      the room's dressed up like a dreamy, futuristic romantic
      illusion. the ceiling's ablaze with tiny, star-like
      lights; under them large poufs of cotton clouds hang.
      glittering, mirrored balls dangle over the main floor.

      seniors dance in traditional and cutting edge tuxes and
      mouth-watering, eye-popping versions of dresses and
      gowns. camera pans the floor, picking up:

      a surprisingly dashing snookie and the fly girl. as they
      dance, he bravely but rather too abruptly dips her...

      diggy (in a glitter tuxedo and spiked hair) and her
      date...

      nikki with whom we shall perceive to be the howard
      university guy. in any event, he looks slightly bored.

      chenille with kenny, smiles at sara as she and patrick
      dance by.

      camera favors and pushes in on...

      sara and patrick. gazing at each other.     the song ends
      with them in each other's arms.
