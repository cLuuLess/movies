     int. feetz - fight - patrick and malakai

     a thick crowd around them, proceed to beat the living
     shit out of the two dealers.


     angle on sara and chenille

     wrangling their way to the front line of the crowd, diggy
     not far behind them. sara looks on, dumbfounded and
     dazzled by what she sees, which is --


     patrick

     pummeling his dealer into cowering submission. only then
     does he look over at malakai who, eyes engorged with
     rage, is standing over his opponent, kicking and stomping
     him with no signs of letting up. patrick can see
     malakai's too far gone for talk. he rushes him from
     behind, nearly lifts malakai off his feet to swing him
     away from the dealer's writhing body on the floor.
