124   ext. inner harbor complex   (downtown baltimore) - day         124

      sara and patrick negotiate the heavy pedestrian traffic,
      exit the complex. he leads her to a mall of trees and
      bike paths.

                              patrick
               lemme see that move you did.     that
               cute leg relieve thing.
                      (as she shakes
                       her head)
               come on, sara.

                             sara
                      (hates to admit this)
               it hurts! i'm out of shape and it
               hurts. okay? satisfied?

                              patrick
                       (admiring her)
                that's what you call outta shape,
                what's it take to get you in
                shape?

                                sara
                practice.

                              patrick
                this is the perfect spot for that.
                you can run around and i can sit
                under the trees and watch you.

                              sara
                i don't get in shape like that.
                but it's still a good spot.
                       (diffidently)
                i got my application for
                juilliard. just in time too.
                they're holding auditions in
                baltimore next month.

                                patrick
                that's great!

      she looks at him, shakes her head.   not that great.

                              sara
                i'll never be ready in a month.

                              patrick
                sara, you puttin' the mojo on
                yourself.

                                                   (continued)

                                                                77.

                                  sara
                           (a smile in spite of
                            herself)
                   mojo?

                              patrick
                negative shit. white folks call
                it karma. the bad kind.

                              sara
                you don't understand. ballet
                takes a lot of time, a lot of
                preparation. i used to practice
                two, three hours every day. i'm
                so far behind...

      ... and unsure and afraid. which patrick can sense.        but
      he won't let her go there or stay there. he's firm,
      matter-of-fact.

                              patrick
                quit whinin' and catch up then.

                              sara
                it's not as easy as that. my free
                form still sucks. it's still the
                weakest part of my routine. that
                hasn't changed.

                                 patrick
                   so i'll help you with it.

                                  sara
                   you will?

                                 patrick
                          (surprised that she's
                           surprised)
                   yeah. i'll help you. tell me
                   what you need to do and let's get
                   busy.
