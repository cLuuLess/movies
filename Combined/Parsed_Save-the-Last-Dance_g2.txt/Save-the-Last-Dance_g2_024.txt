35   int./ext. roy's pickup (south baltimore) -                     35
     next morning

     roy and sara. barreling through the south end, tongues
     stuck in gear. a pop-tart grows cold on sara's lap.
     then, finally.

                                sara
                  i can take the school bus.
                  tomorrow.

                               roy
                  school bus? that's the other oz,
                  dorothy. patterson kids ride the
                  city metro. or walk.

                                                     (continued)

                                                             13.

35   continued:                                                     35

                                sara
                  well, i know how to do both.

                                roy
                  not around here you don't. not
                  until you get the hang of things.

     sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. it's
     all to obvious, the hang of things. roy glances over at
     her.

                                roy
                  i called about your transcripts.
                  you're all set. patterson's got a
                  pretty good humanities program.
                  no ballet, but we can find a
                  studio someplace close for after
                  school --

                             sara
               -- i don't think i'll have time.
               i have to study, i'll be busy.

     roy can hear the lie behind her words.      the pain too. he
     lights a cigarette, cracks the window.      he wants to say
     the right thing.

                             roy
               good idea. take a break. not too
               long a break though. you're a
               dancer. you should dance. stay
               on top of your art.

                             sara
               like you stay on top of yours?

                             roy
               maybe i ain't playin' no grand
               ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals,
               but i'm playing.

                             sara
                      (unconvincingly)
               i didn't mean it like that.

                                roy
                  s'alright. hell, i wish i had
                  half the time i wasted gettin'
                  wasted. but those days are over.
                  you'll see. i got my life on
                  track.

                                                            14.
