168   ext. playground - swings - chenille and kenny - later            168

      they're side by side on swings. christopher's nestled
      against kenny's chest, soundly snoozing. they slowly
      swing throughout.

                                 kenny
                   it cut me, what you said.

                                 chenille
                          (means this)
                   i shouldn't have... i was
                   trippin'.

                                 kenny
                   you always trip. i'm used to
                   that. besides, you were right.
                   you were wrong, too. so was i. i
                   need to do better. ain't no doubt
                   about that.

                                 chenille
                   i know i come down on you hard
                   about money, but i would rather
                   you spend the time. seriously.

                             kenny
                      (jokingly)
               so you don't want any money?

                             chenille
               i didn't say all that.

      he smiles. gently rubs christopher's brow.          looks at
      her. chenille smiles at him.

                                 kenny
                   i love my son, chenille.    you know
                   that, don't you?

                                  chenille
                   yeah.   i always knew that.
