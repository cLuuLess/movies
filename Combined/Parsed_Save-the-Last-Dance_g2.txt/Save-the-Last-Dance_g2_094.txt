138   int. rib joint (somewhere in baltimore) - night                   138


      malakai, along with snookie and two brain donors, arvel
      and lip, eat at a booth. patrick strolls in gritty from
      work. tired from work. he slides in next to malakai.
      the mood is light, jovial.

                                 arvel
                   you smell, boy.

                                 patrick
                   how can a piece of shit tell?

      the table cracks up.

                                 malakai
                   you been scarce lately, man.
                   where you been?

                                 arvel
                   somewhere dreamin' of a white
                   christmas...

                                 lip
                   ... and christmas ain't even for
                   'nother six months.

                                 snookie
                   lip. it's a so-to-speak thang,
                   you ignorant fuck.
                                 (more)

                                  snookie (cont'd)
                           (looks at patrick)
                   so.   so to speak? whassup.

                                 patrick
                          (snatching up one of
                           his ribs)
                   back out my business, boy.

                                 malakai
                          (watching patrick
                           keenly)
                   you tappin' that white girl, man?
                          (half joking)
                   that's why you ain't got time for
                   your boyz no more, you too busy
                   frontin'. too busy snowflakin'.

      patrick lifts one of malakai's ribs, responds coolly.

                              patrick
                how am i frontin', 'kai? i made
                time for this bullshit, didn't i?

                              lip
                aww, man. you busted. that's why
                your jaws are gettin' so tight.

                              snookie
                you the one need his jaws
                tightened with your pork-ass
                instigatin' self.

                              arvel
                       (re: patrick's roving
                        fingers)
                order somethin', patrick. this
                ain't no goddamn soup line.

      patrick grabs some of arvel's fries, chews them in his
      face.

                                 patrick
                   y'all hangin' tonight or what?

                                 malakai
                   we thinkin' about slidin' through
                   that new rec center opened up on
                   the eastside. you ridin'?

                                  patrick
                   eastside?   that's the wrong side.
                                  (more)

                                 patrick (cont'd)
                   i ain't messin' with those fools
                   over there. you know how they
                   are.

                                 malakai
                   i ain't pressed. i got my own
                   shit.

      shorthand. the table stops. malakai glances around,
      lifts his shirt to expose a gun. patrick stares at
      malakai with disbelief.

                             malakai
               what you think? i'ma keep walkin'
               around waitin' for some chump to
               cap me? i'ma protect myself.

                             patrick
               that ain't protection. it's an
               excuse for some unnecessary
               mayhem.

                             malakai
               ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout
               it. shit. mayhem and madness.
               that's a black man's life.

                             patrick
               how you know? you ain't tried
               nothing else. now you sittin' up
               here strapped for no good reason.
               you askin' for trouble, malakai.
                      (as malakai laughs)
               you think this shit's funny?

      snookie shifts uncomfortably. arvel and lip look at
      malakai. malakai looks at patrick, coldly drops his
      smile.

                                 malakai
                   i think it's funny you think it
                   ain't necessary. you act like you
                   don't know where you are no more,
                   patrick, and whassup out there for
                   anybody who ain't you. maybe
                   that's what happens when a white
                   girl goes to your head.

                                 lip
                   -- or gives you some.

                                                      (continued)

                                  patrick
                   fuck you, lip.
                          (looks at malakai)
                   i know what's out there. i also
                   know you can get past it. but
                   that ain't gonna happen, 'kai,
                   long as you keep gettin' in your
                   own way.

                                 arvel
                          (peacemaker)
                   aw'ight. y'all said what you had
                   to say. we back to bein' boyz.
                   patrick. chill. have some ribs.
