84   ext. street (o'donnell heights) - night                      84

     sara, patrick and chenille. walking home. chenille's
     preaching to patrick. he's not in the mood.

                              chenille
                ... yeah, i'ma tell you. tell you
                like i keep tellin' you, patrick.
                you need to let malakai alone.
                let him handle his own shit before
                he drags you down in it.

                              patrick
                chenille. i heard you the first
                five hundred times.

     they round a corner bordering the heights. stop in front
     of it. chenille, disconcerted with patrick, looks dourly
     at sara.

                               chenille
                i'll see you monday.
                       (to patrick, like an
                        order)
                he'll walk you.

     as much as this makes sense, it still takes patrick by
     surprise. sara sees it in his face, regards chenille
     with a false bravado.

                              sara
                it's just a few blocks.   it's
                okay.

                              chenille
                no, it's not okay. would you tell
                the girl it ain't okay?

                              patrick
                it's not okay, okay?
                       (before she can
                        protest)
                come on, braveheart.
