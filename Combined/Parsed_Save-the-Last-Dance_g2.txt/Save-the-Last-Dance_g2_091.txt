135   int. roy's rowhouse - hallway/front door - that night           135

      sara unlocks the door. she and patrick enter. she turns
      on the lights. looks at him. answers the unspoken
      question.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                   82.

135   continued:                                                         135

                                 sara
                   he's in d.c. blues alley.   he'll
                   be gone all night.

      patrick sits down on the sofa. sara crosses to the
      stereo, turns it on. a sax solo begins playing.

                                sara
                   roy's demo. the only one he ever
                   cut. kinda grows on you.

      a beat.   somewhere between five seconds and forever.
      then:

                                 sara
                   wanna see my room?

      patrick looks at her, nods. he gets up, follows sara
      behind the partition into her "room." they stand there
      for a moment. he cups her face with his hands. kisses
      her. they begin to take off each other's clothes,
      alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit
      urgent. sara unzips patrick's pants, catches something
      other than his clothes. patrick winces in pain. she
      looks at him with an embarrassed grimace. says this very
      low.

                                 sara
                   sorry...

      they kiss again, stumble backward to her futon.       fall
      down upon it and begin to make love.
