      dressed to the nines. they look happy and relaxed, more
      so than we've ever seen. they sit close to each other.
      very close.

                                 sara
                   are you gonna tell me where we're
                   going?
                          (as he grins, shakes
                           his head)
                   why is the surprise for me?
                   you're the one with something to
                   celebrate.

                                 patrick
                   we can celebrate together.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                   71.

      she looks at him. can't find any words. so she just
      goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box. she
      hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be
      received.

                             sara
               i wanted to get you something and
               i couldn't figure out what. it's
               not much but i hope you like it.

      patrick opens the box. removes a key chain. it's
      engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.).
      he regards her, touched.

                                  patrick
                   i like it.   i love it.    thank you.

                                 sara
                wait.     there's more.

      she leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. the
      back side of it is engraved with the words, "patrick
      reynolds, m.d." patrick locks eyes with sara, lifts her
      hand to his lips. kisses it softly. the gesture is
      succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're
      the only two people in the world.
