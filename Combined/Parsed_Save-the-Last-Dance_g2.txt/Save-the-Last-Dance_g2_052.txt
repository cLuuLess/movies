78   int. feetz club - continuous action                            78

     a smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids.
     mostly black kids with a few whites and latinos melting
     in. they share a common goal: to clog the dance floor,
     flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the
     masters: tupac shakur, nas, lauryn hill, puff daddy,
     etc. here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed,
     from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious.


     another angle

     sara and chenille. sara's excited. she loves that she
     has to shout to be head over the music.

                                chenille
                  let's get our table 'fore it gets
                  crashed and i hafta hurt somebody.

     sara's bewildered. she doesn't see any tables. she
     follows chenille to the back of feetz. sees six or seven
     tables. all of them have reserved signs. most of them
     are filled.

                                sara
                  what are you, some kind of v.i.p.?

     chenille indicates the deejay booth.     snookie's in it.

                             chenille
               snook hooks me up whenever he
               dees.

     they walk past a slacker in lycra pants and a big army
     shirt. he licks his tongue at chenille, grabs at her
     protruding butt. she swirls around, grabs his crotch
     hard enough to get his attention. the slacker is
     squirming in her clutch.

                             slacker
               aw'right, aw'right. you got it.

                               chenille
               got what?
                               (more)

                                                    (continued)

                                                                39.

                                chenille (cont'd)
                         (as he can't think of
                          anything but the
                          squeeze on his balls)
                  the right to walk past your
                  greasy, tickle dick self without
                  your paws on my ass? 's'that how
                  i got it?

     chenille bobs her head right in his face. sara can't
     believe it. a few people have stopped and are looking.
     the slacker nods hastily. chenille releases him, gently
     smoothes out his shirt.

                                 chenille
                  that's how i thought i had it.
                          (a fly wave)
                  see ya.

     she and sara continue on to back-of-the-club tables.
     stop at a reserved one. an adjacent table sports nikki,
     her three girl crew... and diggy. all nurse drinks.
     nikki snake-eyes sara.

                            nikki
              what is up with this place? seems
              like they're lettin' anybody in.

                                 chenille
                  yeah.   and they started with you.

     the three girls and diggy snicker. nikki gives chenille
     a look. turns back to sara with a snide smirk. points
     out her crew.

                               nikki
                  i'm nikki. alyssa. jasmin.
                  tiff'nee. you know diggy, right,
                  marsha?

                                sara
                  sara. it's sara. and i know you.
                  we have a class together.

                                nikki
                  that don't mean you know me.

                                chenille
                  quit it, nikki.

                                nikki
                  quit what? i ain't walkin' on
                  eggshells just 'cause you brought
                  the brady bunch to the negro club.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               40.

78   continued:                                                       78

                                sara
                         (kiss-my-ass polite)
                  maybe you came to the wrong spot,
                  nikki. i'm pretty sure this one
                  doesn't have any negroes.

     chenille cracks up mainly to back sara up.       nikki glowers
     at her.

                                nikki
                  i'm pretty sure you came with one.

                                chenille
                  oh, no. uh-uh, wench. you did
                  not just call me a negro.

     as chenille bucks, diggy springs up from her seat, runs
     her arm in the space between chenille and nikki like a
     referee.

                             diggy
               alright, y'all. chill.

                                nikki
                  tell her to chill. she always got
                  somethin' to say.

                            chenille
              i can say a lot more. keep
              runnin' your mouth, nikki. i'll
              lay all your shit bare.

     whatever shit it is, nikki's not taking any       chances. she
     ejects herself from the table, walks off.        the three
     girls scoot loyally after her. diggy gets        up. sits down
     at sara's and chenille's table. diggy goes        with the
     flow. that's why she always fits in.

                                diggy
                  why you burn her like that?

                                chenille
                  'cause i can't stand her ass and
                  the way she played my brother. i
                  need a drink, sara. let's walk.
