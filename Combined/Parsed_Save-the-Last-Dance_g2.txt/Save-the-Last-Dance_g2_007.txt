11   int./ext. flower van (driving)/residential streets           11

     sara and glynn. the back of the van is filled with
     flower arrangements. glynn takes note of the roses in
     sara's hand.

                             glynn
               where'd you get those, traitor?

                             sara
               ellison -- mr. ellison. he
               actually told me to break a leg.

                             glynn
               roses from the principal, even
               droopy, out-of-season yellow ones,
               is beyond cool, kiddo. you're
               definitely movin' up in the world.

     sara looks through the windshield.   it's starting to
     drizzle.

                             sara
               know what would be great? if you
               didn't drop me off at the bus
               station. if we just kept going
               until we get to philly.

                             glynn
               ruin everyone's valentine's day
               and not have a shop when i get
               back. that's your definition of
               great? i can see the headline
               now: 'starving artist kills unfit
               mother.'
                      (gently)
               sweetheart, we talked about this.
               i'll get there as soon as i can.

     sara looks at her and glynn instantly feels guilty.

                             sara
               right. this is the hardest, most
               important day of my life and all
               you can do is get there as soon as
               you can. thanks, mom.
