167   ext. playground (o'donnell heights park) - day                  167

      groups of children scatter around worn-out playground
      equipment. the gleeful squeal of them is everywhere.
      patrick guides christopher down a slide; chenille catches
      him at the bottom. christopher can't get enough of this
      ride and patrick and chenille repeat the routine
      throughout their conversation.

                                 chenille
                   why you so quiet?
                          (off patrick's
                           brooding look)
                   patrick reynolds ain't got nothin'
                   to say? that's a first.
                          (catches her son
                           with a whee!; then)
                   you know how i go off on folks
                   sometimes. i mean it and then i
                   don't mean it. like what i said
                   to sara. guess she told you.

                                 patrick
                          (monotone)
                   i don't care what you said,
                   chenille.

                                 chenille
                   patrick. your ass is on your back
                   and your lips are on the ground.
                   you care, baby brother. and not
                   just about what i said.
                          (as he looks at her)
                   you seriously like sara. she got
                   a serious jones for you. am i
                   lyin'?

                                                      (continued)

                                                                111.

167   continued:                                                       167

                                 patrick
                   it's besides the point. whatever
                   point it is you tryin' to make.

                              chenille
                i'm sayin' you can't help who you
                love, patrick. at least you found
                somebody who loves you back.

      patrick regards chenille impassively.    hands christopher
      to her.

                                patrick
                i gotta go.

                              chenille
                to where? to who? malakai?
                       (sucks her teeth)
                you ain't through with that fool
                yet.

                              patrick
                he's not a fool, chenille.

                              chenille
                no. you know what? you're the
                fool, patrick. you think you let
                malakai down and all you did was
                try to pull yourself up. ain't no
                blame or shame in that.

                                 patrick
                          (very low; a broken smile)
                   i still gotta go. check you
                   later.

      holding christopher, chenille watches patrick walk out of
      the playground. disappear. she and christopher move on
      to a seesaw. chenille bobs him up and down on one end of
      it. she's snuggling in christopher's face when the other
      end suddenly drops to the ground. chenille looks up.
      sees kenny.
