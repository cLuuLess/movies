     sara with a bunch of c.d.'s. she juggles them in one
     hand, flips through hip-hop c.d.'s with another. she
     looks up to see patrick standing beside her. he takes in
     the c.d.'s. grins at her.

                                patrick
                  throwin' a party?

     there's no wiggle room but sara wiggles anyway.

                                sara
                  just adding to my collection. i
                  heard some stuff i didn't have
                  last night.

                                patrick
                         (that twinkle in his
                          eyes)
                  well, you were fly anyway. last
                  night. dancin', i mean.

                                sara
                  not as fly as you.

                                patrick
                         (half-serious)
                  nobody's as fly as me.

                                                     (continued)

                                                                53.

88   continued:                                                       88

                                sara
                         (dead-serious)
                  not yet anyway.

     patrick laughs. looks at her.        sara looks back at him.
     they're staring at each other.

                                patrick
                  maybe we could hook up later.
                  after school or somethin'. work
                  on some of your moves. if you
                  want.

                                  sara
                  okay.   sure.

     patrick nods affirmatively. starts to leave.       turns
     back, indicates her stack of c.d.'s.

                                patrick
                  by the way, hammer's pretty much
                  played out.

                                sara
                         (convincing lie)
                  not to me.
