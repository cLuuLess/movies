69   int. roy's apartment - sara's room - night                   69

     roy walks in to see sara on the futon in her pajamas
     reading a book. she's got a head full of rollers.

                              roy
               i'm splittin'.
                      (as she barely looks up)
               whatcha readin'?

                              sara
               chemistry.

                             roy
               you're takin' chemistry?

                             sara
               right now it's taking me.

                             roy
               give yourself some time. well.
               see ya in the mornin'. maybe i'll
               call between sets.

     sara really looks up.   gives him an angelic, sluggish
     shrug.

                             sara
               i'll be asleep.

     he leaves. as soon as sara hears the front door close,
     she jumps up, strips down to bra and panties, races to
     the closet. one hand rips the rollers from her hair, the
     other rips through outfits. she's frantic and unsure
     about choosing the right one.
