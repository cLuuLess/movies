121   ext. street (somewhere in baltimore) - night                   121

      post-ballet, sara and patrick walk. she's quiet,
      introspective. patrick's at a loss. he can't decipher
      her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.

                              patrick
                i thought you would like it.

                              sara
                i did.

                              patrick
                you ain't actin' like you did.

      she looks over at him, tries to smile.

                              sara
                i'm sorry.

      they come to a small, secluded bridge.     sara sits down on
      the edge of it. patrick follows suit.      a long moment.

                              sara
                i don't want you to think i didn't
                have a good time tonight, patrick.
                i did. but ballet isn't a part of
                my life anymore.

                              patrick
                why not? what happened? you just
                woke up one day and decided to
                waste your talent.

                              sara
                       (without rancor)
                how do you know i have talent?
                because i did some stupid leg
                trick.

                              patrick
                i saw the look on your face when
                you did it, sara. the same look i
                saw tonight. goofy happy. so if
                you're gonna tell me somethin'
                about not dancing, at least tell
                me somethin' real.

      a long, difficult moment wherein sara attempts to find
      the words, face the pain that comes with them. finally,
      she looks at him.

                              sara
                maybe i don't want it to be real.

                                                    (continued)

                                                              74.

      she stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of
      it. it's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil
      she's feeling. but she goes on.

                              sara
                what i want is to wake up and see
                my mom. for things to go back to
                the way they were. when they made
                sense. when my life made sense.
                       (because)
                and it's all my fault. she got
                scraped off the highway for me,
                for my fucking audition. she was
                rushing. it was raining. it was
                raining...
                       (a torrent)
                ... but she promised to be there.
                i made her promise. and then i
                didn't wait for her. i should
                have but they called my name and i
                didn't say anything. i just went
                out and danced. i was mad. i
                needed her and she wasn't there.

      she buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked
      with tears and guilt. patrick puts his arms around her.

                              sara
                       (inconsolable)
                she was dying while i was dancing
                and i was mad at her and i'm
                sorry. i'm sorry...

                              patrick
                it's not your fault it rained or
                she died. or that you danced.
                that's what you were there for.
                your mom would've expected you to
                do what you did.

      sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly.

                              sara
                that's what makes it so bad. she
                always did what was right for me.
                i wanted to be a prima ballerina
                -- had to be. even if it took
                most of our money, all of her
                spare time. i didn't care. it
                was my stupid dream and it killed
                her. all she wanted was for it to
                come true.

                                                    (continued)

                                                           75.

                                 patrick
                   you still got whatever you had
                   when your mom was alive, sara.
                   she wouldn't want you to give up.

      sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying.

                                 sara
                   i know... but she... i just don't
                   think i can do it without her.

                                 patrick
                          (holding her)
                   do you want to do it, sara? i
                   mean you. do you want juilliard?

                                   sara
                   yeah.   i do.

                                 patrick
                   then it's on you to make the dream
                   come true.

                                  sara
                   yeah.   for my mom.

                                  patrick
                   for her.   for you.
