174   ext. street                                                       174

      patrick heads down the street. as he walks, he can hear
      the sound of gunfire behind him, and then the sound like
      an explosion. a car horn goes off in a persistent drone.
      patrick stops. stands there for a moment. then he's
      walking again. without looking back. and then he's
      running away from the mayhem behind him.
