176   ext. caguan town dock - day                                    176

      the panga arrives, and gordy gets out. he's met by
      felix. felix has a 9mm in a shoulder holster. felix
      doesn't look the least bit happy.

                                felix
                beckmann.

                                gordy
                yeah.

                                felix
                come with me.

      felix leads him towards a land cruiser.

                              felix
                armstrong should have called
                sooner. we don't like changes
                here... if i didn't need the
                equipment fixed, i'd send you
                back.

                                                    (continued)

                                                                67.

176   continued:                                                      176

      they reach the land cruiser.

                                 felix
                   but now we have to see the e.l.c.
                   supervisor for caguan.

      it's a prospect that seems to concern felix almost as
      much as gordy. off which, as they get into the toyota...
