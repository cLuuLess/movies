      the two guerrillas are just driving away in a big-
      wheeled, high ground-clearance suburban as gordy and
      felix emerge. felix is weaving.

      gordy keeps his eyes on the suburban's tail lights and
      opens the land cruiser's passenger door for felix.

                                 gordy
                   you're too drunk. i'll drive.
