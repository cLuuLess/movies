129   ext. mompos ferry dock - day                                129

      gordy disembarks amid the throng of passengers, when the
      fat federale confronts him.

                              fat federale
                senor pitt?

      gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale
      backing him up.

                              fat federale
                you'll have to come with us.

                              gordy
                why?

                              fat federale
                come with us, please.

      he clamps a hand on gordy's arm. gordy shakes it off and
      starts running. almost immediately, he's tackled to the
      ground by the thin federale. two more federales join in.

      gordy's not gonna go down easy, though.

      even as only one against four, gordy's a formidable
      challenge. he's strong, and he's committed all the way.
      he's not getting kicked out of this country again. it's
      not a clean or artful fight. there's no karate. it's
      four men trying to tackle a bull, and...

      the bull gets away.
