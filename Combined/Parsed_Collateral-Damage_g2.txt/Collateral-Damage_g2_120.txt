      the blackhawks, black and menacing, sit on an illuminated
      tarmac as:

      heavily armed troops in black uniforms and assault vests
      load up.

      door gunners check mini-guns.

      ground crews yank arming ribbons on rocket pods.

      a co-pilot in a specially rigged helmet tests his forward
      mini-gun: wherever he looks, the gun points.

      pilots finish checklists, and...

      chopper engines start whining. rotors begin to turn.
      the noise mounts to an incredible roar.


282   angle - l.o.h.                                                  282

      the small helicopter's rotors are also turning. brandt
      stands at the chopper door with updegraf. slams the
      magazine on a glock .45, making sure it's in solid, then
      slides the pistol into his shoulder holster. he checks
      his watch. loud, to updegraf --

                                 brandt
                   it's time to make the wolf howl.

      he takes a last drag on his cigarette, passes the butt to
      updegraf to finish and gets in the rear of the l.o.h. as
      updegraf scoots clear.


283   l.o.h.                                                          283

      throttles up and screams away.


284   blackhawks                                                      284

      one by one in quick succession, lift off the deck and
      follow the l.o.h. into the night sky.

                                                               103.
