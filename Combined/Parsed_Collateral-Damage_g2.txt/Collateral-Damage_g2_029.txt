67   int. ipc office - night                                         67

     gordy smashes office equipment left and right. ortiz-
     dominguez and rosetta cower as gordy vents his pent-up,
     end-of-the-world rage using the bat the way we saw him
     use a fire axe.

     gordy approaches ortiz-dominguez with the bat.      backs him
     up against a desk.

                                ortiz-dominguez
                please...

     the fbi agents crash in.

                                fbi surveillance agent
                mr. pitt!

     gordy just stares down at ortiz-dominguez.

                              fbi surveillance agent
                this isn't the way to do things.

     gordy still doesn't move.

                              fbi surveillance agent
                these guys're only mouthpieces.

     beat.   then gordy swings the bat.   hard.   and...

     destroys the computer monitor next to ortiz-dominguez.

     gordy tosses the bat aside.    to the shaking latin --

                              gordy
                how's that for collateral damage?
