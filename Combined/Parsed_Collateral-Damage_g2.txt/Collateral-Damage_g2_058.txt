      gordy sprints down streets with the federales in pursuit.

                                                               55.

131   gordy                                                          131

      jukes into a local bar.


132   another angle                                                  132

      gordy pounds out the back of the bar into a littered
      courtyard, where he's surrounded by ten-foot walls.


133   federales                                                      133

      blast through the bar.


134   gordy                                                          134

      runs, jumps, launches off a beer keg, and...


135   top of wall                                                    135

      he reaches the top of the wall and pulls himself up.
      he's looking out across a block-long run of corrugated
      tin roofs. takes off across the roofs, each step
      thundering, as...


136   federales                                                      136

      burst into the courtyard. two men hastily build a stack
      of boxes, etc., against the wall.


137   gordy                                                          137

      runs as fast as he can across the rooftops, when...

      a section of roof gives way beneath his feet, just as...


138   new angle                                                      138

      one of the federales finally mounts the wall, looks
      across the rooftops... and gordy's gone.


139   gordy                                                          139

      lands inside a warehouse room amid sacks of rice, beans
      and coffee. the building is dark and dusty. he lies
      still and listens. footsteps approach across the tin
      roof overhead. gordy burrows into the bags of rice,
      pulls them over him.

                                                              56.

140   federale                                                      140

      on the roof peers down through the hole. scans the
      warehouse room below with a mini-mag-lite.


141   gordy                                                         141

      sees the flashlight beam move past. he holds his breath.
      beat. then the footsteps pass on, recede down the roof.
      and gordy can breathe again.
