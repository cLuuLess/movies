221   ext. plantation                                                    221

      wham-wham-wham, one of the diesels gordy repaired suffers
      a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. the heat lights
      dim in a row of sheds. felix and the guerrillas stop to
      see what's happening. at which point, the generator now
      bursts into flames.


222   back to gordy                                                      222

      he smiles.

                                 gordy
                   just in time...

      and we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as...

      the water jet breaks through.      the hole's still small.
      gordy begins to widen it.

                                                              84.
