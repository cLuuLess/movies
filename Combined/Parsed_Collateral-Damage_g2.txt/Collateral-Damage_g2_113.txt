       updegraf highlights a map for brandt, who thinks aloud --

                                  brandt
                    it's well-sited... can't surprise
                    'em, so you gotta outgun 'em...
                           (beat)
                    so that's what we're gonna do.

                                  updegraf
                    we're gonna hit it?

                                  brandt
                    we're not just gonna hit it, we're
                    gonna wipe if off the globe.
                    cats, rats, dogs and mice. if
                    it's moving, it's dead.

                                  updegraf
                    hitting the whole village could
                    make for a p.r. problem.

                                 brandt
                   i don't care what the puerto
                   ricans say.
                          (then, off updegraf's
                           look)
                   which part of the word 'war' don't
                   you understand? our mission down
                   here isn't just about catching the
                   wolf.

                                 updegraf
                   ... what about gordy pitt?

                                 brandt
                   he was told not to be here... the
                   first choppers'll hit it at 2200.
