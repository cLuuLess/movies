     gordy talks to a latin reporter, ernie orosco.

                             orosco
               you interested in the big picture
               or all the unpleasant details?

                             gordy
               my family died because of what's
               going on down there. i want to
               know all i can.

     orosco searches for a starting point.   then --

                             orosco
               well, basically, the situation in
               colombia sucks...

     as orosco continues...

     over the course of a week:

     1. gordy takes pictures, etc., off a wall in his home.
     he pins up photos of anne and matt at the top of the
     wall. beneath them he pins up a large map of colombia.

                             orosco (v.o.)
               ... the government's been fighting
               different marxists factions for
               over thirty-five years. for most
               of that time, it was winning...

     2. at the new york public library, gordy uses microfilm
     files and computer access to the web to search out
     information on colombia and the wolf.

                             orosco (v.o.)
               ... suddenly the guerrillas began
               chopping 'em up. high-tech
               weapons and equipment, well-
               trained troops, aggressive hit-
               and-run tactics, all financed by
               extortion, kidnapping and
               collecting taxes from dope
               growers. it's big money, and they
               put it to use...

                                                              28.

72   gordy                                                          72

     3. gordy pins up various colombia-related articles and
     pictures on the wall, including the surveillance camera still of
     the wolf from the front page of the new york post.

                              orosco (v.o.)
                ... the government got scared. in
                1998, to jump start peace talks,
                it gave a coalition of guerrilla
                groups temporary control over much
                of southern colombia... the first
                communist stronghold on an
                american continent...


73   gordy                                                          73

     4.   gordy draws a line around the guerrilla zone.

                              orosco (v.o.)
                ... but there've been few talks
                and no peace. and the colombian
                military can't get near the
                guerrilla zone, especially around
                the town of caguan, where the
                e.l.c. kicks ass and takes no
                prisoners...


74   gordy                                                          74

     5.   gordy circles and labels the elc-controlled area.

                              orosco (v.o.)
                ... and that's where we come in.
                supposedly, to help eliminate
                narcos operating in the guerrilla
                zone. but some well-informed
                people think that's just an excuse
                to hit the guerrillas themselves,
                since they're wrapped around the
                drug trade... we're there, we're
                involved... if we stay, the only
                real question is which vietnam war
                we're gonna have. the one some
                feel we could've won or the one we
                lost...


75   gordy                                                          75

     6. gordy watches a documentary about colombia which
     shows rebels, army troops, death squads, firefights, and with
     atrocities and bodies on both sides.

                                                     (continued)

                                                                  29.

75   continued:                                                         75

                                orosco (v.o.)
                  ... bottom line? the place is as
                  dangerous as a snakepit. you've
                  got the different guerrilla groups,
                  c.i.a., f.b.i., d.e.a., colombian
                  military, u.s. military, right-
                  wing death squads -- and the only
                  thing they've all managed to do is
                  destroy a beautiful country and
                  inflict suffering on the real
                  people... hey, i'm colombian, and
                  i'll never go back...

     off gordy's packed wall...


76   same scene - another day                                           76

     as gordy closes the front door, reveal mike, the
     firefighter, who's just come in and now stands staring at
     the wall, clearly whelmed by the level of compulsion this
     must have required.

                                mike
                  haven't heard from you in a couple
                  days.

                                 gordy
                  been busy.

                                 mike
                  yeah.   i can see that.

     gordy's obsessed, totally consumed by his project.      he
     points at a picture of heavily-armed guerrillas.

                                gordy
                  e.l.c. attack platoon... these
                  assholes kill innocent people all
                  the time in colombia.

     gordy indicates a newspaper article.

                                 gordy
                  thirteen dead in a bus.
                          (indicates another)
                  a market. twenty-seven dead.
                          (another)
                  a whole family... anne and matt
                  didn't mean shit to them.
                          (indicates the wolf)
                  or him.

     mike interrupts, trying to divert him to something else.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                    30.

76   continued:                                                           76

                                mike
                  hey, we never turned down free
                  beer, and rookie's buying, you
                  believe that? he certified today,
                  he's off probation.

                                gordy
                         (still looking at
                          wall)
                  ronnie couldn't find a fire with
                  both hands.

                                 mike
                          (smiles)
                  yeah.   let's go tell him that.

     gordy doesn't react.     beat.      more serious now --

                                  mike
                  c'mon, gordo.

     gordy hears the tone. looks over and meets mike's eyes,
     seeing the genuine concern there.

                                mike
                  we aren't gonna let 'em drink all
                  the beer, are we?

     off gordy...
