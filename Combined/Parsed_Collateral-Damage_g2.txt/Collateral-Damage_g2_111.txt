265   int. underground bunker - night                                      265

      gordy's still in a deep fog from the beating, barely
      there at all.

                                 gordy
                   ... who are you?

                                 selena
                   my name is selena.

                                   gordy
                   ... his wife?

                                   selena
                   yes.


      beat. the sea shells clack. gordy loses consciousness
      again, and everything goes...


266   black                                                                266

      the clacking sound continues.         and...


267   gordy's pov                                                          267

      this time, when gordy opens his eyes, there's no
      blurriness. it's a new day. he's better. selena's
      walking to him with a tray. the shell bracelet clacks as
      she approaches.

                                 selena
                   i brought you food.
