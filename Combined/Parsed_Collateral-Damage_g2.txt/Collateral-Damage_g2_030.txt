     gordy sits across from phipps.    dray is present.

                              phipps
                mr. ortiz-dominguez has agreed not
                to press charges if you make full
                restitution.

                              gordy
                i've already paid. with my
                family.

     beat.   phipps sees it's pointless to insist.   to dray --

                              phipps
                take care of it.

     dray heads out, passing mike brandt, who enters.

                                phipps
                  gordy, this is mike brandt.

                                brandt
                  mr. pitt.

     gordy just looks at him.

                                brandt
                  i'm very sorry for your loss... i
                  lost people, too.

                                phipps
                  ... mike was in the motorcade that
                  day... he's the chief u.s.
                  intelligence officer overseeing
                  colombia.

                                brandt
                  don't worry, mr. pitt, we're gonna
                  get the son-of-a-bitch.

                                gordy
                  you know where he is?

                                brandt
                  we believe the wolf's in hiding
                  in an area of colombia controlled
                  by the e.l.c., extreme marxist
                  guerrillas... he thinks he's in
                  a safe haven.

     brandt lets "thinks" sink in.

                                phipps
                  i know it's hard for you right
                  now, mr. pitt. we're all sorry.
                  but why don't you go home.
                  we're taking care of things.

     beat.   brandt proffers a business card.

                                brandt
                  here's my card. call me any time.

     gordy takes it.    just sits there a long moment, then --

                                gordy
                  what kind of twisted people do
                  things like this?

     beat.   brandt and phipps don't have an answer.

                                                          27.
