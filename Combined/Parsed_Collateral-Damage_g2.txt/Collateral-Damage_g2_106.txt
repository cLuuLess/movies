      gordy's gone. the beaten man signals two men to go out
      the hole. to the other man --

                              beaten man
                       (in spanish)
                organize the others. find him.

      the man goes. outside, we hear him shout orders to the
      guerrillas guarding the plantation. the beaten man turns
      to felix. felix is terrified. in a pleading tone --

                              felix
                       (in spanish)
                he can't be far. you'll catch --

      bang! the beaten man shoots felix in the head. then
      exits. off felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water
      still streaming across the floor...
