       - day

       phipps flips to the last photo in the book.

                                  selena
                 ... no...

       he reaches for another book. as he does, he topples a
       stack. selena's eyes fix on one book cover.

                               selena
                 he had that book! let me see it!

       phipps hands it to her. it's a guidebook to washington.
       selena flips through it. stops at a photo.


338    close on photo                                                       338

       it's of the redesigned lobby of union station.


339    back to scene                                                        339

       selena glances up.

                                  selena
                 that's it!

                                  brandt
                 union station.

                                phipps
                        (to dray)
                 put it under total surveillance.
                 get a bomb team in there with
                 dogs. make 'em seeing-eye dogs if
                 you have to. and pull whatever
                 security video they have for the
                 last two days.

                               dray
                 why not just shut it down?

                               phipps
                 if we spook him, we don't know
                 what his secondary target'll be.

       dray gets on the horn.   beat.      to brandt and phipps --

                               selena
                 please don't kill him.

                                                              117.
