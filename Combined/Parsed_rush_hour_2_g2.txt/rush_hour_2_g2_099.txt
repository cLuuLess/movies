	int. casino - continuous

	on his back, lee watches the detonator sail over his head and
	disappear into the crowd.  it lands on a drink cart.  before
	lee can get there, a waitress changes trays and carries the
	detonator on her rounds.

	panicked, lee searches for the detonator.  he jumps atop a
	blackjack table to get a better vantage.  he can't see it,
	but he does see:

	across the casino

	carter on top of a craps table, keeping security guards at
	bay with a croupier stick.

				carter
		black man gets on a hot streak and
		you're all trippin'?

	carter and lee see each other.  they have the same
	simultaneous though:

				carter (cont'd)
			(help!)
		lee!

				lee
			(help!)
		mmmmmm!!!!

	carter is lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. 
	but from here to there, a mass of people.  the quickest way
	is the high way.

	lee leaps from table to table.  scattering playing cards. 
	reaching the carpeted divide...lee doesn't stop. 
	he launches off the bent-over back of a high roller --
	landing on a rickshaw, surfing it to the tables on the other
	side.

	carter looks around for lee, catches a glimpse of the eye in
	the sky room.  he grins.

				carter
		check it out.  catfight!

	pow!  he socks a guard in the face.
