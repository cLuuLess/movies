	carter struts through the lobby, lee doing his best to
	imitate carter's pimp and roll.  they walk past the giant
	buddha --

		buddha is the symbol of luck and good
		fortune.

		buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy.

	they are moving through the main entry hall lined with terra
	cotta chinese soldiers - posed and dressed for battle.

	rickshaws and bicycles take people through the hotel.  the
	main casino is roped off and empty.  people crowded around
	the perimeter - a sign reads:

				sign
		$50,000 buy in -- everybody's a winner!

	the lights dim - a spotlight comes on and finds steven reign
	on the balcony overlooking the entrance.

				steven reign
		a thousand years ago, a small, wealthy
		village in china hired a young dragon to
		guard their treasure in a cave, hoping
		to scare off potential bandits.  their
		plan worked quite well, until the people
		of the village started sneaking the
		dragon extra food -- hoping to make him
		bigger and stronger.  the dragon ate so
		much and grew so big -- that he
		eventually got stuck inside the cave --
		and the treasure was stuck behind him
		for all eternity.
			(beat)
		ladies and gentlemen, i have found that
		lost treasure.  it is here, inside the
		greatest casino in the world!  welcome
		to the red dragon, where everybody is a
		winner!

	reign smiles, flips a switch -- the casino comes to life. 
	fireworks, bright lights, endless rows of tables, dealers
	waiting.

	a band plays on a stage in the casino lounge.

	chinese acrobats perform suspended from the ceiling and on
	the balconies above.

	applause all around as the flame shoots out of the dragon's
	nostrils and the acrobats perform.  carter and lee walk down
	the red carpet.
