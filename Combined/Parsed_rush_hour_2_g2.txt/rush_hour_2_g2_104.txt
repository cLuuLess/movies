	int. casino - night

	whoosh!  another terra cotta fighting stick is in half in
	carter's hands.

				carter
		will you stop?!?!
			(picks up cocktail umbrella)
		what am i supposed to fight you with?

	no more toying.  hu li charges carter, who grabs a roulette
	wheel as a makeshift shield.  she slices it in half!  he's
	got nowhere to hide.

	she jabs him with the sword.  carter screams.  falls back
	against the table, clutching his chest.  hu li windmills,
	kicking a terra cotta soldier on top of carter, but --

	thwack!

	the double-bladed bamboo pole in its hand ricochets back and
	she is pierced through the shoulder with the blade.  staring
	at carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees.

	carter walks toward her, considers his options, then kicks
	her in the head, knocking her out.

				carter (cont'd)
		when are you people gonna learn?  don't
		mess with the brothas!

	weak in the knees, carter looks to the sound on his chest. he
	reaches through the slice in his jacket.  instead of a hand
	covered in blood, it comes out with a thick wad of cash!

				carter (cont'd)
		thank you, benjamin!

	carter runs for the elevator.
