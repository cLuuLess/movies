	int. dance floor - night

	lee is dancing close with isabella.

				isabella
		the secret service almost busted reign
		at his casino in macao, but the place
		burned down before we could move in.

				lee
		how do i know i can trust you?

				isabella
		dip me!

	lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long beat.

				isabella (cont'd)
		i'm asking for real now -- will you help
		the secret service?

				lee
		no.
			(beat)
		but i'll help you.

	lee holds her for a long beat, their lips almost touching. 
	he finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. 
	carter walks up, sees lee standing alone on the dance floor.

				carter
		lee, what the hell are you doing?

				lee
		dancing?

				carter
		dancing?  i'm out here trying to strong
		arm steven reign, putting my life on the
		line, and you're up here dancing with
		some bimbo.  did she have a friend?

				lee
		it was isabella.  she says the plates
		are in the soft count room.

	lee motions to the room, where we see a security guard
	standing in front of a small door.

				carter
		isabella?  are you crazy, man?  she
		almost got us killed.  she's setting you
		up again!

				lee
		no.  i'm going to find out.

				carter
		wait a second.  there's guards all over
		the place.  you'll need a distraction.

	carter looks around the casino.

				carter (cont'd)
		i'll go to the craps table, make a big
		scene.  when security comes over, you
		make your move.  

				lee
		try to keep them busy for five minutes.

				carter
		i'll give it my best shot.
