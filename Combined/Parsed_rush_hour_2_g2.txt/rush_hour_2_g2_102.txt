	int. elevator bank - night

	lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  suddenly, a hand
	cuts through, parting the doors.

	it's isabella!  a wound on her shoulder.

				lee
		are you okay?

				isabella
		i'm fine.

	she steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  lee grabs her and
	holds her in his arms.  he gently helps her down.

				lee
		i didn't know which side you were on.

				isabella
		now you know.

	ding!  the elevator doors open.  isabella holds up a room key
	- the key to the suite.  lee takes the key, backs away and
	steps into the elevator.

				isabella (cont'd)
		i'll try to get backup.  be careful.

	the elevator doors close.
