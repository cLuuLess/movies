	ext. monastery school - early morning

	lee and carter walk into a massive courtyard, where thirty 12
	year olds are going through their warm up routines.  

	master fu, 60's, wears a black robe as he teaches his kids.

				carter
		i'm telling you right now, i'm tired of
		this shit.  there's two billion chinese -
		let one of them be your partner.

				lee
		this won't take long. 

	master fu barks out a barrage of shaolin fighting stances.

				master fu
		dragon kick!

	like well-trained army, the students yell and kick hard.

				master fu (cont'd)
		lotus block!

	the students yell and form an "x" with their arms.  master fu
	notices carter and lee watching from the back.

				master fu (cont'd)
		twisting tiger!

	no response.  the students exchange baffled looks.

				master fu (cont'd (cont'd)
			(staring straight at lee)
		twisting tiger!

	lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move
	that leaves the students blown away.  lee smiles, basking in
	the glow...

	...until he sees master fu's disappointment.

				master fu (cont'd)
		didn't i teach you to always arch your
		back?

				lee
			(bowing, humbled)
		yes, master.

	while lee follows master fu, carter stands in front of the 12
	year olds, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 

	carter starts stretching his legs, warming up.

				carter
		i was watching you kids.  my name is
		carter, lapd, and i'm a third degree
		black belt.  at least that's what i tell
		the girls at the holiday health spa
		where i work out.

	carter throws a series of quick punches, but the kids have no
	reaction.

				carter (cont'd)
		let me give you kids some tips.  the key
		to kung fu is the follow through.  why
		don't you stand up.

	the kids don't move, no reaction.  carter continues to throw
	punches.

				carter (cont'd)
		go ahead, kick me, hit me.  i'll show
		you how to block.  come on, stand up,
		give me your best shot -- try to kick
		right to my head.

	the kids still don't move.  carter, working up a sweat from
	shadow fighting, takes off his jacket, draping it over the
	holy buddha behind him -- a mistake.  he swings back around
	to face the kids and never sees the kick that sends him
	flying back onto the mat.  he looks around and sees all of
	the kids standing, in fighting position.

				carter (cont'd)
		that's pretty good.  which one of you
		kids did that?
