	int. hong kong police station - bullpen - day

	pandemonium

	the station is packed with americans -- fbi agents, secret
	service... they've set up shop right in the middle of the
	bullpen.

	superindendent chin is arguing with special agent sterling, a
	50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus.

				special agent sterling
		chin, you have been ordered by the
		ministry of public security to assist
		the fbi and secret service with our
		investigation, to provide us with
		whatever we need.  if you have
		information, it belongs to us.

				superindendent chin
		this is still hong kong.

				special agent sterling
		two americans have been killed on united
		states government property -- this is
		our investigation.

				superindendent chin
		chief inspector lee will brief your
		people...

				special agent sterling
		no.  he will report to me.  do we
		understand each other?

	suddenly all eyes turn as carter and lee enter the bullpen. 
	out of breath, still robed: lee covering himself with a trash
	can lid, carter using a red construction cone.

				special agent sterling (cont'd)
		who the hell is that?

				superindendent chin
			(humiliated)
		that is...chief inspector lee.  the
		detective in charge of our
		investigation.

				special agent sterling
		put a diaper on him, chin.  i want to
		talk to the great inspector lee.
