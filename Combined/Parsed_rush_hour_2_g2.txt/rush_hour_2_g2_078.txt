	ext. las vegas blvd. - dusk

	the blvd.'s packed with people and cars.  

	close on

	lee and carter coming up from the manhole -- standing
	together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the las
	vegas strip.  they cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest
	light show in the world.

		lee.  i just got an idea how someone
		could launder a hundred million dollars
		in cash.

	they both turn around and come face to face with:

	a ten-story dragon.  fire shoots from its nostrils every 60
	seconds.
