173   ext. cliffs of hellespont - night                           173

      a trojan rider on horseback trots south, away from distant
      troy. he looks toward the hellespont. something catches
      his eye. he frowns and guides his mount toward the
      cliff's edge.
      we rise above him and look down at the hellespont. by the
      light of the moon, nearly one thousand greek warships
      harbor in the deserted bay.
      the rider stares at the ships in horror.
