7    ext. ionian sea - dusk                                           7

     we're high above the wine-dark sea, gliding north. soon
     the peloponnesian coast comes into view. the only break
     in the shoreline is the inlet of laconia, and we follow it
     inland.

     the inlet ends in a natural harbor where several tall-
     masted warships are beached, sails unfurled, oars locked
     and rowing benches empty. dozens of smaller fishing boats
     are scattered about the harbor.

     on top of the highest hill, overlooking all sparta, stands
     a thick-walled palace. torch-bearing sentries, wearing
     plumed helmets and carrying long spears, man their posts.

                                menelaus (v.o.)

                  princes of troy, on our last night
                  together, queen helen and i salute
                  you.
