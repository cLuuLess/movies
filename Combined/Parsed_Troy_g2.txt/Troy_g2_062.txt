63   int. temple of apollo - day                                 63




     hector and his men enter the temple. eyes adjusting to
     the gloomy light, they gingerly advance. all is quiet.
     evidence of looting is everywhere.



     at the back of the temple, stairs lead up to the altar
     room. hector walks toward the stairs. blood trickles
     down the steps. hector raises his eyes.
     achilles stands atop the staircase, both hands wrapped
     around the hilt of his sword, the sword point resting on
     the top step. he stares down at hector.
     war cries explode through the temple. the myrmidons burst
     from their hiding places and rush the trojans.
     hector is an obvious target.   two myrmidons charge him,
     their spears leveled.
     if achilles is the apotheosis of martial grace, hector is
     something altogether different -- a man of ordinary gifts
     who has become an extraordinary warrior by dint of
     experience, endless training, and powerful intelligence.
     as the myrmidons charge he waits. at the last moment he
     swings his sword, slicing both spearheads from their
     shafts. the myrmidons stare at their decapitated spears.
     hector doesn't give them a chance to recover. he pounces,
     sword flashing, and both men fall to the temple floor.
     achilles watches from the top step. hector begins running
     up the stairs. achilles disappears inside the altar room.
     another myrmidon bounds up the stairs after hector. the
     prince wheels about and kicks the myrmidon in the
     breastplate. the soldier tumbles down the steps. hector
     continues up the stairs.
