      hector lunges forward and from our angle it appears that he
      has skewered achilles. hector's face is inches from achilles.
      achilles appears unperturbed. hector looks down.
      achilles has trapped him, allowing hector's sword to miss
      his side by inches and then clamping down on hector's
      sword arm. hector tries to yank his sword free but
      cannot.
      achilles stabs at hector's face and hector ducks at the
      last moment, the sword point puncturing the air above his
      head. achilles releases hector and takes another mighty
      swing.
