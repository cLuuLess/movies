      something hardens in paris's face. whatever callowness
      we've seen before seems to ebb away as he watches achilles

      horror.

      andromache sits against the wall, knees tucked against her
      chest, face against her knees. scamandrius begins to cry.
      helen kneels by andromache. she picks up the baby and
      soothes him. helen takes andromache's hand. andromache
      looks up. her eyes are a terrible thing to see.

                                 helen

      andromache allows helen to pull her to her feet. helen,
      holding the baby in one arm, guides andromache away.
