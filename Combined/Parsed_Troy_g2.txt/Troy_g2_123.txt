124   int. palace of troy - subterranean level - night               124

      andromache follows hector into the palace's dark recesses.

                                 andromache

                   where are you taking me?
      hector leads her until they reach a bronze-banded oak
      door. he opens the door, revealing the mouth of a dark
      tunnel.

                                 hector

                   you remember how to get here?

                                 andromache

                   yes.

                                 hector

                   next time you come, follow this
                   tunnel. there's nowhere to turn,
                   so you can't get lost. keep
                   walking.

                                 andromache

                   hector --

                                  hector

                   when you get outside you'll be on
                   the south side of the scamander
                   river. follow the river till you
                   see mount ida. keep ida to your
                   west, walk south, and you'll get to
                   lyrnessus.
                           (beat)
                   the greeks won't go that far
                   inland.

                                 andromache

                   you're frightening me.
      hector stares into the darkness of the tunnel.

                                 andromache

                   hector.
                           (beat)
                   why are you telling me this?

                                 hector

                   if i die --

                                 andromache

                   no --

                                 hector

                   if i die, i don't know how long the
                   city will stand.

                                 andromache

                   don't say that.

                                 hector

                   if the greeks get inside the walls,
                   it's over. they'll kill all the
                   men. doesn't matter how old,
                   they'll pull grandfathers from
                   their beds and carve their lungs
                   out.

                                 andromache

                   please   --

                                 hector

                   doesn't matter how young. they'll
                   throw the babies from the city
                   walls.
      andromache closes her eyes.

                                 hector

                   the women they'll take for slaves.
                   and that will be worse for you than
                   dying.

                                 andromache

                   why are you saying these things?

                                  hector

                   i want you to be ready. i want you
                   to get our boy, get him, and come
                   here. save as many others as you
                   can, but you get here, you go down
                   these stairs, and you run.
                           (beat)
                   do you understand?
      she nods. the flickering flame of the taper throws giant
      shadows on the stone walls.

                                  hector

                   i killed a boy today.
                           (beat)
                   he was too young. much too young.
