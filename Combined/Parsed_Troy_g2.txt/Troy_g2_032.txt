      the sun rises above troy and the trojan countryside.

      dozens of supplicants kneel before the statue of poseidon
      and lay down their offerings: bundles of flowers; small
      carvings; goatskins filled with wine.

      prepare    a series of fortifications at the   beach. men
      carrying    torches ignite giant pumice urns   filled with
      burning    pitch. others hammer long spikes    deep into the
      sand to    hinder enemies rushing up from the   beach.
      there is little conversation and the men look tense.
      everything is touched with an air of extreme urgency.

      two priests carve strips of fat from a roasted pig and lay
      them on the god's altar, muttering chants as they perform
      the ritual.
      briseis, the temple acolyte, stands beside the priests,
      pouring ceremonial wine on the stone floor.
