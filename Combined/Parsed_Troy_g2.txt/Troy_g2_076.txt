77   ext. palace garden - night                                   77

     priam's gardens are wondrous: palm trees grow in the
     courtyard; flowered vines climb the walls; aeolian harps
     chime in the breeze.
     priam and paris sitting on a bench, facing a statue of
     aphrodite. the king holds a cloth-wrapped bundle in his
     lap.

                                paris

                  father, i... i'm sorry for the pain
                  i've caused you. i --

                                priam

                  do you love her?
     paris looks up at the statue of aphrodite.

                                 paris

                  you're a great king because you
                  love your country so much. every
                  blade of grass, every grain of
                  sand, every rock in the river --
                  you love all of troy.
                          (beat)
                  that's the way i love helen.
     priam nods and contemplates the goddess of beauty.

                                 priam

                  i've fought many wars in my time.
                  some were fought for land, some for
                  power, some for glory.
                          (beat)
                  i suppose fighting for love makes
                  more sense than all the rest.
     paris says nothing, but his father's words seem to relieve
     a great burden from his shoulders.

                                priam

                  but i won't be the one fighting.
     he hands paris the bundle. paris, curious, begins
     unwrapping the cloth. finally the object is uncovered: a
     shining sword, expertly forged, inscribed with the seal of
     troy.

                             paris

               the sword of troy.

                                 priam

                  my father carried this sword, and
                  his father before him, all the way
                  back to the founding of troy. the
                  history of our people was written
                  with this sword.
                          (beat)
                  carry it with you tomorrow.
     paris holds the sword up and it glows in the moonlight.

                                priam

                  the spirit of troy is in that
                  sword. as long as a trojan carries
                  it, our people have a future.
