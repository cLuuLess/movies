11   int. helen's chamber - night (later)                         11

     helen lies naked on her bed. in the candlelight her
     flanks are mapped with copper trails of sweat. she
     watches paris, who stands bedside pulling on his clothes.

                             paris

               i have something for you.
     from his tunic he pulls a necklace of baby pearls threaded
     with silver. he sits beside her in bed.

                             paris

               pearls from the sea of propontis.
     paris strings the pearls around her neck.

                              helen

               they're beautiful.
                       (beat)
               but i can't wear them.    menelaus
               would kill us both.

                             paris

               don't be afraid of him.

                             helen

               i'm not afraid of dying. i'm
               afraid of tomorrow, watching you
               sail away and knowing you'll never
               come back.
     she runs her fingers across his jaw line.

                             helen

               before you came to sparta i was a
               ghost. i walked and i ate and i
               swam in the sea, but i was a ghost.

                                                    (continued)





                                                              15.

                                paris

                  you don't have to fear tomorrow.
     helen watches him, unsure what he means.




                                  paris

                  come with me.
     for a long moment they stare into each other's eyes.

                                helen

                  don't play with me, prince of troy.
                  don't play.
     the sounds of footsteps and laughter outside the door
     startle them. paris halfway unsheathes a knife hanging
     from his belt.
     whoever's walking by the door passes without stopping.
     paris sheathes his knife, kneels beside the bed and takes
     her hand.

                                 paris

                  if you come we'll never  be safe.
                  men will hunt us and the  gods will
                  curse us. but i'll love   you.
                  until the day they burn  my body i
                  will love you.
     helen stares into paris' eyes, contemplating the
     impossible.
