104    ext. battlefield - later                                       104

       thousands of bodies litter the broad field. we see them
       first from high above, their bronze armor gleaming in the
       failing sunlight. close on several of the dead men's
       faces.
       the living haul the dead from the battlefield.       horses
       are used to pull wagonloads of bodies.
       fathers or sons or brothers or friends say their goodbyes
       and wash the dead men with washcloths and buckets of
       water.
       the sun sinks into the ocean. both sides build funeral
       pyres for their fallen. when a body is loaded onto the
       pyre, a relative or friend places two coins on the dead
       man's eyes.
       dozens of salamisians view ajax's body. they weep as they
       pass by, each man kneeling to kiss their fallen king's
       hand.

       he places two coins on menelaus's eyes. he steps down
       from the pyre, accepts a torch from a captain, and sets
       the pyre on fire.




                                  agamemnon

                    i will burn their city before i
                    leave, brother. i promise you
                    that.
       as the sky grows dark, the dead burn on the beach and
       inside the walls of troy.
