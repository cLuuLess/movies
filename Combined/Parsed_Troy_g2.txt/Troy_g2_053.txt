     achilles, three arrows in his shield, sprints across the
     sands. arrows tear through the air about him. no man
     alive can run with achilles.

      he leaps over the fortification, sword flashing before his
      feet ever touch the ground. the archers crumple to the
      ground as achilles' sword cuts through them.



      in a moment the myrmidons catch up to achilles and lay
      into the archers. within seconds they massacre them.
      achilles turns and nods to the temple: the next target.
      eudorus gasps for air. achilles regards him with
      amusement.

                                 achilles

                   breathe, my friend.
      eudorus takes two deep breaths. achilles dashes for the
      temple. his myrmidons follow behind.

      the archers at the temple unleash a fusillade of arrows.
      every few yards another myrmidon falls. several of them
      are wounded, but if they're not dead they keep moving
      forward.
