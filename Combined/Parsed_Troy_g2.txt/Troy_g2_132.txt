133   ext. walls of troy - day                                     133

      the crowds start to fill the viewing areas above the city
      walls.
      priam and his counselors sit below the blue canopy.
      paris sits near them, but not with them. he doesn't look
      at anybody and people are careful to avoid looking at him.
      hector stands alone at one of the wall's turreted corners,
      staring toward the sea.
