8    int. palace of sparta - reception hall - continuous              8

     menelaus (40), king of sparta, stands at the head of a
     massive table that spans the length of a hall lit by
     torches. a battle-scarred warrior, menelaus is already
     halfway drunk.

     beside menelaus sits his wife, helen (25), wearing a white
     gown, head bowed, half listening to her husband. fresh
     flowers are woven into her hair. her beauty is so extreme
     she seems to exist in a separate realm.

    the only woman in the room and the only one wearing white,
    helen shines amidst the unwashed warriors of sparta and
    troy. all sit at a table laden with platters of roasted
    game birds, whole fish, octopi, suckling pigs and bowls of
    fruit.

    menelaus holds his gold wine goblet in the air, toasting
    his honored guests, hector (35) and paris (25).
    hector is not the best-looking man in the room, nor the
    largest, but the intensity of his expression, the regality
    of his bearing, confirms that he is a born leader.
    paris is the best-looking man in the room, by a long shot.
    he's not paying attention to menelaus. he's staring at
    helen.

                               menelaus

                 we've had our conflicts before,
                 it's true. we've fought many
                 battles, sparta and troy. and
                 fought well!

    menelaus's soldiers cheer drunkenly.    for a moment helen
    looks up and meets paris's gaze.

                               menelaus

                 but i've always respected your
                 father. priam is a good man, a
                 good king. i respected him as an
                 adversary, and i respect him now as
                 my ally.

    more cheering, this time from the entire assembly.

                               menelaus

                 hector, paris, young princes, come,
                 stand, drink with me.
    hector stands. paris does not. he's still staring at
    helen. hector nudges his brother's shoulder. paris
    stands.

                               menelaus

                 let us drink to peace.
    hector nods to menelaus and raises his cup.

                               hector

                 peace between troy and sparta.

                                                   (continued)





                                                           11.

    the king and the princes drink deeply and slam their empty
    cups to the table.

                               menelaus

                 may the gods keep the wolves in the
                 hills and the women in our beds.
    all the men in the hall cheer and rise to their feet.

                                guests

                 to sparta!   to troy!
    
    a band of musicians strike up their instruments; servants
    roam the hall filling goblets with wine.

    polydora (20), one of helen's handmaidens, leads a dozen
    attractive young women into the banquet hall.

    the warriors howl at the sight of the women. soon each of
    the handmaidens is flanked by drunken soldiers.

    menelaus grabs hector in a bear hug. hector gamely
    accepts the embrace. when the king releases him, both men
    spill a few drops of wine from their cups onto the floor.



    they drink the rest of their wine. menelaus grips
    hector's upper arm. servants refill the cups.

                               menelaus

                 a strong arm. thank the gods we
                 made peace -- i've seen too many of
                 my men struck down with this arm.

                               hector

                 never again, i hope.

                               menelaus

                 only one man works a sword better
                 than you. the son of peleus the
                 argonaut.

                               hector

                 achilles.

                               menelaus

                 that madman would throw a spear at
                 zeus himself if the god insulted
                 him.

                                                  (continued)





                                                           12.

    menelaus indicates polydora, who stares at hector openly.

                               menelaus

                 you see that one over there? i
                 picked her just for you. she's a
                 little lioness.
    menelaus grins at the girl, who lowers her eyes and
    smiles. helen notices this silent exchange but ignores
    it, conversing instead with another handmaiden who sits
    beside her.

                                hector

                 thank you.   my wife waits for me in
                 troy.

                               menelaus

                 my wife waits for me right there.
    he leans forward to whisper conspiratorially in hector's
    ear.

                               menelaus

                 wives are for breeding. you
                 understand? for making little
                 princes. come, enjoy yourself
                 tonight.
    helen stands and walks out of the reception hall.
    menelaus does not notice. hector does. he raises his cup
    to menelaus.

                               hector

                 you make excellent wine in sparta.
    menelaus laughs and drinks with hector.
    paris excuses himself from the spartan generals he's been
    speaking with and heads outside -- in the same direction
    as helen. hector watches with mounting agitation.
