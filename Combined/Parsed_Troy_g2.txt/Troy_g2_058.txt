59   ext. temple of apollo - continuous                             59

     achilles, not even breathing hard after the slaughter,
     removes his helmet and rests it on the wall. the
     surviving myrmidons search the grounds, dispatching any
     dying trojans.
     eudorus hurries over to achilles' side.

                                eudorus

                  the temple is secure.

                                achilles

                  the sun god is the patron of troy,
                  our enemy. take whatever treasure
                  you can find.
     the myrmidons cheer and rush the temple.

                                eudorus

                  with your permission, my lord --

                                achilles

                  speak.
     eudorus gestures to the sun above them.

                                eudorus

                  apollo sees everything. perhaps
                  it's not wise to offend him.

     achilles nods and walks over to the towering statue of
     apollo in front of the temple.
     eudorus watches in horror as achilles climbs atop the
     statue and beheads apollo with a swing of his sword.
