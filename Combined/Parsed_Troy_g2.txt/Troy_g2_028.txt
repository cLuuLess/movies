28   ext. troy - day                                               28

     hector, paris, helen, and an entourage of soldiers walk
     through the gates of troy.
     the city is magnificent, a wonder of white-washed walls,
     lush gardens, and towering statues of the gods. zeus,
     apollo, aphrodite, and poseidon stand eighty feet high in
     the four corners of the main square.
     the princes' return is a holiday for the trojans.
     thousands of onlookers line the road, cheering. other
     well-wishers, standing on the roofs of houses, throw
     flower petals.
     paris holds helen's hand and occasionally whispers in her
     ear, pointing out various sights, but helen looks nervous.
     people in the crowd, mystified by her appearance, point at
     her and whisper amongst themselves.
     helen holds her head high and pretends to ignore the
     murmurs and stares. hector looks at her. she carries
     herself like a queen -- but she's gripping paris's hand
     with white knuckles.
