88    ext. walls of troy - day                                   88

      helen, alone, views the battlefield. an old, spotted hand
      takes her elbow. she turns and looks into priam's eyes.

                                   priam

                   sit with me.
      helen follows the king to his grandstand and sits beside
      him. she's aware of people staring at them but he seems
      oblivious.

                                 priam

                   all my life i've prayed against
                   this day.

                                   helen

                   yes, my king.

                                 priam

                   call me father, dear child.
      startled by this affection, she hesitates before
      responding.

                                 helen

                   forgive me, father.     for...
      she pauses, staring out at the vast greek army.

                                 helen

                   ...bringing this.
      priam shakes his head and smiles sadly.

                                  priam

                   i blame you for nothing.
                   everything is in the hands of the
                   gods.
                           (beat)
                   besides, how could i blame anyone
                   for falling in love with paris?
      helen looks out at the battlefield, fixing on paris, at
      this distance a tiny figure on horseback. priam takes
      her hand.




                                                         81.
