9   int. helen's chamber - night                                 9

    the room is lit by a dozen tall candles. helen removes
    the flowers from her hair and drops them into a bowl of
    water. she hears a sound and looks up. paris stands in
    the doorway.
    for several breaths they are silent, staring at each
    other.

                                                  (continued)





                                                        13.

                               helen

                 you shouldn't be here.
    paris closes the door behind him.




                               paris

                 that's what you said last night.

                               helen

                 last night was a mistake.

                               paris

                 and the night before?
    helen continues removing the flowers from her hair but she
    cannot hide a half-smile.

                               helen

                 i've made many mistakes this week.
    he approaches her.

                               paris

                 do you want me to go?
    his hands are on her now, sliding down her bare neck, down
    her back, resting on her hips. his mouth is very close to
    her ear. helen closes her eyes.

                               helen

                         (whispering)
                 yes.
    paris kisses her neck, her ears, her closed eyes. the
    tightness we saw in her face when she sat by her husband's
    side is gone, replaced by ecstasy.

                               paris

                         (whispering)
                 where should i go?
    she kisses him back now and there's a hunger in her
    kisses, something close to violence in her desire. she
    lifts off his tunic and pulls him nearer.

                                helen

                          (whispering)
                 away.   far away.
    in a moment the white gown slips to her feet. he stares
    at her naked body in wonder. he opens his mouth to speak
    but she kisses him full on the lips. they sink onto the
    bed.




                                                            14.
