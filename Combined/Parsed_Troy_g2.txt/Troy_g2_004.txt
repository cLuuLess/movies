4    int. achilles' tent - continuous                             4

     the boy pauses for a moment inside the tent, eyes
     adjusting to the dim light. evidently last night was a
     wild party. jugs of wine are everywhere, and the remains
     of a large feast.

     sleeping on a fur rug are two naked women and one naked
     man, tanned arms and legs entwined. the boy sidesteps
     shards of a broken jug. he bends to tap the sleeping
     man's shoulder.

     before his fingers make contact, a hand shoots out, grabs
     his wrist, and pulls him to the rug. the boy finds
     himself flat on his back with a dagger to his throat.

                              achilles

                 shh.
    the boy stares into the eyes of achilles (30), who seems
    to have barely moved. somehow he managed to seize the boy
    and put a knife to his throat without waking the women.

                                achilles

                         (whispering)
                 i was having a good dream.
                         (beat)
                 a very good dream.
    the boy nods, dumb with fear. achilles has the lean,
    efficient physique of a boxer. his face and body are dark
    from a summer spent in the sun.

                               boy

                 king agamemnon sent me.    he
                 needs --

                               achilles

                 i'll speak with your king in the
                 morning.

                               boy

                 but my lord -- it is morning.
    achilles frowns. he stands and walks naked to the tent
    flap, holds it open and stares at the empty encampment.

                               boy

                 they're waiting for you.
