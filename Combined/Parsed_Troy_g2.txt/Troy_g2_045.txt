46   ext. gates of troy - day                                        46

     hector and tecton gallop through the gate. they rein in
     their horses and look over the elite apollonian guard,
     eighty of troy's finest soldiers, riding well-groomed,
     snorting mounts.
     when hector speaks his voice is clear and steady.

                                 hector

                  all my life i've lived by a code,
                  and the code is simple.
                          (beat)
                  honor the gods.
                          (beat)
                  love your woman.
                          (beat)
                  and defend your country.
     the men roar.

                                hector

                  troy is mother to us all.   fight
                  for her!
     the men roar and thrust their spears into the air.        hector
     leads the charge to the beach.
