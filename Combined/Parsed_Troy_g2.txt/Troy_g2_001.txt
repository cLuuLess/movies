1    ext. thessalian valley - day                                1

     a mangy, bone-thin dog lopes across the broad valley
     floor, sniffing at the ground.   at first the scene
     appears bucolic: tall grass, patches of wildflowers, blue
     sky above.

     but as the dog keeps running we see signs of conflict. a
     spear, half imbedded in the earth, rises at an angle. a
     bronze helmet, cracked and bloodied, lies on its side.
     the dog pauses to sniff the helmet then continues his
     search. finally he stops, hackles on his back rising,
     ears pricked up. he growls, and we see what the dog sees.
     dozens of crows have descended into a shallow ravine.
     they squabble and peck, clustered around something on the
     ground.

     the dog growls louder and charges at the crows. the black
     birds flap away to safety, shrieking in protest.
     a dead soldier lies facedown in the ravine. whatever
     armor he wore was stripped away, leaving his body to the
     elements.

     the dog walks slowly to the dead man, sniffing at the
     corpse's hands. the dog whines and licks the man's
     fingers.

     something in the air disturbs the dog, who looks up. and
     now we hear it, faintly, in the distance. hoof beats and
     chariot wheels, marching men, the clank of bronze armor
     and weaponry.

     the dog runs, abandoning his dead master.




1a   the mycenaean army                                          1a

     five thousand strong, storms into the valley from the
     south. armored with bronze breastplates, helmets and
     shields, the soldiers glitter in the morning sun.
     riding alongside the infantry are dozens of horse-drawn
     chariots, each holding a driver, a spearman and an

     officer.

     on the opposite side of the valley, three thousand
     thessalonian soldiers march into view. the thessalonians
     are less disciplined, their armor and weaponry less
     impressive.

                                                 (continued)





                                                             2.





1a   continued:                                                   1a




     when each army reaches the battlefield they stop and stare
     one another down, two hundred yards distant.







1b   a mycenaean chariot and a thessalonia chariot                1b

     emerge from their respective sides and meet at the center
     of the field.

     agamemnon, king of the mycenaeans, rides in his chariot
     with a driver and a spearman. agamemnon holds a gold
     scepter, symbol of command. his breast plate is engraved
     with an alpha.

     his counterpart in the thessalonian cart, triopas (60),
     does not project equal confidence. he eyes the size of
     the mycenaean army with evident unease. he holds his own

     scepter.

     both kings step down from their chariots and approach each
     other. they stare at one another for several seconds.
     agamemnon smiles and looks into the sky.
     the crows wheel overhead, cawing.

                                agamemnon

                  it's a good day for the crows.

                                triopas

                  i told you yesterday and i'll tell
                  you again today. remove your army
                  from my land.
     agamemnon smiles again and turns to examine the valley.

                                 agamemnon

                  i like your land. i think we'll
                  stay.
                          (beat)
                  i like your soldiers, too. they
                  fought bravely yesterday. not
                  well, but bravely.

                                triopas

                  they'll never fight for you.

                                agamemnon

                  that's what the messenians said,
                  too. and the arcadians. and the
                  epeians.   they're all fighting for
                  me, now.

                                                    (continued)





                                                              3.





1b   continued:                                                     1b





                                triopas

                  you can't rule the whole world,
                  agamemnon. it's too big. even for
                  you.



     agamemnon surveys triopas's army.

                                 agamemnon

                  i don't want to watch another
                  massacre. let's end this war in
                  the old manner.
                          (beat)
                  your best fighter against my best.
     for the first time, triopas looks hopeful.

                                triopas

                  and if my man wins?

                                 agamemnon

                  we'll leave thessaly for good.
                          (beat)
                  i'm a generous man. if mine wins,
                  you keep your throne. but thessaly
                  falls under my command, to fight
                  with me whenever i call.
     triopas considers before nodding.     he shouts to his army.

                                triopas

                  boagrius!
     the thessalonians murmur and step aside. a giant emerges
     from their midst, boagrius, a foot taller than the other
     men, his face gouged with old knife scars. he marches out
     to his king.

                                triopas

                  here is my champion.
     agamemnon raises his eyebrows as the giant comes closer.

                                agamemnon

                          (shouting to his army)
                  achilles!
     the mycenaeans murmur amongst themselves, looking for
     achilles. nobody emerges. agamemnon frowns.

                                triopas

                  boagrius has this effect on many
                  heroes.

                                                     (continued)





                                                             4.





1b   continued:    (2)                                            1b





                                agamemnon

                  be careful whom you insult, old
                  king.



     an officer on horseback gallops from the mycenaean ranks
     to the center of the field. he bows his head to
     agamemnon.

                                officer

                  achilles is not with the army.
     triopas laughs and looks up at boagrius, who chuckles.

                                agamemnon

                          (furious)
                  where is he?

                                officer

                  i sent a boy to look for him.
