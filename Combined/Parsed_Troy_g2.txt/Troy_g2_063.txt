     as more greek ships make landfall, the apollonian officer
     sees that their position is no longer defensible.

               back to the city! back to the
               city!
     the trojans begin to retreat. the archers still turn to
     fire whenever there's time. mounted guards haul fleeing
     archers onto their horses.
