32   int. paris's bedchamber - night                                 32

     paris paces about the room. helen stands in the archway
     looking out to the dark sea. the wind blows through her
     hair.

                                 helen

                  they're coming for me.
                          (beat)
                  the wind is bringing them closer.
     paris stops pacing and stares at her.

                                paris

                  what if we left? tonight, right
                  now, what if we went down to the
                  stables, took two horses and left.
                  ride east, keep riding --

                                  helen

                  and go where?

                                paris

                  away from here. i could hunt deer,
                  rabbit. i could feed us.

                                helen

                  this is your home --

                                paris

                  you left your home for me.

                                helen

                  sparta was never my home. my
                  parents sent me there when i was
                  sixteen to marry menelaus, but it
                  was never my home.
     paris, excited with his new-hatched plan, barely listens.

                                paris

                  we'll live off the land. no more
                  palaces for us, no more servants.
                  we don't need any of that.

                                helen

                  and your family?

                                paris

                  we'd be protecting my family! if
                  we're not here there's no need for
                  a war.

                                helen

                  menelaus won't give up. he'll
                  track us to the end of the world.

                                paris

                  he doesn't know these lands. i do.
                  we can lose ourselves in a day.
     helen stands and kisses him on the lips.

                                helen

                  you don't know menelaus. you don't
                  know his brother. they'll burn
                  every house in troy to find us.
                  they'll never believe we've left --
                  and even if they do, they'll burn
                  troy for spite.
     paris considers her words and finally nods.

                                paris

                  then i'll make it easy for him to
                  find me. i'll walk right up to him
                  and tell him you're mine.
     helen wraps her arms around paris and rests her chin on
     his shoulder.

                                helen

                  you're very young, my love.

                                                   (continued)

                                 paris

                   we're the same age!

                                 helen

                   you're younger than i ever was.
