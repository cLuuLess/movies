40   ext. achilles' warship                                       40




     achilles' oarsmen holler encouragement to their shipmates
     and check to see that their boat is safely in the lead.
     achilles stands in the prow, scanning the trojan shore.
     patroclus stands beside him. eudorus (40), a myrmidon
     lieutenant, approaches achilles.

                             eudorus

               should we wait for the others?
     achilles marks the progress of the other ships.      the
     nearest is a quarter-mile back.
     those myrmidons (achilles' countrymen and comrades) not
     rowing are suiting up for battle.

                             achilles

               they brought us here for a war,
               didn't they?

                                eudorus

               yes, my lord.     but agamemnon --
     achilles stares at his officer until the man bows his
     head.

                             achilles

               do you fight for me, eudorus?     or
               agamemnon?

                             eudorus

               for you, my lord.

                             achilles

               then fight for me. and let the
               servants of agamemnon fight for
               him.
