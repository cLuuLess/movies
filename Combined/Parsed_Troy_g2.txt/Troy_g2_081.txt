82   int. achilles' tent - later - day                              82

     achilles sits cross-legged, arms held straight out in
     front of him, palms up. his bronze sword is balanced on
     his palms.
     patroclus and eudorus, armored for battle, enter the tent.
     achilles does not look away from his blade. though the
     sword must be heavy, his arms do not tremble.

                                 eudorus

                  my lord?   the army is marching.

                                achilles

                  let them march. we stay.

                                eudorus

                  but the men --
     achilles turns to glare at him and eudorus falters.

                               eudorus

                  -- the men are ready.

                                achilles

                  agamemnon spat on my honor
                  yesterday. i promised that girl
                  her safety and he stole her from
                  me. let him fight the trojans
                  today.
     eudorus and patroclus exchange glances. eudorus bows to
     achilles and exits the tent. patroclus remains behind.

                                achilles

                  when i was very small i saw my
                  father kill a man with his bare
                  hands.
     patroclus doesn't know how to respond to this.

                                                     (continued)

                                achilles

                  there's so much blood in a human
                  body.



     achilles flips the sword in the air and catches it by the
     hilt. he examines the edge.

                                achilles

                  you're ready to fight, patroclus?

                                patroclus

                  i am.
     achilles rests his sword on the ground.     he stares at
     patroclus for a moment before speaking.

                                achilles

                  you're ready to kill?
     patroclus hesitates.

                                 achilles

                  at night i see their faces. all
                  the men i've killed. i see them
                  standing on the far bank of the
                  river styx.
                          (beat)
                  they're waiting for me.
     patroclus stands absolutely still.     he's never heard his
     cousin speak this way before.

                                 achilles

                  some nights i walk among them.
                  when i wake i can still hear their
                  words.
                          (beat)
                  they say, "welcome, brother."
     achilles inspects the knuckles of his fist.

                                  achilles

                  never hate the men you fight. all
                  of us are mortals. all of us,
                  wretched things, tumbled crying
                  from our mother's loins.
                           (beat)
                  only the gods are free from
                  sorrows.

                                patroclus

                  i hate no one, cousin.

                                                     (continued)

                                achilles

                  good.
                          (beat)
                  i taught you how to fight. but i
                  never taught you why to fight.

                                patroclus

                  i fight for you.

                                achilles

                  and who will you follow when i'm
                  gone?
     patroclus hesitates, unsure how to answer.

                                achilles

                  most soldiers battle for kings
                  they've never met. they do what
                  they're told; they die when they're
                  told to die.

                                patroclus

                  soldiers obey.

                                achilles

                  we don't have much time to walk in
                  the sun, patroclus. after this
                  life comes the underworld, an
                  eternity telling stories to other
                  shades. don't tell them you died
                  following some fool's orders.

                                patroclus

                  and what should i tell them?

                                achilles

                  tell them your name. if your life
                  has been worthy, they'll know the
                  rest.
