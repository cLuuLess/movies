176    ext. gates of troy - continuous                              176




       the greeks pull the gates open. they wave their torches,
       a signal. looking into the distance, we see something
       shifting in the darkness, coming closer and closer.



       the greek army, shadows in the dark, charges toward the
       city at a sprint, silent. thousands upon thousands of
       warriors running quietly as panthers.
       like water bursting through a dam, the greeks blast
       through the gates, swords and spears raised.
