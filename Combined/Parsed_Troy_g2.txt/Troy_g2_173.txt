174    ext. main square of troy - night                              174




       the square is empty now, all the revelers gone home. the
       wood horse waits in the moonlight. we witness something
       strange: ropes, anchored inside the horse, fall to the
       ground.



       soldiers emerge from the horse and slide silently down the
       ropes: achilles, odysseus and ten other greek soldiers.
       none of them wear the bright, clanking bronze armor.
       their swords and spears are wrapped in lambskins.
       odysseus leads a team of ithacans across the square.
       quiet as shadows, they creep up on the sentries guarding
       the main gate. another team moves toward the guard
       towers.
       achilles stands    alone in the dark square, watching his
       compatriots set    off on their deadly missions. finally he
       turns and moves    in the opposite direction, toward the
       palace. he's on     a different mission.




174a   ext. city gates                                               174a

       two ithacans cut the gate sentries' throats. the soldiers
       begin pulling the chains to raise the city gates.




174b   the trojan rider                                              174b

       gallops to troy. the greeks see him coming and look to
       odysseus for guidance. the rider, still at some distance,
       shouts to the men at the gates.

                               trojan rider

                 they're still here! the greeks are
                 still here! they sailed up the
                 hellespont!
       odysseus hurls his spear. it flies through the bars of
       the gate and into the rider's throat, knocking him from
       his horse. the horse, panicked, gallops away.
