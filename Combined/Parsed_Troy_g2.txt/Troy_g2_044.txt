45   ext. achilles' warship                                         45

     though the oarsmen continue to pull, everyone is now
     armored. achilles sees patroclus, armed and ready to
     fight.

                                achilles

                  where are you going?

                                patroclus

                  to fight the trojans.
     achilles shakes his head and takes patroclus' spear.

                                achilles

                  you're not ready.

                                 patroclus

                  i am ready.   you taught me how to
                  fight.
     achilles rests his hand on the back of the boy's head.

                                achilles

                  and you're a good student.   but
                  you're not a myrmidon yet.
     he gestures to the myrmidons around them.

                                                     (continued)

                                achilles

                  these are the fiercest soldiers in
                  greece. each  of them has bled for
                  me before.
                          (beat)
                  i can't fight the trojans if i'm
                  worrying about you, cousin. guard
                  the ship.
     patroclus looks about the deck. the only unarmored man
     aboard is an old, one-legged cook, mending spears.
     patroclus angrily strips off his breastplate and drops it
     to the deck.
