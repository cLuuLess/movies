78   int. hector's chamber - night                              78

     hector sits on the bed beside andromache, who nurses their
     baby boy.

                                                (continued)

     hector looks exhausted.       he stares at his son.

                                hector

                  he has no idea what's happening.




                                andromache

                  thank the gods.

                                hector

                  the man who killed tecton outside
                  apollo's temple -- i've never seen
                  a spear thrown like that. an
                  impossible throw.
     a long beat until andromache breaks the silence.

                                andromache

                  briseis was in apollo's temple this
                  morning.
     hector stares at andromache.

                                  hector

                  are you sure?
     she nods, swallows hard, and closes her eyes. after a
     moment hector, his eyes full of sorrow, runs his hand
     through her long hair.

                                hector

                  i need to see my brother.

                                  andromache

                  don't go.

                                hector

                  i need to speak with him.




                                andromache

                  i mean tomorrow. don't go. you've
                  fought enough. let other men go
                  out there.

                                hector

                  you think i want to fight, my love?
                  i want to see my son grow tall. i
                  want to see the girls chasing after
                  him.

                                andromache

                  just like they chased his father?

                                                     (continued)





                                                           72.

                                hector

                  he's much more handsome than i ever
                  was.



     for a moment they sit quietly, watching their son.

                                 andromache

                  i lost seven brothers in the
                  spartan wars. you'd think i'd be
                  good at losing by now.
                          (beat)
                  i can't lose you. i won't survive.
     hector stares at her for a beat before pulling her close
     and kissing her. everything is in this kiss, their entire
     past. andromache finally lets him go and hector walks out
     the door.
