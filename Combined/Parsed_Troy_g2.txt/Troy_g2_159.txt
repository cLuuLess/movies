160   ext. beach encampment - continuous                              160

      achilles gently loads hector's body, now wrapped in the
      shroud, onto a moonlit chariot. priam walks to the
      chariot.
      four myrmidons, keeping a respectful distance, stand
      guard.

                                  achilles

                   your son was the best i've fought.
                   i want you to know that.
                           (beat)
                   in my country the funeral games
                   last twelve days.

                                 priam

                   it's the same in my country.

                                 achilles

                   then no greek will attack troy for
                   twelve days. the prince deserves
                   that honor.
      achilles, hearing footsteps, turns.     briseis emerges from
      the shadows. priam is stunned.

                                 priam

                   briseis?
      priam wraps his arms around her, thrilled she's alive.

                                 priam

                   we thought you were dead, little
                   swan.

                                                      (continued)





                                                               137.

      after a moment briseis turns and looks at achilles.
      nobody speaks for a long beat. tears shine in briseis'
      eyes.




                                 achilles

                   you'll be safe behind the trojan
                   walls.
      achilles reaches into his tunic and    pulls out the shell
      necklace that patroclus had worn.     he fastens it around
      her delicate neck, where the purple    bruises are still
      visible. he speaks quietly to her,     too softly for priam
      to hear.

                                 achilles

                   if i hurt you -- it's not what i
                   wanted.
                           (long beat)
                   you gave me one night of peace in a
                   lifetime of war.
      she stares up at him, her young face mapped with
      conflicting emotions. finally, achilles turns to priam.

                                achilles

                   go. no one will stop you, you have
                   my word.
      priam gets in the chariot.     briseis still looks at
      achilles.

                                 priam

                   come, my girl.
      priam reaches down and helps her onto the chariot. he
      seizes the reins and they're off, the myrmidons escorting
      them to safety. achilles stares at briseis until she's
      gone.
