108   ext. greek campfire - night                                    108

      a band of battle-weary, drunken soldiers stand by a
      campfire. they're exhausted, caked with dirt and their
      comrades' blood.
      they shove briseis back and forth between them. each man
      she bounces into tears off a strip of her robes, which are
      now filthy rags barely covering her body.
      her face seems to have shut down. she has a bruise below
      one eye and her hair is wet with wine. the soldiers stare
      at her with a mix of hostility and lust.

                                 aphaereus

                   you trojan whore.

                                                      (continued)





                                                                100.

                                 echepolus

                   we should kill her now, keep her
                   from breeding any more trojan
                   bastards.




                                 aphaereus

                   no, she's agamemnon's property.
                           (tearing off a
                            sleeve)
                   what's this? a virgin's robe?

                                 haemon

                   you won't be needing that much
                   longer.
      haemon squats by the fire, holding an iron in the flames.
      he pulls out a branding iron in the shape of agamemnon's
      seal: a white-hot alpha. he carries it toward briseis.

                                 haemon

                   hold her down.
      briseis sees the hot iron and begins to struggle,
      screaming and kicking at the men. four of the soldiers
      pin her down.

                                 haemon

                   why are you kicking, girl? better
                   to be a spartan slave than a trojan
                   priestess.
      briseis claws haemon in the face.        he growls and punches
      her.

                                 haemon

                   come on, come on, hold her down.
      the soldiers hold her in the sand. haemon steadies the
      hot brand and searches for the best place to mark her.
      when the brand is inches from her arm someone grabs the
      iron, pulls it out of haemon's hands and then slams it
      down on the man's head. haemon collapses.
      achilles stands alone, unarmed save for the branding iron.
      by firelight he looks ferocious. echepolus stumbles
      backward.

                                 echepolus

                   achilles.
      aphaereus spits in the sand.        he draws his sword.

                                                       (continued)

                                 aphareus

                   there's one of him and ten of us.
      achilles swings the iron, almost too fast for the eye to
      follow. aphaereus's face collapses. he falls to the
      beach.

                                   achilles

                   nine.
      the other soldiers run. achilles lifts briseis to her
      feet. more gently than we would have believed possible,
      achilles brushes the sand from her face and hair.

                                   achilles

                   can you walk?
      briseis nods. achilles, arm around her shoulder, leads
      her away from the campfire.
