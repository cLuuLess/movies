      briseis kneels by apollo's statue, ignoring the inferno
      around her.

                              agamemnon (o.s.)

                too late for prayer, priestess.
      briseis does not look up. agamemnon grabs her long hair
      and pulls her to her feet. he holds his sword to her
      throat. two of his bodyguards stand behind him.

                              agamemnon

                your parents should have taught you
                to stand for a king.

                              briseis

                they did.

                              agamemnon

                you wore a white robe when i last
                saw you. no more? did brave
                achilles ruin you for the temple?
      briseis does not look at him or answer. he pulls her
      close.

                              agamemnon

                i almost lost this war because of
                your little romance. i want to
                taste what achilles tasted.
