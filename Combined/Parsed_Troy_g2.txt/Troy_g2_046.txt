47   ext. achilles' warship - day                                    47

     achilles stands in his ship's bow, scanning the trojan
     dunes. he turns to face his men. he smiles.

                                achilles

                  myrmidons, we are brothers of the
                  sword. i'd rather fight alongside
                  you than any army of thousands.

     the myrmidons cheer.     achilles points his sword toward
     troy.

                                 achilles

                  do you know what's waiting beyond
                  that beach?
                          (beat)
                  immortality.
     the myrmidons raise their swords and cry out with one
     voice.
     the oarsmen give one last mighty pull on their oars and
     beach the tar-caulked keel of the warship on trojan sand.
     achilles puts on his helmet, grabs a coiled rope anchored
     to a bronze cleat, and rappels down to the beach. the
     myrmidons follow him, tossing the ropes off the deck and
     shimmying down to the beach.
