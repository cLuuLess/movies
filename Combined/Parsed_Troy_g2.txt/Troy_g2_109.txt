110   int. achilles' tent - later                                      110

      achilles sits near briseis,      watching her. she's clean
      now, dressed in a new robe      -- a man's robe, far too big
      for her. platters of fruit       and roasted meats sit near
      her, along with pitchers of      wine and water. briseis
      doesn't touch any of it.

                                 achilles

                   you should eat.
      briseis says nothing.

                                 achilles

                   did they hurt you?

                                 briseis

                   what do you think?

                                                       (continued)

                                 achilles

                   i saw you fight them. you have
                   courage.




                                 briseis

                   to fight back when people attack
                   me? a dog has that kind of
                   courage.

                                 achilles

                   i like dogs more than people.
      briseis stares into achilles' eyes. he's not used to
      people meeting his gaze. he stares back at the girl,
      intrigued.

                                 briseis

                   why did you choose this life?

                                 achilles

                   what life?

                                 briseis

                   this... to be a great warrior.

                                 achilles

                   i chose nothing. i was born and
                   this is what i am.

                                 briseis

                   but you must enjoy it.

                                  achilles

                   does the scorpion feel joy when he
                   stings the beetle?
                           (beat)
                   i doubt it. i doubt he feels
                   anything at all.

                                 briseis

                   but you're not a scorpion.   you're
                   a man.

                                 achilles

                   and you're a woman in love with a
                   god. where was apollo when those
                   men tried to scar you?

                                 briseis

                   do you enjoy provoking me?

                                 achilles

                   yes.

                                                      (continued)

      they watch each other, achilles smiling, briseis angry.

                                 achilles

                   you've dedicated your life to the
                   gods, yes?
      briseis, glaring at him, doesn't answer.

                                 achilles

                   zeus, god of thunder. athena,
                   goddess of wisdom. you serve them?

                                briseis

                   of course.

                                 achilles

                   and aries, god of war, who blankets
                   his bed with the skins of men he's
                   killed?
      briseis pauses, caught in the trap.

                                 briseis

                   all the gods are to be feared and
                   respected.
      for a long beat they are silent, staring at each other.
      the air between them is charged with more than mere
      contention.

                                 briseis

                   what do you want here in troy? you
                   didn't come for the spartan queen.

                                 achilles

                   i want what all men want.   i just
                   want it more.
      achilles takes an apple and unsheathes a dagger. he
      tosses the apple in his hand. on the third toss he whips
      his knife-hand up and across and neatly catches four apple
      quarters.
      he offers a quarter to briseis. stunned, she slowly
      shakes her head. achilles shrugs and eats the sliced
      apple.

                                 achilles

                   i'll tell you a secret-- something
                   they didn't teach you in your
                   temple. the gods envy us. they
                   envy us because we're mortal,
                   because every moment might be our
                   last. everything is more beautiful
                   for the doomed.
      he stares at her with such intensity she must look away.

                                  achilles

                   you will never be lovelier than you
                   are right now. and we will never
                   be here again.
      briseis is quiet for a moment. she rubs the ripe purple
      grapes on the platter beside her.

                                 briseis

                   i thought you were a dumb brute.
      she looks into achilles' eyes.

                                 briseis

                   i could have forgiven a dumb brute.
