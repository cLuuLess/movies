175    ext. guard tower - continuous                                 175

       one of the sentries, hearing the commotion, wakes up.
       groggy, he looks over the edge of the tower -- into a
       greek's face. the greek, one hand on the ladder, stabs
       the sentry. another greek crawls into the tower and kills
       the second sentry.
