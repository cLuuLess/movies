125   ext. beach encampment - night                                   125

      patroclus's body lies atop a massive funeral pyre, dressed
      in a simple white frock.

       achilles, clean now, all the    soot washed away by the sea,
       scrubs patroclus's face with    a damp cloth. as fastidious
       as a mother, achilles scrubs    away the dried blood on the
       boy's lips, the dirt on his    chin, the crusted blood on his
       cut throat. he removes the     shell necklace.
       agamemnon stands with nestor in the crowd surrounding the
       pyre. agamemnon watches the rite with ill-concealed
       pleasure.

                                  agamemnon

                    that boy just saved the war for us.
       odysseus stands nearby.     melancholy and fatigue age his
       face.
       when the boy is clean achilles pulls two coins from a
       leather pouch. he places one coin over each of the dead
       boy's eyes. he kisses the boy's forehead and descends
       from atop the pyre. eudorus hands him a torch and
       achilles sets the pyre on fire.
