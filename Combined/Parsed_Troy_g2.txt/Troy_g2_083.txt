84    ext. battlefield - continuous                               84




      below the walls, on the broad field that stretches down
      from the city gates, the trojan army has amassed. in the
      front, hector and general glaucus sit astride their
      horses.



      the soldiers are disciplined and well-outfitted, arranged
      in tight formation.
      paris rides out to join hector.   hector examines paris's
      face.

                              hector

                are you sure you want to do this?

                              paris

                i started this war.
      paris searches the faces atop the city wall.   he finds
      helen.
      close on helen. the wind is blowing hard, ruffling her
      cloak, her hair. there is love in her eyes, and fear and
      exhaustion. paris stares up at her for a long time before
      turning away.
      a low, ominous rumble grows steadily louder. hector hears
      it first. he looks down the vast sloping field toward the
      sea.
      now the other soldiers hear it, and then the citizens atop
      the walls. all speech ceases. the trojans quietly wait.
      the rumbling resolves into the steady beat of war drums.

      and now we see them, fifty thousand greeks. the
      reflection of sunlight off fifty thousand bronze shields,
      fifty thousand bronze helmets and chest plates, is
      spectacular -- the army looks like a river of lava,
      flowing uphill.




84b   ext. walls of troy                                          84b

      the trojan soldiers don't quiver or waver, but the
      expressions on their faces betray their anxiety. the
      greek army is more than twice the size of the trojan army.




                                                         79.
