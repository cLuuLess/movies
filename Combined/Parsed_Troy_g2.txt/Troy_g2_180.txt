181   ext. trojan streets - night                                181

      families of terrified civilians stagger through the
      streets in their bedclothes. mothers clutch their
      children's hands. old women flee their burning buildings.
      the women scream when they see achilles running toward
      them, sword drawn. but pillaging is the last thing on his
      mind.
