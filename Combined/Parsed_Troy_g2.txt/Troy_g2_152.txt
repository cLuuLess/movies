153   int. achilles' tent - continuous                            153

      briseis kneels in the center of the tent, palms pressed
      together, eyes lowered in prayer. she opens her eyes and
      looks up when achilles walks in.
      he looks more beast than man, splattered with hector's
      blood. briseis sees achilles' face and knows what
      happened. for the first time her strength deserts her.
      she looks very young, very childlike as she begins to cry.
      he regards her for a moment before going to his bedding
      and lying on his back. we stay on his face as briseis
      weeps.
