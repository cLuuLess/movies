161   int. agamemnon's tent - day                                     161

      agamemnon paces about his tent in a murderous fury.
      odysseus, nestor and several aides stand in attendance.

                                 agamemnon

                           (shouting)
                   achilles makes a secret pact and i
                   have to honor it?! what treason is
                   this?

                                 (more)


                                                      (continued)





                                                            138.

                                 agamemnon (cont'd)

                           (fairly spitting
                            the words)
                   consorting with the enemy king!
                   giving him twelve days of peace.
                   peace! their prince is dead; their
                   army is leaderless. this is the
                   time to attack!

                                 nestor

                   even with hector gone, we have no
                   way to breach their walls. they
                   can wait ten years for us to leave.

                              agamemnon

      i will smash their walls to the ground. if it costs me
      forty thousand greeks, zeus hear me, i will smash their
      walls to the ground.
      nestor and odysseus exchange troubled glances.
