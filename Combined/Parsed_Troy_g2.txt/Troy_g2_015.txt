     paris pauses in front of his cabin door.

                                paris

                  before you get angry with me --

                                hector

                  open the door.
     paris opens the door. helen, wearing a hooded robe, sits
     on the edge of a hammock, swinging slightly. she stands.
     hector stares at her in disbelief. he turns and glares at
     paris.

                                hector

                  if you weren't my brother i'd kill
                  you where you stand.

                                paris

                  hector --
     hector is already out the door.      helen looks at paris.

                                helen

                  we'll never have peace.

                                paris

                  i don't want peace.    i want you.

     he kisses her -- a desperate, hungry kiss, the two of them
     against the world -- then turns and follows his brother.
