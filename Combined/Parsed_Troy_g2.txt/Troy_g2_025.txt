25   ext. seashore - sunset                                      25

     achilles finds his mother, thetis (45), standing in the
     surf. her long black hair is streaked with gray. she
     sees a shell that she likes and stoops down to pick it up.

                              achilles

               mother.
     thetis turns and smiles at achilles.

                             thetis

               i thought i'd make you another
               seashell necklace.

                             achilles

               i haven't worn a seashell necklace
               since i was a boy.
     thetis looks at achilles' bare neck.

                             thetis

               don't you like them anymore?
     achilles spots a good shell.   he hands it to his mother.

                             thetis

               oh, that's a pretty one.
     she surveys the beach for more pretty shells.

                             achilles

               they want me for another war.
     thetis bends down and scoops up a silvery shell.

                             achilles

               are you listening?

                              thetis

               yes, my sweet.   another war.

                             achilles

               patroclus wants to go.

                             thetis

               patroclus has never seen war.

                                                (continued)





                                                            33.

     thetis examines the shells in the palm of her hand.
     finally she stands and looks at her son.

                                thetis

                  if you stay here, with me, with
                  your family, you'll have a long,
                  peaceful life. you'll marry,
                  you'll have children, and your
                  children will have children.
                  they'll love you, and when you're
                  gone they'll remember you. but
                  when your children are dead, and
                  their children after them, your
                  name will be lost.
     thetis reaches up to touch her son's cheek. her eyes are
     clear, her voice steady. she speaks these lines with no
     hesitation, no doubt.

                                thetis

                  if you go to troy, no one    will earn
                  more glory than you. men     will tell
                  stories of your victories    for
                  thousands of years. the     world will
                  remember your name.
     achilles stares at her, his eyes burning. these are words
     he's wanted to hear since the day he was born. his mother
     waits a moment before speaking again. the words hurt her.

                                thetis

                  but if you go to troy, you'll never
                  come home. you'll die there.

                                achilles

                  and you know this, mother?

                               thetis

                  i know it.
     achilles looks out to the sea.     thetis, tears in her eyes,
     smiles bravely.

                                 thetis

                  whenever your father came home from
                  war, he'd stare at the sea, just
                  like that.
                          (beat)
                  he never stayed for long.
     in the distance achilles sees a white sail. he fixates on
     the lonely spot of white on the endless expanse of dark
     water.




                                                          34.
