     we soar above the greatest armada the world has ever seen.
     one thousand ships sail east, crowding the sea, churning
     the waves with their keels.



     the   white sails are painted with the signs and emblems of
     the   various nationalities represented in this alliance.
     one   ship sails slightly out of formation. alone amongst
     the   entire fleet, this ship's sail is black.
