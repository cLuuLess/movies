145   ext. battlefield - continuous                               145

      achilles, sensing the advantage, moves in a step too
      close.
      hector sees an opening and slashes. achilles jumps back
      at the last possible moment, but hector's blade gouges out
      a long strip of bronze from achilles' breastplate.
      both men swing. their swords lock and for a moment
      everything is still. achilles' face is inches from
      hector's. hector is sweating and breathing heavily.
      achilles is not.
      achilles shoves hector and relaunches his attack. while
      hector still fights ably, he's clearly tiring. as
      achilles' blows force hector back, the prince steps on a
      rock, trips, and falls. achilles stands above him.

                              achilles

                get up, prince of troy. i won't
                let a stone take my glory.
      hector stands. he knows his energy is fading fast. so he
      spends everything on one last try. he charges, swinging
      with explosive fury, putting all his might into each blow.
      when the barrage is finished and hector pauses for a
      breath, he sees that achilles, unhurt, has parried
      everything. now achilles bores in, swinging. hector
      blocks and blocks, but doesn't have the stamina for a new
      assault.
      achilles lunges. hector raises his shield. the sword
      plunges through the seven layers of oxhide, plunges
      through the hammered bronze of the shield, the bronze of
      the breastplate, all the way into hector's heart.
      hector looks down at the blade. he looks at achilles.
      there is no mercy or remorse on the man's face.
      hector falls.
