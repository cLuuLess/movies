      hector lies on his back. achilles pulls out his bloody
      sword and walks to his chariot. hector blinks. the sun,
      now high in the sky, is blinding. hector stares into the
      sun and dies.
      silence.     silence everywhere.   no victory cry from the
      greeks.
      achilles returns in the chariot. he jumps out with the
      coil of rope. he ties hector's ankles together, then ties
      the other end of the rope to the back of the chariot.
