122    ext. achilles' warship - later                                 122

       eudorus walks up to the ship, takes a few deep breaths,
       and calls to his commander.

                                   eudorus

                    achilles!
       achilles emerges from the ship's cabin and walks to the
       bow. he descends the gangplank to the beach. briseis
       follows.
       eudorus bows. achilles examines his captain. eudorus is
       sweaty and dirty, his hands caked with dried blood. his
       helmet is off but he still wears his armor.

                                  achilles

                    you've been fighting.

                                   eudorus

                    my lord --

                                  achilles

                    you violated my command.

                                   eudorus

                    no, my lord.   there was a mistake.

                                  achilles

                    a mistake? i ordered the myrmidons
                    to stand down. you led them into
                    combat?

                                  eudorus

                    i didn't lead them.
       eudorus cannot meet his commander's gaze.

                                   achilles

                    who did?

                                  eudorus

                    we thought you did.
       now achilles can tell, staring at his captain's face, that
       something is very wrong. he looks around the encampment.
       all the men returning from combat avoid looking at
       achilles.

                                 achilles

                   where's patroclus?

                                 eudorus

                   we thought it was you, my lord. we
                   -- he wore your armor. your
                   shield, your grieves, your helmet.
                           (long beat)
                   he's dead, my lord.

                                   achilles

                   you're lying.

                                 eudorus

                   never, my lord. never. he looked
                   like you. he even moved like you.
                   we all followed --

                                   achilles

                   lies.

                                 eudorus

                   he fought well, my lord. with
                   great courage. but hector came
                   after him.
      achilles' nostrils are flared, his eyes narrowed.

                                 eudorus

                   if i could have saved him --
      achilles hits eudorus hard in the mouth. the captain
      falls to the sand. achilles looms above him, fists
      clenched. eudorus holds his mouth. blood is already
      beginning to stream out.

                                   achilles

                   liar!

                                 eudorus

                   my lord, i saw him fall.
      achilles seizes eudorus by the hair and hauls him to his
      knees. he snatches eudorus's sword and raises it.
      briseis grabs achilles' shoulder.

                                   briseis

                   don't!
      with his free hand achilles grabs her throat. she claws
      at his wrist. her feet spasm and kick inches off the
      ground.

                                                    (continued)





                                                              119.

      eyes bulging, she stares at him. whatever kindness she'd
      seen in his eyes before, whatever tenderness, it's gone
      now.



      achilles drops her. she sags to the ground, gasping for
      breath, beginning to sob. achilles releases eudorus. the
      captain remains on his knees, watching his lord.

                                achilles

                   dead?

                                 eudorus

                   hector cut his throat.
      achilles walks to a dead campfire where the myrmidons cook
      their dinner. he drops eudorus's sword and kneels in the
      ashes, grabs handfuls of the soot, and blackens his face.
      achilles stands, grabs the sword, and walks toward the
      sea. everyone stares at him. he keeps walking as the
      waters lap at his ankles, his knees, his waist.
      the waves are high, crashing down on     him, but achilles
      does not turn from them. he swings      the sword, chopping
      through the surf, slicing the crests     off the waves,
      groaning as he fights. the soldiers      on the beach stare at
      him.
      achilles battles the sea.
