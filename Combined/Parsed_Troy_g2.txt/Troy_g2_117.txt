118   int. achilles' warship - day                                118

      briseis sits in the cabin watching achilles tie a hammock
      to a peg. something has changed between them. she looks
      at him with undisguised tenderness.

                              briseis

                am i still your captive?

                              achilles

                captive is a harsh word.     you're my
                guest.

                              briseis

                in troy, guests can leave whenever
                they want.

                              achilles

                strange custom.
      achilles takes her hand and inspects her uncalloused
      palms.

                              achilles

                you've never worked the fields.
                never chopped wood, never carried a
                milk pail. these are the hands of
                royalty.
      achilles raises his own hands and shows them to her.

                               achilles

                my hands are gates to the
                underworld.
                        (beat)
                all my life i've walked with death.
                but i grow tired of his company.
                        (beat)
                come with me to larissa.
      a hint of a smile crosses her lips.

                               briseis

                larissa.   is that where you're
                from?
                        (beat)
                it's a pretty name.

                                                   (continued)





                                                          112.

                                  achilles

                   i thought i'd never see it again.
                           (beat)
                   before i left home my mother told
                   me my fate.

                                 briseis

                           (sincere)
                   she speaks with the gods?

                                  achilles

                   she knows things.
                           (beat)
                   she told me if i stayed home i'd
                   have a long, peaceful life. and if
                   i came to troy, life would be
                   short... but my name would never be
                   forgotten.

                                 briseis

                   and you chose troy.

                                  achilles

                   but what if fate brought me here
                   for another purpose? what if i had
                   to go to war to find peace?
                           (beat)
                   to find you?
      she cups his face between her palms, pulls him closer,
      kisses his lips. for a moment they gaze at each other,
      until the sounds of war cries, horns, and battle drums
      fill the air.
      achilles raises his head and listens, his face hardening.
      briseis, alarmed, watches him.
