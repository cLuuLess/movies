12   int. palace - courtyard - later                                12

     a group of trojan soldiers lies on goatskins and furs
     around a bonfire built in the middle of the courtyard.
     some sleep; some continue to drink and sing old trojan
     songs.
     hector stands by the fire, conferring with tecton (30), a
     bull-necked captain of the elite apollonian guard.

                                hector

                  make the proper offerings to
                  poseidon before we sail. we don't
                  need any more widows in troy.

                                  tecton

                  goat or pig?

                                hector

                  which does the sea god prefer?

                                                     (continued)





                                                             16.





12   continued:                                                    12





                                tecton

                          (smiling)
                  i'll wake the priest and ask him.



     tecton bows and exits the courtyard. hector sees paris
     slinking past the bonfire, sneaking toward his quarters.

                                hector

                  paris!
     paris turns, smiles and waves, acting as if he hadn't seen
     hector before. he ambles over to join his brother.

                                hector

                  you should get to bed. we won't
                  sleep on land again for weeks.

                                paris

                  i have no trouble sleeping on the
                  seas. the sea nymphs sing
                  lullabies to me.

                                hector

                  and who sang lullabies to you
                  tonight?
     paris freezes for a moment but quickly regains his poise.

                                paris

                  tonight? tonight was the
                  fisherman's wife. a lovely
                  creature.

                                hector

                  i hope you didn't let the fisherman
                  catch you.

                                paris

                  he's more concerned with the fish.
     paris smiles and starts to walk away but hector holds him.

                                hector

                  you do understand why we're in
                  sparta?

                                paris

                  for peace.

                                                    (continued)





                                                               17.

                                hector

                  and you do understand that
                  menelaus, king of sparta, is a
                  powerful man? and that his
                  brother, agamemnon, king of
                  mycenae, commands all the greek
                  forces?

                                paris

                  what does this have to do with the
                  fisherman's wife?
     hector seizes paris's face between the palms of his hand.
     not a violent gesture, exactly, but not gentle, either.

                                hector

                  paris. you're my brother, and i
                  love you. but if you do anything
                  to endanger troy i'll rip your
                  pretty face from your pretty skull.
     he kisses paris on the forehead.

                                hector

                  get some sleep. we sail in the
                  morning.
     paris, a bit shocked by the encounter, stumbles away.
