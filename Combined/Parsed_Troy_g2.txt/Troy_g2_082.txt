83   ext. walls of troy - day                                     83

     one thousand archers stand in various positions on the
     broad city walls, quivers of arrows by their sides.
     trojan citizens also crowd atop the walls, quiet and
     sober.
     priam sits in a grandstand beneath a blue canopy.   seated
     by him are city leaders, including velius and
     archeptolemus.
     helen stands apart from everyone else. no one is overtly
     hostile to her, but behind her back people stare and
     whisper.
