      odysseus sits with his ithacans by the fire. the men eat
      a breakfast of grilled fish. the soldier sitting beside
      odysseus whittles with a sharp knife.
      odysseus watches the man work. the soldier notices his
      king's attention. he smiles and holds up a small wood

      horse.


                                 soldier

                   for my boy back home.
      odysseus nods, never taking his eyes off the toy horse.
