69   ext. beach encampment - later                               69

     soldiers tug more and more ships onto the sand. from the
     landed ships, primitive cranes are already beginning to
     lower boxes of provisions, military materiel, and horses.
     achilles walks across the beach, carrying his helmet,
     accepting the congratulations of the troops. ajax,
     shirtless, strides over.

                               ajax

               achilles!
     achilles halts. for a moment there seems to be tension in
     the air. everyone watches. ajax gives achilles a bear
     hug.

                             ajax

               you're as fearless as a god.

                             achilles

               the gods are immortal.   what do
               they have to fear?
     ajax laughs and releases achilles.

                             ajax

               i'm honored to go to war with you.
     achilles nods and grips the big man's thick arm.

                                                  (continued)





                                                              59.





69   continued:                                                       69





                                achilles

                  i don't have to worry about my back
                  with you behind me.



     achilles continues walking. he sees odysseus walking down
     a gangplank from his ship to the beach.

                                 achilles

                          (calling out)
                  if you sailed any slower, the war
                  would be over.

                                odysseus

                  i don't mind missing the beginning
                  of the war -- as long as i'm here
                  at the end.
     achilles smiles and keeps walking. he arrives at the
     myrmidon's newly established base. patroclus, eudorus,
     and the other surviving myrmidons greet achilles.

                                eudorus

                  we have something to show you.
     achilles follows eudorus and the grinning myrmidons to a
     large tent twenty yards inland from their beached ship. a
     few myrmidons hammer the last tent pegs deep into the
     sand.
     eudorus holds open the tent flap. achilles looks at his
     captain for a moment before entering the tent.
