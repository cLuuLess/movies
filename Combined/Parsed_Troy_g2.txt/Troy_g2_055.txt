56    ext. trojan beach dunes - day                              56

      hector and the apollonian guards rein in their horses atop
      the dunes. hector sees ajax's ship plowing into the
      beach. hundreds of other ships are close behind.




                                                           51.

      the trojan archers rain arrows down on ajax's ship.
      several flaming arrows catch in the hull and begin to
      burn.

                              tecton

                we can't hold the beach, my prince.
      hector sees where achilles and the myrmidons are heading.

                              hector

                they're trying to take the temple.

                              tecton

                no believer would spill blood in
                apollo's temple.
      hector, increasingly uneasy, watches achilles dodge
      arrows. he turns and points to the spot where ajax's ship
      has landed.

                              hector

                        (to an apollonian officer)
                the archers need help. burn as
                many ships as you can, but don't
                sacrifice yourself. bring the men
                back to the city.
      the officer bows and leads 60 guards to the
      fortifications.

                              hector

                        (to tecton)
                follow me.
      he gallops toward the temple, tecton and his men behind
      him.
