70   int. achilles' tent - continuous                                 70

     no rugs have been laid down yet, so loot from the temple
     has been stacked on the sand: gold chalices, black
     amphorae, woven tapestries, goatskins filled with sacred
     wine.
     but achilles does not look at this plunder. bound by the
     wrists to the center pole of the tent is briseis, dressed
     in her white robes.
     terrified but trying to retain her composure,      she returns
     achilles' stare. robes torn, hair disheveled,       bleeding
     from the lip: she still possesses her innate       dignity and
     strength.  something changes in achilles' eyes      when he
     looks at her.

                                eudorus

                  the men found her hiding in the
                  temple. they thought she'd...
                  please you.




                                achilles

                  leave us.
     eudorus bows and exits.
     achilles pulls a small, sharp knife from his belt.
     briseis stares at the blade.
     achilles walks over to her and cuts the ropes that bind
     her. she sits back, rubbing the chafed skin of her
     wrists, still watching achilles. he sheathes his knife.

                                achilles

                  what's your name?
     briseis stares at    him but doesn't answer. achilles
     becomes aware, for    the first time, that he's covered in
     blood. he wipes a     hand across his face. briseis looks
     about the tent, as    if searching for a way out.

                                achilles

                  you're safer in this tent than out
                  there. believe me.

                                briseis

                  you killed apollo's priests.

                                achilles

                  i've killed men in five countries.
                  but never a priest.

                                 briseis

                  then your men did.
                          (beat)
                  the sun god will have his
                  vengeance.
     achilles removes his bronze grieves.

                                achilles

                  what's he waiting for?
     briseis is stunned by such blunt blasphemy but she can't
     take her eyes off him, because achilles, after all, is
     achilles.

                                briseis

                  the right time to strike.

     achilles removes his breastplate.

                                 achilles

                  his priests are dead and his
                  acolyte's a captive.
                          (beat)
                  i think your god is afraid of me.
     briseis laughs bitterly.

                               briseis

                  afraid? apollo is master of the
                  sun. he fears nothing.
     achilles nods and looks around the dark tent.

                                achilles

                  then where is he?
     briseis has no answer.     achilles smiles and she looks
     away.
     a bucket of hot water sits beside a washcloth. achilles
     wets the cloth and begins to scrub the blood from his
     body.

                                briseis

                  you're nothing but a killer. you
                  don't know anything about the gods.

                                 achilles

                  you haven't seen twenty summers and
                  you think you know my heart? i
                  know more about the gods than
                  priests could ever teach you.
                          (beat)
                  you're royalty, aren't you?
     briseis says nothing.     achilles smiles again.

                                 achilles

                  you've spent years talking down to
                  men, you must be royalty. what's
                  your name?
                          (beat)
                  even the servants of apollo have
                  names.

                                briseis

                  briseis.

                                achilles

                  are you afraid, briseis?
     briseis is quiet for a moment. she watches achilles with
     a mixture of fear and curiosity.

                                 briseis

                  should i be?

                                eudorus (o.s.)

                          (calling from outside
                           the tent)
                  my lord --

                                 achilles

                  what is it?
     eudorus sticks his head inside the tent.

                                eudorus

                  king agamemnon requests your
                  presence.

                                achilles

                  why would i want to look at him
                  when i can look at her?

                                eudorus

                  all the kings are there,
                  celebrating the victory.
     achilles stands.

                                achilles

                  give me a moment.
     eudorus withdraws.     a long beat while achilles studies
     her.

                                achilles

                  you don't need to fear me, girl.
                  you're the only trojan who can say
                  that.
