114   int. achilles' tent - morning                                  114

      achilles watches briseis sleep. she looks very young and
      fragile, her face bruised, her eyelids fluttering as she
      dreams. achilles watches her with great tenderness.
      eudorus opens the tent flap. sunlight streams in.
      achilles puts a finger over his mouth. eudorus sees
      briseis and nods. achilles gently pulls the blanket over
      her naked shoulders. he stands and exits.
