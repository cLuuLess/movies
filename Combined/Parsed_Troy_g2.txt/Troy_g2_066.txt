67   ext. trojan beach - day                                     67




     thousands of greek soldiers on the beach watch as the
     trojans retreat, many of the archers riding behind their
     apollonian saviors.



     hector mounts his horse and rides back toward the city.
     when the greeks see achilles climbing onto the temple's
     roof they stare in awe, silent.
     achilles raises his bloodied bronze sword toward the sun.
     the clamor that erupts from the beach is deafening.
     thousands of men cheering and yelling his name: achilles!
     achilles!
