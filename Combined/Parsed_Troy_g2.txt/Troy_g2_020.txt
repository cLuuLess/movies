20   int. mycenae citadel - throne room - day                          20

     menelaus and his followers enter the throne room.
     treasures from various conquests fill the room: statuary
     and urns and intricate gold work. armed guards stand at
     their posts.

                                                     (continued)

     only agamemnon is seated, on a beautiful throne carved
     from solid oak. two robed nobles are addressing him when
     menelaus enters -- they move away as the spartans
     approach.



     agamemnon stands.     the two kings embrace.

                                agamemnon

                  your messenger came two days ago.
                  i know what happened.
     menelaus's face darkens, his rage barely submerged.

                                menelaus

                  i want her back.

                                agamemnon

                  of course you do. she's a
                  beautiful woman.

                                menelaus

                  i want her back so i can kill her
                  with my own two hands. i won't
                  rest until i've burned troy to the
                  ground.

                                agamemnon

                          (smiling)
                  i thought you wanted peace with
                  troy.

                                menelaus

                  i should have listened to you.

                                agamemnon

                  peace is for the women and the
                  weak. empires are forged by war.

                                menelaus

                  all my life i've stood by your
                  side, fought your enemies. you're
                  the eldest, you reap the glory --
                  this is the way of the world. but
                  have i ever complained, brother?
                  have i ever asked you for anything?

                                agamemnon

                  never. you're a man of honor.
                  everyone in greece knows this.

                                                    (continued)

                                menelaus

                  the trojans spat on my honor. an
                  insult to me is an insult to you.




                                agamemnon

                  and an insult to me is an insult to
                  all greeks.

                                menelaus

                  will you go to war with me,
                  brother?
     menelaus reaches out his hand. agamemnon looks into his
     eyes. finally he nods and clasps hands with his brother.
