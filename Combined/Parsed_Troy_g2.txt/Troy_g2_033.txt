34    ext. guard tower - dawn                                     34

      two sentries stand in a guard tower on a corner of troy's
      city walls, sipping hot broth from bowls. a large flag,
      emblazoned with troy's horse emblem, flies above the
      tower.
      sentry #1 blows steam off his soup. he raises his eyes,
      blinks and squints into the distance. he bolts upright.
      sentry #2 stands and follows his partner's gaze out to the
      sea. both of them stand slack-jawed.




34a   a thousand greek warships                                   34a

      clog the horizon, sailing straight for troy.




34b   sentry #2                                                   34b

      grabs a gong tapper and begins hammering the brass gong
      hanging from the tower's lintel. sentry #1 still stares
      at the swarm of ships. no trojan has ever seen such a
      force.




34c   sentries                                                    34c

      in other guard towers hammer their warning gongs.
