21   int. mycenae citadel - throne room - night                   21

     agamemnon paces the vast, torch-lit room. nestor sits at
     a wooden table. spread out on the table before him is a
     rough map of greece and environs, painted on a tanned goat
     skin.

                                agamemnon

                  i always thought my brother's wife
                  was a foolish woman. but she's
                  proven to be very useful. nothing
                  unifies a people like a common
                  enemy.

                                nestor

                  the trojans have never been
                  conquered. some say they can't be
                  conquered.

                                 agamemnon

                  i haven't tried yet.
                          (beat)
                  old king priam thinks he's
                  untouchable behind his high walls.
                  he thinks the sun god will protect
                  him. but the gods only protect the
                  strong.
                          (points at map)
                  if troy falls, i control the
                  aegean.

                                nestor

                  hector commands the finest army in
                  the east. and troy is built to
                  withstand a ten-year siege.

                                 agamemnon

                  there won't be a ten-year siege.
                  i'll attack them with the greatest
                  force the world has ever seen. i
                  want all the kings of greece and
                  all their armies.
                          (beat)
                  send emissaries in the morning.
     nestor stands and prepares to leave.

                                 nestor

                  one last thing.
                          (beat)
                  we need achilles and his myrmidons.
     agamemnon shakes his head.

                                agamemnon

                  achilles can't be controlled.   he's
                  as likely to fight us as the
                  trojans.

                                nestor

                  we don't need to control him. we
                  need to unleash him. the man was
                  born to end lives.

                                 agamemnon

                  yes, he's a gifted killer, but he
                  follows no king. he threatens
                  everything i've built.
                          (beat)
                  before me greece was nothing, a
                  province of warlords and cattle
                  raiders. i've brought all the
                  greek kingdoms together -- with the
                  sword when necessary, with a treaty
                  when possible. i've created a
                  nation out of fire-worshippers and
                  snake-eaters.
                          (beat)
                  i build the future, nestor.
                  achilles is the past, a man who
                  fights for no flag, a man loyal to
                  no country.
     nestor waits a respectful moment before replying.

                                 nestor

                  your words are true. but how many
                  battles have we won off the edge of
                  his sword?
                          (beat)
                  this will be the greatest war the
                  world has ever seen. we need the
                  greatest warrior.
     agamemnon thinks about it, pacing the room.       finally --

                                agamemnon

                  there's only one man he'll listen
                  to.

                                nestor

                  i'll send a ship in the morning.
