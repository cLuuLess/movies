14   ext. ship's deck - day                                            14

     the winds are strong. nobody needs to row.         sailors tend
     the sails or play dice.
     hector stands in the bow, leaning against the rail,
     whittling a wooden lion. paris joins him.

                                paris

                  a beautiful morning.   poseidon has
                  blessed our voyage.
     hector looks at the blue sky for a moment.

                                                    (continued)

                                hector

                  sometimes the gods bless you in the
                  morning and curse you in the
                  afternoon.



     paris watches his brother work the wood. when paris
     speaks again his tone is more sober than we've heard it
     before.

                                paris

                  do you love me, brother?
     hector rests his knife on the deck and smiles.

                                hector

                  what have you done now?

                                paris

                  i need to show you something.
     paris walks toward the staircase leading inside the ship.
     hector watches him for a few seconds and then follows.
