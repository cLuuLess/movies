192    int. meeting hall - night                                   192

       dozens of greeks charge into the hall, seizing whatever
       treasures they can carry and smashing whatever they can't.
       priam, armed with a sword, rushes into the hall. he sees
       two greeks grabbing small gold figurines of the gods from
       their wall sconces.
       he raises his sword.

                               priam

                 have you no honor? no respect for
                 the gods?

                                                   (continued)

      before priam can move forward he is speared from behind,
      the spearhead tearing through his back and out his chest.
      he falls. agamemnon stands above him. he yanks his spear
      free.




                                 agamemnon

                   i wanted you alive, old king. i
                   wanted you to watch your city burn.

                                 priam

                   please... the children... spare the
                   innocents...

                                 agamemnon

                   let hades decide who's innocent.
      he walks away, leaving the old man to die alone on the
      floor.
