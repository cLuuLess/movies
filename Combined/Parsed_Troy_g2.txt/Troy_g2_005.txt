    achilles prepares for battle, strapping on his
    breastplate. the boy assists him, fixing the bronze
    greaves to his legs.

                               boy

                 are the stories about you true?
                 they say your mother is an immortal
                 goddess.

    achilles lifts up his shield. he slips his left forearm
    into the leather straps on the inside of the shield.

                               boy

                 they say you can't be killed.

                 i wouldn't be bothering with the
                 shield then, would i?




                               boy

                 the thessalonian you're fighting
                 -- he's the biggest man i've ever
                 seen.
    achilles mounts the boy's horse.

                               boy

                 i wouldn't want to fight him.

                               achilles

                 that's why no one will remember
                 your name.

    achilles gallops away, leaving the boy standing alone.
