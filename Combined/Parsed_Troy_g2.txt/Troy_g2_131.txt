132   ext. achilles' tent - morning                                132

      achilles exits his tent, fully armed.
      eudorus is behind him. the soldiers are beginning to stir
      and they stop in their activity now and stare at him.
      two myrmidons tether a chariot to a large black horse.
      the work finished, they step back as achilles hops into
      the chariot. eudorus attempts to hop on behind him.

                                achilles

                   no.
      eudorus looks at his commander for a second and backs
      away.

                                 achilles

                           (to the myrmidons)
                   rope.
      a myrmidon hands him a coil of braided rope and retreats.
      briseis steps into view. her eyes are shadowed from lack
      of sleep. she stares up at achilles and he looks at her.
      she looks fragile today, her pale throat purpled with
      bruises.

                                briseis

                   don't go.
      achilles watches her in silence.

                   hector is my cousin. he's a good
                   man.
                           (beat)
                   take me to larissa with you. but
                   don't fight him. please don't
                   fight him.
                           (beat)
                   we could have a life together, but
                   not if you choose this path.
                           (beat)
                   you can walk away from war. we can
                   walk away.
      achilles gazes at her, considering her words.

                                                   (continued)

      he tugs the reins and the horse begins trotting toward
      troy.
