36    int. priam's meeting hall - day                            36

      priam kneels before a grand statue of zeus in the great
      hall. the thunder god, his stone face a mask of rage,
      thunderbolts clutched in his stone hands, stares down at
      the old king.
      listening to the bells, priam takes a deep breath and looks up
      into zeus's eyes. the father of the gods stares back.
