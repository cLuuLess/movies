79   int. palace hall - later                                    79

     as hector walks to paris's room, he spies someone in a
     dark cloak sneaking down the candle-lit hallway -- an
     assassin?

                                hector

                  wait!
     the cloaked figure looks back and then runs. hector
     chases. the fugitive runs through the archway at the end
     of the corridor and into the garden.
