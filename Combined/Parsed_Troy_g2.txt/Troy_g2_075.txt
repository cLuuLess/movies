76    int. priam's meeting hall - night                           76

      priam stands by the room's open archway. beyond the city
      he sees his beach occupied by the tremendous greek force.
      hector, paris, and several of troy's leading generals,
      aristocrats and priests sit around the long table. one of
      the generals, glaucus (60), pounds the table with his
      fist.

                              glaucus

                if they want a war, we'll give them
                a war. i'd match the best of troy
                against the best of greece any day.
      velior (40), a big-bellied nobleman, shakes his head.

                              velior

                the best of greece outnumber the
                best of troy, two to one.

                              glaucus

                so what do you suggest, we
                surrender the city, let the greeks
                slaughter our men and rape our
                wives?
      velior looks at paris until the prince returns his gaze.

                              velior

                i suggest diplomacy. the greeks
                came here for one thing. let's be
                honest, my friends. trojans are
                burning on the pyre right now
                because of one youthful
                indiscretion.
      paris looks away from velior.

                                                   (continued)

                                priam

                  glaucus, you've fought with me for
                  forty years. can we win this war?




                                glaucus

                  our walls have never been breached.
                  our archers are the best in the
                  world. and we have hector. his
                  men would fight the shades of
                  tartarus if he commanded. we can
                  win.
     archeptolemus (65), high priest of troy, wearing a long
     white robe embroidered with gold thread, now raises his
     voice.

                                 archeptolemus

                  i spoke with two farmers today.
                  they saw an eagle flying with a
                  serpent clutched in its talons.
                          (beat)
                  this is a sign from apollo. we
                  will win a great victory tomorrow.
                  troy is the eagle. the greeks --

                                hector

                  bird signs! you want to plan our
                  strategy based on bird signs?

                                priam

                  hector. show respect. when
                  archeptolemus prophesied four years
                  of drought, we dug deeper wells.
                  the drought came and we had water
                  to drink. the high priest is a
                  servant of the gods.

                                 hector

                  and i'm a servant of troy.
                          (beat)
                  i've always honored the gods,
                  father. you know that. but today
                  i fought with a greek who
                  desecrated the statue of apollo.
                  apollo didn't strike the man down.
                          (beat)
                  the gods won't fight this war for
                  us.

                                paris

                  there won't be a war.
                          (he stands)
                  this is not a conflict of nations.
                  it's a dispute between two men.
                  and i don't want to see another
                  trojan die because of me.

                                priam

                  paris --

                                paris

                  tomorrow morning i will challenge
                  menelaus for the right to helen.
                  the winner will take her home. the
                  loser will burn before nightfall.
     paris leaves the room.     the others sit in stunned silence.

                                glaucus

                  does he have a chance?
     everyone looks at hector, who meditates before answering.

                                hector

                  i want our army outside the gate in
                  the morning. agamemnon won't let
                  this war end with a duel.
