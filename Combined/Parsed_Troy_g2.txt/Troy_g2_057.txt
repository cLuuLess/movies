58   ext. ajax's ship - continuous                                  58

     ajax and his    men rappel down the ship's hull while arrows
     rip into wood    and flesh.
     ajax carries    a giant battle-axe and a shield twice the
     size of most    men's.
     when he reaches the surf he doesn't wait for his men; he
     roars and charges at the archers in the dunes.
