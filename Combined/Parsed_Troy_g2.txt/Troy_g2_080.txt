81   ext. beach encampment - dawn                                  81

     up and down the beach thousands of greek warriors prepare
     for battle. despite their vast numbers, the men are oddly
     quiet, each absorbed with his own thoughts.

     close on several faces -- these are men we haven't seen
     before and probably won't see again, not kings or heroes
     but ordinary men preparing for battle.



     one warrior prays with eyes closed, mumbling the words,
     kneeling in the sand. a second man inspects each
     arrowhead in his quiver. a third sits in the sand,
     snapping seashells.
