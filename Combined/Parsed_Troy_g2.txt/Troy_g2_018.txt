18   ext. trojan ship                                              18

     hector walks quickly toward the stern, paris right behind
     him. the pilot mans the rudder.

                                hector

                          (to pilot)
                  turn us around. back to sparta.

                                paris

                  wait, wait.
     hector spins on his brother.

                                hector

                  you fool.

                                paris

                  listen to me --
     hector shoves his brother backwards. the older brother's
     physical power is obvious. sailors watch in awed silence.

                                hector

                  do you know what you've   done? do
                  you know how many years   our father
                  worked for peace? how    many
                  brothers and cousins he   lost on the
                  battlefield?

                                paris

                  i love her.
     the muscles in hector's jaw bulge against his cheeks.

                                 hector

                  say another word and i'll break
                  your arm. this is all a game for
                  you, isn't it?

                                 (more)


                                                    (continued)





                                                             21.

                                hector (cont'd)

                  you roam from town to town, bedding
                  merchants' wives and temple maids -
                  - you think you know something
                  about love? what about your
                  father's love? you spat on him
                  when you brought her on this ship.
                  what about love of your country?
                  you'd let troy burn for this woman.
     paris starts to speak but hector raises a warning finger.

                                hector

                  i won't let you start a war for
                  her.

                                 paris

                  may i speak?
                          (beat)
                  what you say is true.   i've wronged
                  you. i've wronged our   father. if
                  you want to bring helen  back to
                  sparta, so be it. but   i go with
                  her.

                                 hector

                  to sparta?   they'll kill you.

                                paris

                  then i'll die fighting.
     hector laughs bitterly.      he grabs the collar of paris's
     tunic.

                                hector

                  that sounds heroic to you, doesn't
                  it? to die fighting. tell me,
                  little brother, have you ever
                  killed a man?

                                paris

                  no.

                                hector

                  have you ever even seen a man die
                  in combat?

                                paris

                  no.
     hector's face is flushed with anger.      paris tries to look
     away but hector won't let him.

                                                    (continued)





                                                                 22.





18   continued:    (2)                                                 18





                                 hector

                  i've killed men, brother. i've
                  watched them dying, i've heard them
                  dying, i've smelled them dying.
                          (beat)
                  there's nothing glorious about it,
                  nothing poetic. you think you want
                  to die for love, but you know
                  nothing about dying. you know
                  nothing about love.

                                paris

                  all the same, i go with her.
     hector releases his brother.        he stares at the sea.

                                paris

                  i won't ask you to fight my war.
     hector shakes his head, still staring into the waves.

                                hector

                  you already have.
     for a long time hector is silent. finally he turns to the
     pilot, who awaits the prince's command.

                                hector

                  to troy.
     hector walks away from his brother.
