171   ext. main square of troy - day                              171




      the horse now stands near the statue of poseidon wielding
      his trident, beside his temple on one corner of the city
      square.



      the square is crowded and jubilant. soldiers and citizens
      celebrate their great victory, drinking wine in the
      streets, waving torches and trojan flags, singing songs.
      paris and helen sit on the palace stairs, watching the
      crowd.

                              paris

                look at them. you'd think their
                prince had never died.
      helen takes his hand.

                               helen

                you're their prince.
                        (beat)
                make your brother proud.
      her comment echoes the words hector spoke to him before
      his death. paris nods solemnly. helen rests her head on
      his shoulder. they sit quietly as the crowds sing in the
      street.
