107   int. agamemnon's tent - night                                    107

      nestor sits at a table, poring over the map of troy.
      odysseus lies in a hammock strung between two of the tent
      poles, eating olives and spitting out the pits.
      agamemnon paces the rugs that floor the tent. his usual
      air of supreme confidence is gone, replaced by agitation.

                                 agamemnon

                   they're laughing at me in troy.
                   old priam and the others, drunk on
                   victory. they think i'll  quit
                   these shores, sail home at first
                   light.

                                 odysseus

                   maybe we should.
      agamemnon spins and glares at odysseus.




                                 agamemnon

                   flee like a whipped dog?

                                 odysseus

                   the men believe we came here for
                   menelaus's wife. he won't be
                   needing his wife anymore.

                                 agamemnon

                           (furious)
                   my brother's blood still wets the
                   grass and you insult him?

                                 odysseus

                   it's no insult to say a dead man is
                   dead.

                                 nestor

                   if we leave now we lose all
                   credibility. if the trojans can
                   beat us so easily, how long before
                   the hittites invade?

                                 odysseus

                   you're right. but if we stay, we
                   stay for the right reasons.
                           (to agamemnon)
                   we stay to protect greece, not your
                   pride. your private battle with
                   achilles is destroying us.

                                 agamemnon

                   achilles is one man. what good
                   could he --

                                 odysseus

                   hector is one man. look what he
                   did to us today.

                                 agamemnon

                   hector fights for his country.
                   achilles fights only for himself.

                                 odysseus

                   i don't care about the man's
                   patriotism. i care about his
                   ability to win battles.

                                 nestor

                           (to agamemnon)
                   he's right. the men's morale is
                   weak.




                                 odysseus

                   weak? they're ready to swim home.

                                  agamemnon

                   even if i wanted to make peace with
                   achilles, the man won't listen.
                   he's just as likely to spear me as
                   speak with me.

                                 odysseus

                   i'll talk to him in the morning.
      agamemnon thinks about it for a moment and nods.

                                 nestor

                   he'll want the girl back.

                                 agamemnon

                   he can take the damned girl.   i
                   haven't touched her.

                                   odysseus

                   where is she?

                                 agamemnon

                   i gave her to the men. they needed
                   some amusement after today.
      odysseus and nestor exchange worried looks.
