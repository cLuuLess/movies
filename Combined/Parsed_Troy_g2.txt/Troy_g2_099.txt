100   ext. battlefield - day                                       100

      the trojans are routing the greeks. with two of their
      kings already fallen, the greek force is in disarray.
      odysseus sees agamemnon speeding by on his chariot.
      odysseus runs and manages to leap onto the chariot. the
      two kings shout at each other above the commotion of
      battle.

                                 odysseus

                   we need to retreat!
      agamemnon surveys the battlefield and his battered forces.

                                 agamemnon

                   my army has never lost a battle.

                                 odysseus

                   if we don't fall back you won't
                   have an army!
      agamemnon seems dazed by the turn of events. finally
      odysseus hollers to whichever captains can hear his voice.

                                 odysseus

                   back to the ships! back to the
                   ships!
      the captains take up this cry, shouting orders to their
      men.
      the greeks retreat. the trojan soldiers give a mighty
      shout as they pursue their enemies.
