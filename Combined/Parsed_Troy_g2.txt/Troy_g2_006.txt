6   ext. thessalian valley                                        6

    agamemnon confers with his officers on the battlefield,
    including king nestor (65), his trusted advisor.
    when achilles rides into view the mycenaean soldiers
    cheer. some cry out his name. agamemnon and his officers
    turn to watch achilles dismount and approach them.

                               agamemnon

                 perhaps we should have our war
                 tomorrow, when you're better
                 rested?

    achilles ignores the king and examines the waiting giant.

                               agamemnon

                 i should have you whipped for
                 impudence.

    achilles wheels on the king.

                               achilles

                 who's giving the whipping?
    he walks toward agamemnon, fingers curling over the hilt
    of his sword. nestor slides in between achilles and the
    king.

                              nestor

                 achilles.

                                                    (continued)





                                                              7.

     achilles, nostrils flared, eyes narrowed, stares at
     agamemnon. neither man is willing to turn away.

                                achilles

                          (to agamemnon)
                  why don't you fight him yourself?
                  wouldn't that be a sight, a king
                  who fights his own battles?

                               nestor

                  achilles.
     achilles finally turns and looks at him.

                                nestor

                  look at the men's faces.
     achilles surveys the faces of the battle-weary soldiers.

                                 nestor

                  you can save hundreds of them. you
                  can end this war with a swing of
                  your sword.
                          (beat)
                  think how many songs they'll sing
                  in your honor.
                          (beat)
                  let them go home to their wives.
     the soldiers, awed in his presence, stare at achilles.        he
     finally turns and walks toward boagrius.
     agamemnon watches achilles with undisguised hostility.

                                agamemnon

                          (to nestor, under
                           his breath)
                  of all the warlords loved by the
                  gods, i hate him most.

                                nestor

                  we need him, my king.

                               agamemnon

                  for now.




6a   achilles                                                       6a

     when achilles is forty yards from the giant, boagrius
     turns to his army and shakes his spear over his head.
     they cheer, slamming their bronze swords against their
     bronze shields.

                                                     (continued)





                                                           8.





6a   continued:                                                  6a




     achilles keeps coming.    he looks up at the circling crows.
     boagrius turns and throws his spear. the bronze spearhead
     glitters in the sun, blazing straight for achilles.



     without breaking stride, achilles raises the shield. the
     spearhead blasts through the bronze skin of the shield,
     through the thick leather on the underside, stopping
     inches from achilles' face.

     achilles keeps coming.

     boagrius hoists a second spear and hurls it, grunting with
     effort. again achilles raises his shield, again the
     spearhead tears through the shield but does not harm
     achilles.

     achilles casts aside the shield and keeps coming.
     boagrius unsheathes his tremendous bronze sword. he opens
     his mouth, lets loose a battle cry, and charges at
     achilles.

     when boagrius raises his sword, achilles lunges forward
     with terrifying speed. it does not seem possible that he
     could close the gap between them so quickly, but he does,
     thrusting his sword straight through boagrius'
     breastplate.

     achilles pulls his sword from the giant's chest and
     continues walking toward the thessalonian line, never
     looking back.

     boagrius stares down at the hole in his breastplate.
     blood pumps out, pouring down the polished bronze. he
     topples over.

     the mycenaean army erupts with exultant victory cries.
     achilles now stands in front of the massed thessalonian
     troops. he searches from face to face. none of the
     soldiers are willing to make eye contact with him.
     finally triopas steps out of the ranks.

                                triopas

                  who are you, soldier?

                                achilles

                  achilles, son of peleus.

                                                 (continued)





                                                              9.





6a   continued:    (2)                                                6a





                                  triopas

                  achilles.    i won't forget the name.
     triopas offers achilles the heavy gold scepter.




                                triopas

                  the ruler of thessaly carries this
                  scepter. give it to your king.

                                achilles

                  he's not my king.
     achilles walks west, away from both armies.       the soldiers
     watch him go in silence.
