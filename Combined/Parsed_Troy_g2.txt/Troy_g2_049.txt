50   ext. achilles' warship - continuous                           50

     patroclus huddles under the railing beside the cook as
     arrow after arrow screams by. a flaming arrow hits one of
     the sails, and then another. the sails begin to burn.

                                one-legged cook

                  help me get the sails down!
     the cook limps over to the sails, ignoring the arrows that
     rain around him. patroclus takes a deep breath and runs
     in a crouch to the cook. together they lower the burning
     sails.
