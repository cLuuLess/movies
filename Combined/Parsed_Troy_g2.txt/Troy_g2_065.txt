66   ext. temple of apollo - continuous                          66




     down at the beach, scores of greek ships are on the sand.

                             hector

               why did you come here?



     achilles gestures at the invading flotilla.

                             achilles

               they'll be talking about this war
               for a thousand years.

                             hector

               in a thousand years even the dust
               from our bones will be gone.




                              achilles

               yes, prince.   but our names will
               remain.
     a band of bloodied myrmidons, led by eudorus, emerges from
     the temple. hector, surrounded by enemies, warily backs
     off.

                             eudorus

                       (to achilles)
               the trojans are dead.

                             achilles

               go home, prince. drink some wine.
               make love to your wife. tomorrow
               we'll have our war.

                             hector

               you speak of war as if it's a game.
               but how many wives wait at troy's
               gate for husbands they'll never see
               again?

                             achilles

               perhaps your brother can comfort
               them. i hear he's good at charming
               other men's wives.
     hector stares at achilles and the myrmidons for another
     moment before walking away.

                             eudorus

               why did you let him go?

                             achilles

               it's too early in the day for
               killing princes.




                                                          58.
