165   ext. beach encampment - night                                 165

      by torchlight, we see greeks stripping planks from two
      burnt shells of warships. others pry spikes out of the
      fortifications.
      odysseus watches the men carry the planks and bundles of
      spikes to an ever-growing pile. achilles approaches him.

                                 achilles

                   wily odysseus. you've found a way
                   to make the sheep invite the wolves
                   over for dinner.

                                  odysseus

                   this is war.

                                  achilles

                   agamemnon will kill them all. men,
                   women, children -- all of them.
                   you know that.
      achilles walks away.     odysseus follows him.

                                 odysseus

                   i'm the king of ithaca, not troy.
                   my loyalty is to ithaca. if   this
                   plan works, the war ends in a
                   night. and my men can sail  home to
                   their wives.
      achilles keeps walking, odysseus pacing after him.

                                                    (continued)

                                 odysseus

                   it's not troy you're worried about,
                   is it? it's one trojan. one trojan
                   girl.



      achilles halts.     he stares at odysseus for a long count.

                                 achilles

                   i've always liked you. but if that
                   girl dies because of your plan, you
                   will never sail home to your wife.
      achilles turns and leaves.     odysseus takes a deep breath.
