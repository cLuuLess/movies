157   int. achilles' tent - night                                   157

      achilles still sits alone, his eyes empty. he hears a
      rustling at the tent flap. an old man wearing a hooded
      robe steps inside. the old man pulls his hood down. it's
      priam.

                               achilles

                who are you?
      priam seems physically hurt by the sight of achilles.       for
      a moment it seems he will collapse again.
      but he wills himself onward, walking to achilles' chair.
      he sinks to his knees, takes achilles' hands, and kisses
      them. achilles observes all this with curiosity.

                              priam

                i have endured what no one on earth
                has endured before. i kissed the
                hands of the man who killed my son.

                               achilles

                priam?

      priam nods.    achilles stands, helping the old man to his
      feet.

                                 achilles

                   how did you get in here, old king?
                   the sentries --

                                 priam

                   i know my own country better than
                   the greeks, i think.

                                 achilles

                   you're a brave man. if agamemnon
                   knew you were here, he'd have your
                   head on a spit.

                                 priam

                   do you really think death frightens
                   me now? i watched my eldest son
                   die, watched you drag his body
                   behind your chariot.
      priam stares at achilles, and for the first time since
      we've known him, achilles looks away.

                                 priam

                   give him back to me. he deserves
                   the honor of a proper burial. you
                   know that. give him to me.

                                 achilles

                   he killed my cousin.

                                  priam

                   he thought it was you. he defended
                   his country. how many cousins have
                   you killed? how many sons and
                   fathers and brothers and husbands?
                   how many, brave achilles?
                           (beat)
                   i knew your father. he died before
                   his time. but he was lucky not to
                   live long enough to see his son
                   fall.
      achilles does not respond.     we cannot read his expression.

                                                    (continued)

                                  priam

                   you've taken everything from me.
                   my eldest son, heir to my throne,
                   defender of my kingdom.
                           (beat)
                   i can't change what happened. it's
                   the will of the gods. but give me
                   this small mercy.
      achilles looks into the old man's eyes.       priam tries to
      blink back his tears but fails.

                                  priam

                   i loved my boy from the moment he
                   opened his eyes till the moment you
                   closed them.
                           (beat)
                   let me wash his body. let me say
                   the prayers. let me place two
                   coins on his eyes for the boatman.

                                 achilles

                   if i let you walk out of here, if i
                   let you take him, it doesn't change
                   anything. you're still my enemy in
                   the morning.

                                 priam

                   you're still my enemy tonight.   but
                   even enemies can show respect.
      achilles nods.

                                 achilles

                   i admire your courage, old man.
                   you're a better king than the one
                   leading this army. meet me outside
                   in a moment.
