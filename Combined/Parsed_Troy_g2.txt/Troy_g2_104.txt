105    int. paris's bedchamber -night                                105

       paris flinches as helen, using needle and thread, stitches
       his leg wound. his face is bruised, his eyes red.

                                  paris

                    you think i'm a coward.
       helen, concentrating on her stitching, says nothing.
       paris flinches as the needle pierces his skin.

                                    paris

                    i am a coward.
                             (beat)
                    i knew he would kill me. i knew
                    it. you were watching, and my
                    father, my brother, all of troy --
                    it didn't matter. the shame didn't
                    matter.
                             (beat)
                    i gave up my pride, my honor. just
                    to live.

                                  helen

                    you challenged a great warrior.
                    that took courage.

                                  paris

                    i betrayed you.
       helen inspects her work. the black stitches are a little
       ragged, but they seem secure.

                                  helen

                    menelaus was brave. he lived for
                    fighting. and i hated him from the
                    day i married him until the day he
                    died.

      helen leans forward until her lips are inches from paris.

                                 helen

                   i don't want a hero, my love.    i
                   want a man to grow old with.
      she kisses him and there is great tenderness in her kiss.
      a knock on the door. helen looks up. another knock.

                                helen

                   come in.
      hector enters the room.     he examines paris's leg.

                                  hector

                           (to helen)
                   well stitched.
                           (to paris)
                   you have a talented woman.
                           (beat)
                   i thank the gods you're alive,
                   little brother.

                                 paris

                   i wanted to make you proud of me.
      he grips paris' shoulder.

                                hector

                   you will.
