187   int. palace of troy - subterranean level - night            187

      andromache leads the trojans to the bronze-banded door.
      she opens the door, revealing the dark tunnel.

                              andromache

                it's a long walk.
      helen and the others enter the tunnel.   paris does not.
      he stands just outside the door.

                              paris

                i stay.

                              helen

                no --

                              paris

                my father will never abandon the
                city. i can't leave him.

                              helen

                the city is dead! they're burning
                it to the ground!
      paris looks at the huddled refugees. they're a timid lot,
      terrified and weak. aeneas (14) looks stronger and braver
      than the rest. he's supporting his elderly father.

                              paris

                what's your name?

                              aeneas

                aeneas.

                              paris

                do you know how to use a sword?
      aeneas nods.   paris pulls out the sword of troy.

                                                   (continued)

                                  paris

                   the sword of troy. i wasn't so
                   good with it, but it's a fine
                   sword.
                           (beat)
                   as long as it's in a trojan's hand,
                   our people have a future.
                           (hands sword
                             to aeneas)
                   protect them, aeneas. find them a
                   new home.

                                  aeneas

                   i will.
      andromache touches paris's arm.

                                 andromache

                   briseis wasn't in her room.

                                  paris

                   i'll find her.
      andromache kisses him. she turns and leads the way
      through the tunnel. the trojans follow. aeneas bows to
      paris and helps his father as their long journey begins.

                                 helen

                   i'll stay with you.
      paris pushes her gently toward the door.

                                  paris

                   go.

                                 helen

                   don't leave me. please don't leave
                   me.

                                 paris

                   how could you love me if i ran now?

                                  helen

                   please    --

                                 paris

                   we will be together again. in this
                   world or the next, we will be
                   together.
      he kisses her hard, pushes her through the door and closes
      it. he kisses the wood, turns and runs toward the battle.




                                                          150.
