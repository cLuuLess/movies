167   ext. guard tower - dawn                                       167

      twelve days later.
      the sentries are at their posts, warming their hands over
      a brazier. the sky begins to lighten.
      sentry 1 stares down to the sea. he hurries to the edge
      of the tower and squints into the morning fog. sentry 2
      looks at him and then joins him.

                                   sentry 1

                   they're gone.
      it's true. all the greek ships are gone from the beach.
      all the tents have been struck, all the chariots taken
      away, every last man -- gone.
      nothing's left on the beach but a strange wooden
      structure.
