87    ext. battlefield - day                                      87

      the greek army halts just beyond arrow range. a
      delegation of kings -- agamemnon, nestor, menelaus,
      odysseus, and ajax -- on chariots proceeds to the center
      of the battlefield.
      odysseus looks over his shoulder and then yells to ajax.

                              odysseus

                where's achilles?
      ajax looks around and shrugs.

      hector and paris spur their horses and canter out to meet
      the greeks. the brothers speak without looking at each
      other.

                              hector

                menelaus is a bull. he'll charge
                you.
      paris nods.

                              hector

                he's stronger than you, so try not
                to fight him up close. keep your
                distance. use your quickness.
      paris leans over and tries to spit, but his mouth is too
      dry.

                              hector

                brother?
      paris, his face ashen, looks at hector.

                              hector

                you don't have to do this.

      paris shakes his head and continues riding toward
      menelaus.
