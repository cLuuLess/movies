                        (whispering in
                         briseis' ear)
                you'll be my slave in mycenae.    a
                trojan priestess scrubbing my
                floors. and at night --
      he tears her robe. briseis pulls her hand out of her
      sleeve. she's holding a ceremonial dagger.
      she drives the dagger into the side of agamemnon's neck.
      his eyes bulge. she rams the dagger deeper. agamemnon
      falls to the ground, clutching at his neck.

      the bodyguards stare at their dying king in disbelief.
      briseis runs. the bodyguards pursue her.
      briseis stumbles and falls. she looks behind her. one of
      the bodyguards raises his sword, ready to split briseis in
      half.
      before he can bring down his sword, his head flies from
      his shoulders. as the man falls, achilles whirls around
      and dispatches the other bodyguard, bronze sword
      glittering in the moonlight.
