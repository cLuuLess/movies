72   int. agamemnon's tent - continuous                          72




     the largest tent on the beach, agamemnon's command
     quarters are a lush affair, decorated with the spoils of a
     dozen wars. several aides-de-camp bustle in and out on
     various errands. the greek kings are here: odysseus,
     ajax, menelaus, etc.
     agamemnon sits on a heavy wood throne, garishly inlaid
     with gold, mother-of-pearl, and precious stones.
     triopas, king of thessaly, kneels before agamemnon.

                             triopas

               you've won a great victory, king of
               kings. no one thought the trojan
               beach could be captured so easily.
     he hands agamemnon a ceremonial dagger with a gold hilt.

                             agamemnon

               a beautiful gift, triopas. you
               will be among the first to walk the
               streets of troy tomorrow.
     triopas stands and bows.  achilles has watched this
     exchange with disbelief.  he glances at odysseus, who
     shrugs. now nestor, king  of the pylians, kneels before
     agamemnon and hands him an urn decorated with painted
     warriors.

                             nestor

               my father neleus had this urn made
               to commemorate his victory at
               cyparisseis. i present it to you
               in honor of an even more memorable
               victory.

                             agamemnon

               thank you, old friend. tomorrow
               we'll eat supper in the gardens of
               troy.
     nestor stands and bows. agamemnon places the dagger and
     urn beside a pile of other luxurious gifts. as the kings
     file out of the tent, odysseus clasps achilles' shoulder
     and speaks to him out of the others' earshot.

                             odysseus

               war is young men dying and old men
               talking. you know this. ignore
               the politics.

     odysseus exits the tent. agamemnon deigns to notice
     achilles waiting for him.

                                agamemnon

                          (to his aides)
                  leave us.
     the aides exit, leaving achilles and agamemnon alone.
     achilles eyes the pile of gifts.

                                achilles

                  apparently you've won some great
                  victory.

                                agamemnon

                  ah, perhaps you didn't notice. the
                  trojan beach belonged to priam in
                  the morning. it belongs to
                  agamemnon in the afternoon.

                                achilles

                  you can have the beach.   i didn't
                  come here for sand.

                                 agamemnon

                  no, you came because you want your
                  name to last through the ages.
                          (beat)
                  a great victory was won today --
                  but the victory is not yours.
                  kings did not kneel to achilles.
                  kings did not bring homage to
                  achilles.

                                achilles

                  the battle was won by soldiers.
                  the soldiers know who fought.

                                 agamemnon

                  history remembers the kings, not
                  the soldiers.
                          (beat)
                  tomorrow we'll batter down the
                  gates of troy. i'll build
                  monuments to victory on every
                  island of greece, and carve
                  agamemnon in the stone. my name
                  will last forever. your name is
                  written in the sand, for the waves
                  to wash away.

                                achilles

                  first you need the victory.

                                                     (continued)

     achilles turns to leave.

                                agamemnon

                  one more thing, son of peleus.



     achilles stops.

                                achilles

                  i don't want to hear my father's
                  name from your mouth.

                                agamemnon

                  the first pick of the battle's
                  spoils always goes to the
                  commander. your men sacked the
                  temple of apollo, yes?

                                 achilles

                  you want gold? take it, it's my
                  gift, to honor your courage. take
                  what you want.

                                agamemnon

                  i already have. aphareus!   haemon!
     two battle-scarred soldiers, aphareus and haemon, drag
     briseis into the tent. her face is bruised -- clearly
     she's been slapped around.

                                 agamemnon

                  the spoils of war. tonight i'll
                  have her give me a bath. and then
                   -- who knows?
     achilles draws his sword.

                                achilles

                          (to the soldiers)
                  i have no quarrel with you,
                  brothers. but you'll never see
                  home again if you don't let her go.
     the soldiers hesitate, then draw their own swords.
     achilles advances on them.

                               agamemnon

                  guards!
     the two sentries rush into the tent, swords drawn.
     achilles is surrounded. he raises his sword.

                                                     (continued)





                                                            66.

                                briseis

                  stop!
     everyone stops and looks at the girl. despite her torn
     robes, her noble bearing and authoritative tone command
     respect.

                                briseis

                  too many people have died today.
     she looks at the various men in the room and finally
     addresses achilles.

                                briseis

                  if killing is your only talent,
                  that's your curse. but i don't
                  want anyone dying for me.
     everyone is quiet until agamemnon laughs.

                                agamemnon

                  mighty achilles, silenced by a
                  slave girl.

                                achilles

                  she's not a slave.

                                agamemnon

                  she is now.
     achilles' eyes are flat and merciless.

                                achilles

                  before my time is done, king of
                  kings, i will look down on your
                  corpse and smile.
     achilles turns and leaves the tent.
