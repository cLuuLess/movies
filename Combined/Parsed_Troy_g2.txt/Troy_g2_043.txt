44   int. trojan armory - day                                          44

     the cavernous building is crowded with armaments: racks
     and racks of spears, swords, breastplates, and shields.
     hector watches as hundreds of male citizens rush into the
     armory and are issued weapons by trojan soldiers. the
     faces of the men reflect fear, excitement, and resolve.
     tecton approaches the prince and bows.

                                hector

                  the apollonian guard?

                                tecton

                  waiting at the city gates.

                                     hector

                  good.
     hector grabs the captain, lysander, overseeing arms
     distribution.

                                hector

                  how long before the army is ready?

                                      lsyander

                  half    our    men are still coming in
                  from    the    countryside. we have to
                  arm    them,    we have to match them
                  with    the    right officers --

                                     hector

                  how long?

                                                        (continued)





                                                              46.

                                lsyander

                          (taking a deep breath)
                  noon?




                                hector

                  make it sooner.
     we've never seen the prince in martial mode before. he
     looks different: eyes harder, mouth set and unsmiling.




                                hector

                  i want patrols to scour the
                  countryside. check every home,
                  every pasture. i want every trojan
                  brought inside the walls. if they
                  can't walk, carry them.
     lysander bows his head. hector walks swiftly away,
     followed by tecton. lysander and the other trojans watch
     their prince with silent respect. there is no doubt who
     leads the city.
