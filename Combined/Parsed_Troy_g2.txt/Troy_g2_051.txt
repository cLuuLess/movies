52   ext. agamemnon's ship - day                                  52

     agamemnon, menelaus, and nestor watch the battle from the
     prow of their ship. they're still half a mile away.

                                agamemnon

                          (in awe despite himself)
                  the man wants to die.
     we hear shouts of "achilles!" from the other ships, a
     great clamor as men bash the flats of their swords against
     their shields and cheer their hero on.
     agamemnon hears the cheering. he grits his teeth and
     glares at the distant achilles. nestor notices
     agamemnon's barely concealed fury. he speaks quietly, so
     no one else can hear.

                                nestor

                  give him his battle.   you'll take
                  the war.

                                agamemnon

                  give him too many battles and the
                  men will forget who's king.
