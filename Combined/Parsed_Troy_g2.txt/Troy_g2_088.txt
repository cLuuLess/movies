89   ext. battlefield - day                                     89




     hector and paris ride up to the greek kings. menelaus
     stares at paris, his fingers tapping the hilt of his
     sword. paris does not make eye contact.



     the kings step down from their chariots and the trojan
     princes dismount from their horses. both armies are lined
     up several hundred yards apart.
     agamemnon surveys the trojan army.

                             agamemnon

               i see you're not hiding behind your
               high walls. valiant of you. ill-
               advised, but valiant.

                             hector

               you come here uninvited.   go back
               to your ships. go home.

                             agamemnon

               we've come too far, prince hector.

                             menelaus

               prince? these are not princes.
               what son of a king would accept a
               man's hospitality, eat his food,
               drink his wine, and then steal his
               wife in the middle of the night?

                             paris

               the sun was shining when your wife
               left you.
     menelaus draws his sword.   he points it at the city walls.

                             menelaus

               she's up there watching, isn't she?
               good. i want her to watch you die.
     agamemnon places a hand on his brother's arm.

                             agamemnon

               not yet, brother.
     he makes a sweeping gesture, indicating his entire army.

                             agamemnon

               look around you, hector. i've
               brought all the warriors of greece
               to your shores.

                                                 (continued)

                                nestor

                  you can still save troy, young
                  prince.




                                agamemnon

                  i have two wishes. if you grant
                  them, no more of your people need
                  to die. first, give helen back to
                  my brother. second, troy must
                  submit to my command, to fight for
                  me whenever i call.

                                hector

                  you want me to look upon your army
                  and tremble. well, i see them. i
                  see fifty thousand men brought here
                  to fight for one man's greed.

                                agamemnon

                  be careful, boy. my mercy has
                  limits.

                                hector

                  i've seen the limits of your mercy.
                  and i tell you now that no son of
                  troy will ever submit to a foreign
                  ruler.

                                agamemnon

                  then every son of troy shall die.

                                paris

                  there is another way.
     everyone watches paris now.

                                paris

                          (to menelaus)
                  i love helen. i won't   give her up.
                  and neither will you.   so let's
                  fight our own battle.   let the
                  winner take helen home,  and that
                  will be the end of it.

                                agamemnon

                  a brave offer.  but not enough.
     menelaus pulls agamemnon aside and speaks to him out of
     the others' earshot.

                                menelaus

                  let me kill this little peacock.

                                                     (continued)





                                                                83.





89   continued:    (2)                                                89





                                agamemnon

                  i didn't come here for your pretty
                  wife. i came for troy.




                                 menelaus

                  and i came for my honor. his every
                  breath insults me.
                          (beat)
                  let me kill him. when he's lying
                  in the dust, give the signal to
                  attack. i'll have my revenge and
                  you'll have your city.
     agamemnon ponders the offer.        he nods.   they rejoin the
     others.

                                menelaus

                          (to paris)
                  i accept your challenge. and
                  tonight i'll drink to your bones.
     he walks over to his chariot and grabs his shield. hector
     helps paris into his helmet and speaks quietly to him.

                                hector

                  he doesn't have the stamina he once
                  did. make him swing and miss.
                  he'll tire.
     paris nods. he turns toward menelaus but quickly turns
     back and grabs hector's arm.

                                paris

                  hector!
     hector waits. paris opens his mouth but no words come
     out. he tries again.

                                paris

                  if i fall -- tell helen -- tell
                  her --

                                hector

                  i will.

                                paris

                  don't let menelaus hurt her.      make
                  him swear --

                                hector

                  think about your sword and his
                  sword. nothing else.

                                                       (continued)





                                                            84.





89    continued:    (3)                                           89




      hector hugs him close for a moment and releases him.
      paris walks toward the center of the field, where menelaus
      waits.







89a   paris's pov                                                 89a

      it's difficult to see from inside your bronze helmet.
      your peripheral vision is severely restricted, and the
      nose guard bisects your vision.
      your breathing sounds amplified, impossibly loud and half-
      panicked. but there's no turning back. menelaus stands
      in the center of the vast battlefield, patient and
      menacing, carving the air with lazy strokes of his sword.
      you look back and see hector. hector nods, trying to
      encourage you, but he looks worried. behind hector is the
      trojan army, twenty-five thousand silent men.
      behind the army is the city of troy. atop those walls,
      beneath that blue canopy, your father is watching, and the
      woman you love.
      you turn back to menelaus.    he's smiling at you.




89b   back to scene                                               89b

      menelaus charges at paris and swings mightily, trying to
      knock the prince's head from his shoulders. paris manages
      to duck beneath the flashing blade.
      menelaus fights with little art and great savagery,
      exploiting his superior strength. paris is quicker. he
      nearly surprises the bigger man with a fast sword thrust,
      but menelaus dominates the fight, hammering paris's shield
      with a furious barrage of blows.
      paris steps away and tries another thrust, but this time
      menelaus sidesteps and smashes paris in the jaw with the
      hilt of his sword, knocking the prince's helmet off.
      paris falls, blood leaking from his nose and mouth.
      hector, frustrated and powerless to help, tries to will
      his brother to victory.

                                 hector

                           (under his breath)
                   get up. get up.




                                                            85.

      ajax and odysseus, standing together, watch the bloodied
      prince. ajax looks disgusted, odysseus amused.

                              ajax

                this is the prince of troy? in
                salamis, the women fight better.

                              odysseus

                but they're not as pretty.
