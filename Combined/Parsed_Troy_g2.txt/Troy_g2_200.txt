201   ext. main square of troy - dawn                               201

      the greeks are victorious. the beautiful city of troy is
      a ruin. trojan prisoners are led off in chains. greek
      soldiers carry gold treasures from the lavish temples and
      palace.
      funeral pyres fill the square. one pyre, taller than the
      rest, rises in the center of the square. odysseus stands
      atop the highest pyre, staring down at the body of
      achilles.
      for a long time odysseus looks at the dead man's face. he
      knows the world will never see another achilles. finally
      he reaches inside his tunic, pulls out two coins, and
      places them over achilles' eyes.

                                 odysseus

                   find peace, my brother.
      odysseus climbs down from the pyre. a lieutenant hands
      him a torch and odysseus starts the fire. the dry wood
      quickly catches. black smokes rises toward the circling
      crows.
      close on odysseus as he watches his friend burn.
