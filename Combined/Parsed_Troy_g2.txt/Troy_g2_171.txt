172   ext. beach encampment - dusk                                172

      an abandoned dog lopes along the beach, stopping to sniff
      each greek corpse. finding one dead man he seems to
      recognize, the dog licks the cadaver's face.
      the "sore" on the dead face is licked clean. the sores
      are masterful forgeries, applied with squid ink and dried
      blood.
