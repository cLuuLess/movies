23   ext. seaside cliff - late afternoon                                23

     achilles stands in the ruins of an ivy-covered temple on a
     cliff above the sea, sparring with his cousin patroclus
     (17). both men wield wooden practice swords.
     patroclus is a talented, lean, flashy young fighter.         his
     sword whirls in the air like a thing alive.
     achilles, by contrast, is the apotheosis of the efficient
     combatant, wasting no energy, waiting for weakness.

     patroclus presses in on the attack.     achilles tilts his
     head to avoid one thrust, side-steps    to avoid another.
     spying a momentary opening he lunges    forward and taps
     patroclus' belly with the tip of his    wood sword.




                                achilles

                  you're getting fat, cousin.
     patroclus grins and relaunches his attack, sword spinning
     with blazing speed. achilles ducks beneath an arcing
     swing and sword-taps patroclus on the back.

                                achilles

                  fancy swordplay. the girls must be
                  impressed.
     patroclus grunts and charges in again. this time a
     genuine duel develops, featuring splendid repartee and
     parrying.

                                patroclus

                  a little nervous, aren't you?

                                achilles

                  terrified.
     achilles raises his right hand and patroclus lifts his
     sword to parry the blow -- but achilles no longer holds
     his sword in his right hand.
     sword in hisleft hand, achilles taps patroclus on the
     chest. patroclus stares down at the wood blade.

                                patroclus

                  you told me never to switch sword
                  hands.
     achilles rolls his head to loosen his neck.

                                achilles

                  by the time you know how to do it,
                  you won't be following my orders
                  anymore.
     achilles tosses aside the sparring sword. he cocks his
     head as if listening to some distant sound. patroclus,
     oblivious to the noise, practices his swordplay.
     achilles' foot curls around the wood shaft of one of the
     spears lying on the ground. in one impossibly fast
     motion, he flips the spear into the air with his foot,
     catches it, and throws in the opposite direction from
     where he was looking.

                                                   (continued)





                                                                29.

     the bronze warhead blazes between the temple's walls and
     drives into the trunk of an old fir.
     only now do we see odysseus, leading a black horse,
     standing inches from the quivering shaft of the spear
     blocking his path. he stares at the spear for a moment
     before ducking his head under the shaft and walking
     forward.

                                odysseus

                          (smiling)
                  your reputation for hospitality is
                  fast becoming legend.

                                 achilles

                  i don't like that smile, my friend.
                  it's the smile you smile when you
                  want me to fight in another war.
                          (beat)
                  patroclus, my cousin -- odysseus,
                  king of ithaca.

                                odysseus

                  patroclus, son of menoetius?
     the boy nods.       odysseus grips patroclus's shoulder.

                                odysseus

                  i knew your parents well.    i miss
                  them.
     patroclus nods again, looking at his feet.

                                odysseus

                  now you have this one watching over
                  you, eh? learning from achilles
                  himself -- every boy in greece must
                  be jealous.
                          (to achilles)
                  we need to talk.

                                achilles

                  tell me you're not here at
                  agamemnon's bidding.
     odysseus hesitates.       achilles shakes his head.

                                achilles

                  how many times have i done the
                  savage work for the king of kings?
                  and when has he ever shown me the
                  respect i've earned?

                                                     (continued)

                                odysseus

                  i'm not asking you to fight for
                  him. i'm asking you to fight for
                  the greeks.




                                achilles

                  why?   are the greeks tired of
                  fighting each other?

                                odysseus

                  for now.

                                achilles

                  the trojans never did anything to
                  me.

                                odysseus

                  they insulted greece.

                                achilles

                  they insulted one greek, a man who
                  couldn't hold on to his wife. what
                  business is that of mine?

                                odysseus

                  your business is war, my friend.

                                achilles

                          (angry)
                  is it? am i the whore of the
                  battlefield? can my sword be
                  bought and sold?
                          (beat; calmer)
                  i don't want to be remembered as a
                  tyrant's mercenary.

                                odysseus

                  forget agamemnon. fight for me.
                  my wife will feel much better if
                  she knows you're by my side. i'll
                  feel much better.

                                patroclus

                  is ajax going to fight in troy?

                                 odysseus

                  of course.   you've heard of ajax,
                  eh?

                                patroclus

                  they say he can fell an oak tree
                  with one swing of the axe.

                                                     (continued)

                                achilles

                  trees don't swing back.
     odysseus chuckles, but he's alert to the boy's enthusiasm.




                                odysseus

                  we're sending the largest fleet
                  that ever sailed -- a thousand
                  ships.

                                patroclus

                  a thousand ships! prince hector,
                  is he as good a warrior as they
                  say?

                                 odysseus

                  the best of all the trojans. some
                  say he's better than all the
                  greeks, too.
                          (beat)
                  even if your cousin doesn't come,
                  patroclus, i hope you'll join us.
                  we could use a strong arm like
                  yours.
     patroclus beams with pride and looks at his cousin.
     achilles wraps his arm around odysseus's shoulders and
     leans closer to the ithacan. the embrace is friendly, but
     there's no mistaking the power in achilles' grip.

                                achilles

                  play your tricks on me, if you'd
                  like. but leave my cousin out of
                  it.

                                odysseus

                  you have your sword, i have my
                  tricks. we play with the toys the
                  gods give us.
     odysseus goes back to his horse and mounts.

                                 odysseus

                  we sail for troy in three days.
                          (beat)
                  this war will never be forgotten.
                  nor will the heroes who fight in
                  it.
     patroclus, eager but frustrated, watches him ride away.




                                                          32.
