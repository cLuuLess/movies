     hundreds of arrows whistle    through the air. four of the
     myrmidons climbing down cry    out as arrows hit them; they
     tumble into the sea. other     arrows rip into the packed
     sand or zip harmlessly into    the water.

     shields above their heads, look to   achilles. achilles
     makes a hand signal. half his men    split off and run to
     the fortifications on their left,   howling like wolves as
     arrows rain down.
