                              achilles


      briseis! briseis!

      achilles scales the high wall surrounding the palace and
      jumps to the other side. he's spotted by an apollonian.
      the guard charges. achilles cracks him in the face with
      the hilt of his sword. the guard falls. achilles grabs
      him and hauls him to his feet, sword at his throat.

                               achilles

                briseis -- where is she?
                        (louder)
                where is she?!

                              apollonian #2

                i don't know... please, i have a
                son.
      achilles shoves him away.

                              achilles

                get him out of troy.
      the guard, stunned to find himself alive, finally runs.
      achilles rushes into the palace.
