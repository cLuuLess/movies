  200 ext. palace garden - continuous                                200

      achilles looks down at agamemnon's corpse, lying in
      puddled blood a few feet away. he looks back to briseis.

                                    achilles

                   come with me.
      before she can answer her eyes go wide.      she sees paris,
      in the upper garden, notching an arrow.

                                  achilles

                   come.   i'll protect you.
      paris pulls back the catgut string.      briseis screams:

                                    briseis

                   no!
      paris fires. briseis's scream distracts him -- the arrow
      sails off course, hitting achilles above his heel, tearing
      through the tendon. achilles staggers, turns, and sees
      paris.
      achilles snarls and heads for him. paris shoots again.
      achilles tries to dodge but the torn tendon in his heel
      slows him down. the arrow rips through his side.
      achilles keeps limping forward.

                                    briseis

                   stop!   paris!    stop!

                                                    (continued)





                                                           155.

    paris releases another arrow. now achilles doesn't even
    try to dodge. the arrow sinks deep into his chest.
    achilles keeps coming. he knows this is the end. a small
    smile crosses his face. he has waited for this moment his
    entire life. he marches toward his destiny.
    paris notches another arrow. his hands are shaking but he
    fires again. this one drills deep into achilles' belly.

                               briseis

                 stop!
    achilles keeps coming. paris reaches for another arrow.
    his quiver is empty. aeneas has his sword.
    the palace around     them is burning, lighting their faces.
    blood pours from     achilles' wounds. the arrow shafts stick
    out of him. any      other man would have already fallen. but
    he keeps coming,     relentless, his face a mask of grim
    purpose.
    briseis runs in front of her cousin paris and shields him
    with her body. achilles lifts his bloody sword.

                               briseis

                 no more.
    briseis does not move. for several seconds the great
    warrior and the young girl stare at each other.

                               briseis

                 no more killing.
    achilles looks at the seashell necklace she wears.

                               briseis

                 no more.
    achilles raises his sword and brings it down hard, burying
    its bronze blade in the soil of the garden.

                               achilles

                 no more.
    he reaches out and rubs the shells of her necklace.

                               achilles

                 my mother made this necklace.

                                                  (continued)

    he sinks to a sitting    position on the grass. he pulls the
    arrows out of his body    and tosses them aside. briseis
    sits beside him. she     cradles his head in her arms while
    all troy burns around    them.




                               achilles

                 you have to get out.

                               briseis

                 shh.

                               achilles

                 get out.
    she kisses his lips, running her fingers across his jaw.

                               briseis

                 there's no way out.
    achilles stares at paris.

                               achilles

                 there's always a way out for the
                 princes.
    paris tries to lift briseis to her feet but she refuses.

                               achilles

                 briseis.
    she leans closer. he's losing too much blood, his
    strength is fading, but he summons his remaining energy to
    speak.

                               achilles

                 i chose this night... but you will
                 see the sun again. i want you to
                 live.
    her face is full of sorrow and love. he touches her lips,
    his fingers trembling as his body fails. she kisses him.

                               achilles

                 live.
    she doesn't want to go but he pushes her gently away.
    finally she nods.

                               briseis

                 because of you.

                                                    (continued)





                                                             157.

      she turns and follows paris down the stairs toward escape.
      achilles watches her intently until he sees she's safely
      away. he takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.



      hordes of rampaging greeks storm the garden, burning
      anything that will burn, hollering their victory cries.
      achilles sits alone in the garden.     he shivers, hugging
      himself for warmth, waiting.
