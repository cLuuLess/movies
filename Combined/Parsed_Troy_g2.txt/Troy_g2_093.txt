      paris runs to hector, gasping for   breath, the blood
      pouring down his face and leg. he    falls to his knees
      before his older brother. hector    stares at paris and then
      at menelaus, who has stopped seven   feet from the princes.

                               menelaus

                 fight me, you coward! fight me!
      paris, unable to look at either man or speak, trembles by
      his brother's side. hector, completely at a loss, lays
      his hand on paris's head.

                               menelaus

                 we have a pact. fight!

      agamemnon signals for the driver of his chariot.

                               agamemnon

                 the trojans have violated the
                 agreement. we march.

      the driver nods. agamemnon hops onto the chariot and they
      ride toward the army to deliver the orders.

      hector looks from his brother to the enraged menelaus.

                                 menelaus

                   this is not honor. this is not
                   worthy of royalty.
      hector looks at his brother but paris is not looking at
      anybody. he gasps for breath, the blood streaming from
      his wounds. hector glances at the greek army, then back
      to paris.

                                 menelaus

                   if he doesn't fight, troy is
                   doomed.

                                 hector

                   paris.
      paris shakes his head, blood dripping from his nose.

                                 paris

                   no.   no.

                                 hector

                           (to menelaus)
                   the fight is over.

                                  menelaus

                   the fight is not over.    stand back,
                   prince hector.
      hector stares at the king, judging his intentions.

                                 menelaus

                   i'll kill him at your feet.    i
                   don't care.

                                 hector

                   he's my brother.
      menelaus charges, sword raised overhead. in one motion
      hector draws his own sword and plunges the point through
      menelaus's breastplate. menelaus's momentum carries him
      forward, until his breastplate touches the hilt of
      hector's sword.

      menelaus, eyes wide open, stares down at the blood which
      now begins rushing down his armor. he looks up at hector.
      hector pulls his blade out.      menelaus falls to the ground.

      agamemnon standing on his chariot in front of his army,
      sees his brother fall. for a moment the vast field is
      silent.
      agamemnon shouts. a wordless cry of rage, echoing from
      the greek lines to the walls of troy. he points toward
      hector.
      the entire greek army surges forward. hollering with a
      collective violence powerful enough to make the ground
      tremble, fifty thousand soldiers charge at hector.

      sees them coming. the ground he stands on trembles with
      the concussive force of greek feet and horses' hooves.

                   paris.
      paris still seems to be in a state of shock.

                                  hector

                             get up!
                   get up.
      the avalanche of greek infantry is getting closer. paris
      finally gets to his feet but runs in the wrong direction,
      toward the greeks.

                                 hector

                   paris!
      what seems to be a sprint to suicide turns out to be
      something different: paris grabs the fallen sword of troy
      from the ground, dangerously close to the charging greeks.
      he turns and dashes back to hector.      the princes mount.

      the greeks are almost upon them. brandishing their spears
      and screaming their war cries, all of them vie for the
      glory of felling the trojan princes.



      the closest greeks launch their spears. one whistles by
      hector's ear. he spurs his horse. the princes gallop
      toward the city.
