168   ext. beach encampment - day                                   168

      priam, paris, glaucus, archeptolemus, and velior, all on
      horseback, lead the apollonian guard onto the beach. the
      soldiers -- still wary of an ambush -- surround their
      leaders, protecting them from attack. the trojan leaders
      dismount.
      slowly they approach a wooden horse standing forty feet
      high.

      the beach is deserted save for the bones of burnt-out
      ships, a few stray arrows, the remnants of the camp fires,
      and corpses -- dozens of greek bodies scattered in the
      sands.



      each of the cadavers is covered with large black sores.
      the trojans inspect the bodies, keeping a wary distance.

                                   priam

                   plague.

                                 glaucus

                   don't get too close, my king.

                                 archeptolemus

                   this is the will of the gods.
      everyone turns to look at the high priest.

                              archeptolemus

      they desecrated the temple of apollo and apollo desecrated
      their flesh. the greeks could fight our swords and
      arrows, but they can't fight the god's plague.
      glaucus shakes his head and laughs.

                                 glaucus

                   they thought they'd come here and
                   sack our city in a day. and look
                   at them now, fleeing across the
                   aegean.
      priam stares up at the great horse.

                                   priam

                   what is this?

                                 archeptolemus

                   an offering to poseidon. the
                   greeks are praying for a safe
                   return home.

                                 glaucus

                   i hope the sea god spits on their
                   offering and lets them all drown at
                   the bottom of the sea.

                                 archeptolemus

                   this is a gift. we should bring it
                   to the temple of poseidon.
      all the men stare at the towering horse.

                                                    (continued)

                                 paris

                   i think we should burn it.

                                velior

                   burn it? my prince -- it's a gift
                   to the gods.

                                 glaucus

                   the prince is right. i'd burn all
                   of greece if i had a big enough
                   torch.

                                 archeptolemus

                   i warn you, good men. be careful
                   what you insult. our beloved
                   prince hector had sharp words for
                   the gods and a day later achilles'
                   sword cut him down.
      priam turns to look at the high priest.

                                 paris

                           (glaring at
                            archeptolemus)
                   burn it, father.
      archeptolemus ignores paris and speaks directly to priam.

                                 archeptolemus

                   forgive me, my king. i mean no
                   disrespect. but i don't want to
                   see any more princes of troy incur
                   the gods' wrath.
      all the men look at priam.     he stares at the massive
      horse.

                                 priam

                   i will not watch another son die.
