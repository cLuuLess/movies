22   ext. ithaca - day                                              22

     a lean, bearded shepherd (40) sits on a hillside looking
     over the ionian sea.
     beside him sits his faithful hunting dog, argos. they
     watch a troop of emissaries climb the steep hill. the
     emissaries are panting for breath by the time they reach
     the hilltop.

                                emissary #1

                  greetings, brother. we were told
                  king odysseus is here in the hills.

                                shepherd

                  odysseus? that old bastard drinks
                  my wine and never pays.

                                emissary #2

                  you ought to respect your king,
                  friend.

                                shepherd

                  respect him? i'd like to punch him
                  in the nose. he's always pawing at
                  my wife, trying to tear her clothes
                  off.
     the emissaries, embarrassed, begin walking away.       the
     shepherd watches them go.

                                                     (continued)

                                shepherd

                          (to argos the dog)
                  i hope agamemnon's generals are
                  smarter than his emissaries.



     emissary #1 turns to look at the shepherd.

                                emissary #1

                  what did you say?
     the shepherd scratches behind argos's ears.      the dog wags
     his tail happily.

                                shepherd

                  you want me to help you fight the
                  trojans.

                               emissary #1

                  you're --
     emissary #1 exchanges glances with his compatriots.
     they're confused. finally the chastened emissaries bow.

                                emissary #1

                  forgive us, king odysseus.
     odysseus stands and looks down at his dog.

                                odysseus

                  well, i'm going to miss my dog.

                                emissary #2

                  king agamemnon has a favor to ask
                  of you.
     odysseus smiles and rubs his dog's head.

                                odysseus

                  of course he does.
