152   ext. beach encampment - day                                 152

      achilles rides into camp. the greek soldiers gather round
      to stare at hector's body. achilles doesn't look at
      anyone. he unties the rope and hauls hector by hand
      across the sands.
      odysseus stands nearby, amongst the men. a few of the
      soldiers laugh, seeing the trojan prince laid low.

                              soldier 1

                he doesn't look so glorious now.
      odysseus turns and glares at the soldier, who shuts his
      mouth. odysseus walks away.
      achilles drags hector's body to his tent, dumps him there,
      and walks inside.
