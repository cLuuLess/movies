112   int. achilles' tent - later                                     112

      achilles lies on his back on a deer skin, sleeping.
      briseis kneels beside him. in the candlelight we see the
      glint of a bronze blade. she holds the knife near his
      throat.
      achilles open his eyes.

                                  achilles

                   go on.
      briseis holds the blade against his skin.

                                 achilles

                   nothing is easier.

                                 briseis

                   aren't you afraid?

                                                      (continued)

                                 achilles

                   every mortal dies. today or fifty
                   years from now, what does it matter
                   in the face of eternity?




                                 briseis

                   you'll kill more men if i don't
                   kill you.

                                   achilles

                   many of them.
      for several seconds she holds the knife to his throat.
      finally she puts it down.

                                 briseis

                   may apollo forgive me.
      achilles pulls her closer and they kiss.
      he slowly slides the robe off her shoulders. briseis --
      eyes closed, lips parted -- trembles as achilles unveils
      her. for a moment she hesitates but soon hesitation
      evaporates and she presses her body against his, kissing
      his throat, his chest, his hands.
      their hunger for each other is stronger than gods and
      nations.
