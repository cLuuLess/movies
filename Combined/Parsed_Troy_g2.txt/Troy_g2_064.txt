65   int. altar room - day                                       65




     hector finds the bodies of two priests. they lie on the
     stone floor, limbs splayed, throats slit.
     sitting atop the altar, half-hidden by the shadows, is
     achilles. he's a terrible sight to behold, splattered
     with blood, his bronze sword still dripping.

                              achilles

               you must be very brave or very
               stupid, to come after me alone.
                       (beat)
               you must be hector.
     hector stares at achilles a moment before kneeling by the
     dead priests' bodies.

                              achilles

               a private audience with the prince
               of troy. i'm flattered. do you
               know who i am?

                             hector

               these priests weren't armed.
     hector closes the eyes of the murdered priests. achilles
     jumps down from the altar and looks at the bodies.

                             achilles

               i didn't kill them. cutting old
               men's throats -- there's no honor
               in that.

                             hector

               honor?
                       (spits)
               children and fools fight for honor.
               i fight for my country.
     hector charges. achilles dances back, staying just out of
     reach. achilles looks relaxed, almost playful.

                             hector

               fight me.

                             achilles

               why kill you, prince of troy, with
               no one here to see you fall?
     achilles backs out of an archway opening onto the bright
     day outside. hector follows.




                                                        57.
