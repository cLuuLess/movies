155   int. achilles' tent - night                                   155




      achilles, now clean, sits in the center of the tent,
      sharpening his sword. briseis sits in a far corner.
      she's been crying for hours, her eyes red and swollen.




                              briseis

                you lost your cousin.     and now
                you've taken mine.
      achilles looks up at her.

                              briseis

                when does it end?
      achilles continues sharpening his sword.

                               achilles

                it never ends.
      briseis stares at him for a moment and leaves the tent.
      achilles quits his sharpening. now there is nothing but
      silence, nothing but a bronze sword for company.
