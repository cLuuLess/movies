     he finds polydora polishing the queen's jewelry.    menelaus
     grabs her arm roughly. she's terrified.

                                  menelaus

                  where is she?

                                  polydora

                  who, my king?
     menelaus draws his sword.

                                menelaus

                  i swear by the father of the gods
                  i'll gut you here if you don't tell
                  me.
     the handmaiden tries to speak but no words come out.
     fortunately for her, hippasus, (50), a royal advisor,
     enters the room at that moment followed by an old

     fisherman (65).


                                hippasus

                  she left with the trojans, my king.
     menelaus stares at hippasus, who swallows and gestures at
     the fisherman. the fisherman looks as if he'd rather be
     fishing.

                             hippasus

               the old man saw her board their
               ship.
     menelaus releases the handmaiden and stares at the
     fisherman.

                                  menelaus

                  the trojans?

     menelaus holds up his hand. the fisherman shuts up.
     everyone watches the king, waiting for an explosion, but
     the news -- strangely -- seems to focus him.

                                menelaus

                  get my ship ready.
