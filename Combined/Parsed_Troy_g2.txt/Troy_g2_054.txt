55    ext. ajax's ship - continuous                              55

      ajax's ship is one hundred yards from shore. legendary
      ajax (30) -- a huge man, brutally muscled, head shaved,
      face and body scarred -- stands in the prow, watching
      achilles.

                                 ajax

                   look at him, hogging all the glory.
      he walks over to his rowers, grabs an oarsmen on the front
      bench under the armpits and tosses him away. ajax sits,
      grabs the oar handle, and begins rowing maniacally, the
      veins in his massive arms bulging through the skin.

                                 ajax

                   row, you lazy whores, row!   greeks
                   are dying!
      the oarsmen redouble their efforts and the ship leaps over
      the waves toward the shore.
