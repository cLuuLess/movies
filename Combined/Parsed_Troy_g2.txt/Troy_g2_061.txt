62   ext. trojan beach - day                                      62

     an arrow sticks out of ajax's leg but he doesn't seem to
     notice it. he bulls forward, giant shield held in front,
     and slams into the trojan ranks.
     where achilles is all grace and speed, ajax is brute
     force. parrying his blows is useless: his battle axe
     splits bronze shields, bronze swords, bronze helmets.
     the sound of his axe carving through a breastplate and the
     man beneath the breastplate is like nothing else on earth.
     as ajax drops another trojan, he lifts his ax to the
     heavens.

                                ajax

                  i am ajax, breaker of stones,
                  widow-maker of salamis! look upon
                  me, trojans, and despair!
     the apollonians join the fight against the greeks. the
     guards are far better than the archers at hand-to-hand
     combat.
