158   ext. achilles' tent - moments later - night                     158

      achilles, carrying a torch and a white shroud, walks to
      the spot where hector's body lies. he crouches beside the
      dead prince. death has not robbed hector's face of its
      dignity.
      a small sand crab approaches the body and achilles shoos
      it away. he shoves the butt end of the torch into the
      sand.

      achilles rubs his eyes with his hand and takes several
      deep breaths. when he removes his hand, we see something
      remarkable: achilles' eyes are wet with tears.



      for a moment he seems unsure what to do. finally he
      begins wrapping the white sheet around hector's body.

                   we'll meet again soon.
