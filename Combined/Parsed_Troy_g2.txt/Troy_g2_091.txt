92    ext. battlefield - continuous                               92

      menelaus swings at the fallen prince but paris is able to
      block the blow with his shield and scramble to his feet.
      menelaus points to the sky. three crows circle above.

                               menelaus

                you see the crows?
                        (beat)
                they've never tasted a prince
                before.
      the spartan's mind games are working -- paris wears the
      face of a man who doesn't want to fight. he swings
      clumsily and menelaus manages to catch his wrist. the
      spartan grins and raises his sword for the kill.
      paris lashes out with his free hand, punching the spartan
      hard in the jaw. menelaus grunts and shoves the trojan
      away. he spits out a tooth. he's no longer smiling.

      exchange a quick glance: not bad.




                                                             86.





92b   menelaus                                                     92b




      but menelaus bores in again, blow after blow. finally his
      bronze blade bites into paris's thigh. paris staggers
      backward, blood flowing down his leg. he swings
      desperately but menelaus parries, knocking the sword from
      paris's hand.
      paris stares at his fallen sword, five feet away.
      paris runs.   menelaus snarls and chases after him.
