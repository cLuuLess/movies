80   ext. palace garden - continuous                             80

     hector runs into the garden. he's far faster. he seizes
     his quarry and pulls aside the fugitive's cowl. it's
     helen.

                                hector

                  helen?
     by the light of the moon he examines her face. the stress
     of recent weeks has taken its toll, but the shadows
     beneath her eyes make her face more compelling than ever.
     embarrassed by the awkwardness of their position, hector
     stands and helps helen to her feet.

                                hector

                  what are you doing out --

                                                  (continued)

     helen runs.     hector catches her again after a few strides.

                                  helen

                  let me go.




                                  hector

                  where?
     helen struggles against hector's grip, but it's useless.

                                  helen

                  let me go!
     helen, still struggling, begins to cry. hector pulls her
     to his chest. she cries for real now, violently sobbing,
     her mouth muffled against hector's body.

                                  hector

                  shh.   shh.

                                 helen

                  i saw them burn. i saw them
                  burning on the pyres.
                          (beat)
                  it's my fault.

                                  hector

                  no.

                               helen

                  it is. you know it is. all those
                  widows. i still hear them
                  screaming.
     helen takes a deep breath.       she manages to control
     herself.

                                helen

                  their husbands died because i'm
                  here.
     hector can't deny this.       helen pushes herself out of his
     grip.

                                helen

                  i'm going down to the ships.

                                  hector

                  no.    you're not.

                                                    (continued)

                                helen

                  i'll give myself back to menelaus.
                  he can do what he wants -- kill me,
                  make me his slave. anything's
                  better than this.

                                hector

                  it's too late for that. you think
                  agamemnon cares about his brother's
                  marriage? this is about power.
                  not love.

                                helen

                  paris is going to fight in the
                  morning.

                                hector

                  yes.

                                helen

                  menelaus will kill him.
     hector looks away, the words hurting him.

                                helen

                  i won't let that happen.

                                hector

                  it's his decision.

                                helen

                  no. no. i can't ask anyone to
                  fight for me. i'm no longer queen
                  of sparta.
     hector bows to helen and kisses her hand.

                                hector

                  you're a princess of troy.   and my
                  brother needs you tonight.
     helen stares at hector in wonder. the words seem to
     bolster her spirit, and she smiles though her eyes are
     still wet. she nods, touches his arm and goes back to the
     palace.
