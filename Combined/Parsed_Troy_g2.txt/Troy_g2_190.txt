191    int. palace - reception hall - night                        191




       outside we hear the screams and battle cries. glaucus
       stands with fifty of his men, the last line of defense.
       he walks through their ranks, clasping hands with each
       man.




                               glaucus

                 you men are soldiers.   leading you
                 has been an honor.
       paris runs into the hall. glaucus smiles and clasps hands
       with the prince. glaucus addresses the men.

                               glaucus

                 the boatman is waiting for us. i
                 say, let him wait a little longer!
       the men roar as the greeks spill into the reception hall.




191a   the trojans                                                 191a

       attack. for a few moments they drive the greeks back.
       paris notches an arrow and fires. a greek falls, an arrow
       through his throat.
       but too many greeks pour through the doors. the trojans
       fight bravely, especially paris, who fires quickly and
       accurately.
       odysseus engages glaucus and quickly kills the old
       general. the surviving trojans retreat farther into the
       palace.
