116   int. priam's meeting hall - morning                              116

      the notables we've seen in this room before -- priam,
      hector, glaucus, velior, archeptolemus -- are gathered
      again.

                                 archeptolemus

                   the omens are gathering. the
                   directive is clear.

                                 hector

                   fight for your country.   that's the
                   only directive.

                                  priam

                           (to hector)
                   the last time the high priest spoke
                   to us he prophesied a great victory
                   for troy. we won a great victory.
                   let him speak.
                           (to archeptolemus)
                   what course of action do you
                   recommend?

                                 archeptolemus

                   the gods favor our cause. now is
                   the time to destroy the greek army.

                                priam

                   glaucus?

                                                       (continued)





                                                          110.





116   continued:                                                 116





                                 glaucus

                   their morale is battered. hit them
                   now, hit them hard, and they will
                   run.




                                 velior

                   i must admit, i overestimated the
                   greeks. they lack discipline and
                   courage.
      hector, frustrated and weary, rubs his eyes.

                                  hector

                   the myrmidons did not fight
                   yesterday. there must be
                   dissension among the greeks. but
                   if we attack their ships, we'll
                   unify them.
                           (beat)
                   if they decide to attack, let them.
                   they can't breach our walls. we'll
                   beat them back again.
                           (beat; to priam)
                   yesterday the greeks underestimated
                   us. we should not return the favor
                   today.
      priam meditates on this conflicting advice. he stands and
      paces about the room. he turns to archeptolemus.

                                 priam

                   you're confident about the meaning
                   of these omens?

                                 archeptolemus

                   the desecration of his temple
                   angers apollo. the gods have
                   cursed the greeks. two of their
                   kings have already gone down to the
                   dust.
      priam continues pacing, hands clasped behind his back.

                                 priam

                   prepare the army. we attack at
                   noon.

                                 hector

                   we're making a mistake, father.
      father and son face each other across the long table.

                                 priam

                   prepare the army.




                                                           111.
