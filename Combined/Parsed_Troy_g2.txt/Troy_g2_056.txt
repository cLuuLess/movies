      achilles, his shield now quilled with arrows, hurls his
      spear. it catches the closest archer just above the
      breastplate, tearing through the man's throat.
      the archers near by throw down their bows and take up the
      spears racked behind them.

     but achilles is already upon them, cutting them down with
     ruthless precision. every time his bronze sword flashes
     through the air another trojan falls, and achilles keeps
     sweeping through them, his face painted with trojan blood.



     the other myrmidons are fighting beside their leader now,
     and the trojan archers are no match for the myrmidons in
     hand to hand combat. soon the temple area belongs to the
     greeks.
