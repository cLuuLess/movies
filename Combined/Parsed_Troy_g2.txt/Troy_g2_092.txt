93    ext. walls of troy - continuous                              93

      the citizens seem shocked that their prince and hero would
      flee before a greek assailant. they look at each other
      and whisper, glancing at priam, curious to see his
      reaction.

                               priam

                         (to himself)
                 fight him, son. fight him.
      helen stares at the battlefield, her face unreadable.
