166   ext. achilles' tent - later                                       166

      achilles arrives at his tent and finds eudorus polishing
      his armor. eudorus jumps to his feet.

                                 achilles

                   eudorus.
                           (beat)
                   forgive me.
      eudorus blinks. no one has ever heard these words from
      achilles' mouth before.

                                 achilles

                   i should never have struck you.
                   you've been a loyal friend all your
                   life.

                                 eudorus

                   i hope i never disappoint you
                   again.

                                 achilles

                   rouse the men.  you're taking them
                   home.

                                 eudorus

                   aren't you coming with us?

                                 achilles

                   i've got one more battle to fight.
      eudorus hesitates, watching his lord.        finally:

                                 eudorus

                   she's worth fighting for.    we'll
                   march behind you.

                                                        (continued)





                                                             141.

                                  achilles

                   all that's left is the slaughter.
                   i don't want to see my men fouled
                   with children's blood.
                           (beat)
                   go, eudorus. this is the last
                   order i give you.
      after a long pause, eudorus bows deeply to his commander.

                                 eudorus

                   fighting for you has been my life's
                   honor.
      achilles grips his lieutenant's shoulder and strides away.
