178    ext. troy - night                                            178

       all over the city, the greeks carry out their raids,
       killing sentries at their posts, setting buildings on fire
       with torches, opening the stable doors and shooing all the
       frightened horses into the streets.

       soon the city is in chaos. fires burn out of control.
       screams begin to echo down the alleyways, first just a
       few, then more and more, until it seems the entire city is
       screaming.
