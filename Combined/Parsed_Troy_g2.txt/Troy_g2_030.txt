30    int. priam's meeting hall - day                             30

      the camera glides down the long hall, past tall columns
      and marmoreal depictions of the olympians.

                                                            37.

     at the far end of the hall, priam stands by an open
     archway looking over the city. hector sits at a table
     that could seat fifty men.




                                 priam

                  it's the will of the gods.
                  everything is in their hands.
                          (beat)
                  but i'm surprised you let him bring
                  her.

                                hector

                  if i'd let him fight menelaus for
                  her, you'd be burning a son's body
                  instead of welcoming a daughter.
     priam closes his eyes at these words.

                                priam

                  we could send peace envoys to
                  menelaus.

                                hector

                  you know menelaus. he'd spear your
                  envoys' heads to his gate.

                                priam

                  what would you have me do?

                                hector

                  put her on a ship and send her
                  home.
     priam thinks for a moment, staring out at his city.

                                 priam

                  women have always loved   paris and
                  he's loved them back.
                          (beat)
                  but this is different.    something
                  has changed in him. if    we send her
                  back to menelaus, he'll   follow.
     hector stands and joins his father in the archway. he
     gestures outside. the city of troy teems with life, the
     citizens going about their business.

                                hector

                  this is my country. these are my
                  countrymen. i don't want to see
                  them suffer so my brother can have
                  his prize.

                                                             38.

                                 hector (cont'd)

                          (beat)
                  it's not just the spartans coming
                  after her. by now menelaus has
                  gone to agamemnon, and agamemnon's
                  wanted to destroy us for years.
                  once we're out of the way he
                  controls the seas.

                                priam

                  enemies have been attacking us for
                  centuries. our walls still stand.

                                hector

                  father.
                          (beat)
                  we can't win this war.

                                priam

                  apollo watches over us. even
                  agamemnon is no match for the gods.

                                hector

                  how many battalions does the sun
                  god command?

                                priam

                  don't mock the gods.
     hector opens his mouth to argue but holds his tongue.

                                priam

                  when you were very young you came
                  down with scarlet fever.
     hector nods impatiently.     he's heard this story before.

                                  priam

                  your little hands were so hot. the
                  healer said you wouldn't last the
                  night. i went down to apollo's
                  temple and i prayed until the sun
                  came up.
                           (beat)
                  that walk back to the palace was
                  the longest of my life. but i went
                  into your mother's room and you
                  were sleeping in her arms. the
                  fever had broken.
                           (beat)
                  i promised that day to dedicate my
                  life to the gods. i will not break
                  my promise.

                                                    (continued)





                                                              39.





30   continued:    (3)                                               30




     hector takes a deep breath.       he knows priam has decided.

                                 priam

                  for thirty years i've worked for
                  peace. thirty years.
                          (beat)
                  paris is a fool sometimes. i know
                  that. but i'll fight a thousand
                  wars before letting him die.
     hector looks past the city to the sea.       the waters are
     empty now, but he knows what's coming.

                                hector

                  forgive me, father. but you won't
                  be the one fighting.
     he bows and leaves the old king alone in the great hall.
