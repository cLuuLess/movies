29   ext. palace of troy                                           29

     at the bottom of a long staircase leading into the palace,
     four apollonian guards, wearing horsehair-plumed helmets,
     are mounted on beautiful white horses.

                                                 (continued)

     hector reunites with his wife, andromache (30), pale
     skinned and dark eyed. he holds her to his chest; she
     closes her eyes, and they stand like that for a long time.



     a nurse standing nearby holds hector's ten-month-old son,
     scamandrius. now andromache takes the baby from the
     nurse. hector stares into the boy's wondering eyes and
     puts his finger in the boy's hand.

                                hector

                  he has a good grip.

                                andromache

                  he's just like his father.   he even
                  hates peas.
     while this reunion is going on, paris embraces his father,
     priam (70), king of troy. priam is a regal-looking man
     with a shock of white hair and sharp blue eyes. he adores
     paris.

                                paris

                  father, this -- is helen.
     helen bows her head, paying respect.

                                priam

                  helen?   helen of sparta?
     both helen and priam now look at paris.

                                paris

                  helen of troy.
     if priam is disturbed by this revelation, his face doesn't
     betray it. he leans forward and kisses the former queen
     on both cheeks. helen didn't know what to expect -- she's
     flustered and gratified at the same time.

                                priam

                  i've heard rumors of your beauty.
                  for once, the gossips were right.
                  welcome.

                                helen

                  thank you, good king.

                                priam

                  come, you must be tired.
     he leads them up the stairs and into the palace.




                                                            36.





29a   int. entrance hall (palace of troy)                         29a







      briseis, a seventeen-year-old girl with an aristocratic
      demeanor, wearing the white robes of a temple acolyte,
      approaches the royal family. paris smiles when he sees
      her.

                              paris

                briseis! beloved cousin, your
                beauty grows with each new moon.
      briseis, cheeks flushing, dips her knees in deference.
      hector approaches her now, arms open. briseis's face
      lights up. she hugs the eldest prince. hector kisses the
      top of her head.

                              hector

                did you miss me, little swan?
      briseis nods.   hector pinches the sleeve of her robe.

                              hector

                a servant of apollo now?

                              priam

                the young men of troy were
                devastated when she chose the
                virgin robes.
      briseis' cheeks turn bright red.

                                briseis

                uncle.
      priam laughs and kisses the girl's forehead. he takes
      three goblets of wine from a servant holding a silver
      platter and hands them to hector and paris, keeping one
      for himself.

                              priam

                i thank the gods for your safe
                return.
      the king and the princes spill a few drops of wine.

                                priam, hector and paris

                for the gods!
      they drain their goblets.
