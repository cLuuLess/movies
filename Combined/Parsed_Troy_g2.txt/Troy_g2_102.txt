103   ext. beach encampment                                          103

      the greeks get back to their trenches, the bulk of the
      force still intact. archers in the greek rear guard,
      manning the trenches, now raise their bows and prepare to
      fire.
      hector, eager to avoid the mistakes his greek counterparts
      made earlier, holds up his hands and bellows to the
      troops.

                                hector

                   halt!
      the trojan army stops just outside the greek archers'
      range. lysander, the trojan captain, stands beside
      hector.

                                  lysander

                    we have them on the run, my prince.

                                   hector

                    we're almost in range of their
                    archers. you saw what our arrows
                    did to them.
                            (beat)
                    have the men gather our fallen.
                    when they're done, send an emissary
                    to the greeks. they can collect
                    their dead without fear of assault.

                                  lysander

                    would they have done the same for us?

                                  hector

                    of course not. that's why troy is
                    worth defending.
       hector turns and heads back to the white city.
