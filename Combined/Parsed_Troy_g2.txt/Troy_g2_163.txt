164   ext. main square of troy - night                             164

      a giant pyre has been built in the city square. thousands
      of citizens are gathered around to watch. no crowd has
      ever been more silent. the city has lost its favorite
      son.

      hector lies atop the pyre, dressed in a woven robe of
      white and gold, his hair washed and oiled, his skin
      gleaming and clean. his face is undamaged. two coins
      rest above his eyes.



      priam stands at the base of the pyre, holding a lit torch.
      his hand trembles. he is unable to light the pyre.
      finally paris grips his father's shoulder. paris takes
      the torch from priam and lights the kindling.
      helen, andromache, and baby scamandrius sit nearby.
      andromache's face is completely blank. she stares dully
      at the quickening fire. helen holds scamandrius in her
      lap. the boy plays with the wood lion his father made for
      him.
