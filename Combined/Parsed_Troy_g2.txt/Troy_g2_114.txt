115   ext. achilles' tent - continuous                               115

      odysseus waits for achilles outside the tent.

                                 achilles

                           (to eudorus)
                   have the men start loading the
                   ship. we're going home.



      eudorus, surprised, looks at odysseus for a second before
      bowing to his commander and walking away.

                                 odysseus

                   you found the girl?

                                  achilles

                   i found her.

                                  odysseus

                   is she hurt?

                                 achilles

                   not as badly as those who hurt her.
      achilles stares at the sea.     seagulls patrol the skies.

                                 achilles

                   do you miss your wife, odysseus?

                                  odysseus

                   always.

                                 achilles

                   i've never missed anyone in my
                   life. i used to think it was a
                   weakness, needing someone else.

                                 odysseus

                   we all need someone else.   right
                   now, greece needs you.

                                 achilles

                   greece got along fine before i was
                   born and greece will be greece long
                   after i'm dead.

                                 odysseus

                   i'm not talking about the land.
                   the valleys, the mountains -- they
                   don't care what we do. the men
                   need you. you should have seen the
                   slaughter yesterday.

                                 achilles

                   i saw it. and i saw who led the
                   men to slaughter.

                                 odysseus

                   agamemnon... is a proud man. but
                   he knows when he's made a mistake.




                                 achilles

                   the man sends you to make his
                   apologies? he doesn't understand
                   honor. what are you doing in
                   thrall to that pig of a king?

                                 odysseus

                   the world seems simple to you, my
                   friend. but when you're a king,
                   very few choices are simple.
                   ithaca cannot afford an enemy like
                   agamemnon.

                                 achilles

                   am i supposed to fear him?

                                  odysseus

                   you don't fear anyone, that's your
                   problem. fear is useful.
                           (beat)
                   stay, achilles. you were born for
                   this war.

                                 achilles

                   my life is war. is that what you
                   think?

                                 odysseus

                   am i wrong?
      achilles stares at the sea again.

                                 achilles

                   a week ago you were right. but
                   things are less simple today.

                                 odysseus

                   women have a way of complicating
                   things.
      achilles smiles.     he turns to odysseus and clasps his
      hand.

                                 achilles

                   of all the kings of greece, i
                   respect you most. but in this war
                   you're a servant. and i refuse to
                   be a servant any longer.

                                 odysseus

                   sometimes you need to serve in
                   order to lead. i hope you
                   understand that one day.



      odysseus walks away. achilles watches him go and then
      turns back toward his tent. he sees that patroclus has
      been standing by the tent throughout the previous
      conversation.

                                 patroclus

                   we're going home?

                                 achilles

                   we leave at noon.
      he tries to enter his tent but patroclus grabs his arm and
      blocks his path. achilles stares at patroclus' hand.
      patroclus releases him but doesn't move out of the way.

                                 patroclus

                   if poseidon curses us and our ship
                   goes down, what will i tell the
                   shades in hades? that i died
                   running from this war, abandoning
                   our countrymen?

                                 achilles

                   our countrymen?

                                  patroclus

                   yes, our country! we're greek,
                   cousin. i broke bread with these
                   men, i drank their wine, i listened
                   to their jokes. these are our
                   comrades. we cannot desert them.
                           (beat)
                   your feud with agamemnon is tearing
                   this army apart. and your
                   reputation suffers. the men are
                   talking --
      achilles' eyes narrow as his temper rises.

                                 achilles

                   if my blood wasn't in your
                   veins --

                                 patroclus

                   but your blood is in my veins.

                                  achilles

                   i gave you an order, cousin.   we
                   leave at noon.



      achilles opens the tent flap.

                                 patroclus

                   if you command us not to fight for
                   the king of kings, so be it. but
                   please don't ask me not to fight
                   for greece.
                           (long beat)
                   when the shades hear my name i want
                   them to know i led a worthy life.
      achilles, face inscrutable, watches his cousin walk away.
