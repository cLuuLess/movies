int. land rover
the tracker has just enough time to get a good look at
joe's furious expression before... wham!
joe throws his shoulder into the side of the land rover,
sending it tumbling end over end into a ravine.

disgusted with the guys' stupidity.

gregg
experienced trackers, my ass!
pindi shrugs.  the two of them watch as joe continues
running, then changes directions and starts heading
straight for them.  the humvee has to swerve out of the
way to avoid colliding with joe.
follow joe as he books across the meadow in the opposite
direction, now.  the modified land rover with the hot
seat attached to the hood swerves around and chases joe.
they catch up, and the tracker climbs into the hot seat,
readying a metal clamp attached to a chain...
gregg
tries to yell across at him.
gregg
no, we don't want to...
too late, the guy's slapped the clamp onto joe's arm.
joe roars, tries to shake off the chain, then speeds up.
the chain
unspools rapidly, whipping out from the front of the
modified land rover.  quickly, it grows taut and now the
rover is being pulled by joe.  the driver slams on the
brakes with both feet, but all that does is tilt the front
end upwards, digging up clods of dirt as they're dragged
along.
joe
feels the increased pull, and is starting to get annoyed.
he heads right for...
stand of trees
the guy in the hot seat is battered by branches and leaves
as they're dragged through the trees.
back on humvee
now circling around the stand of trees, trying to catch up
with joe when he emerges from the opposite side.
gregg
hold the wheel!
pindi
(terrified)
oh, sure.

gregg hands the wheel over to pindi as he reaches for
his dna gun...
their pov
joe has just emerged from the tree stand, dragging the
thoroughly-battered, modified land rover and its dazed
occupants.  joe sees the humvee heading towards him.
close on joe
his brow furrows.  is he coming up with a plan?  he makes
a ninety degree turn...
back on gregg
who is intently screwing a telescoping extension on the
dna plug gun.  pindi gapes at what gregg is doing.
pindi
i hope you are planning on
throwing that at him, because...
gregg
pindi!  look out!
pindi looks forward again just in time to see...
the chain
pulled taut between joe and the modified land rover, has
become a moving clothesline, and the humvee is heading
right into its path.  pindi tries to swerve, but they
can't avoid it.  he ducks and...
gregg leaps out of the car, hurdling the chain, just as...
it shears the top right off the vehicle!
gregg tumbles to the ground, as the humvee rolls to a stop
nearby.  meanwhile, the !! --
land rover
is spinning out, still connected to joe.  joe is almost
curious about the chain.  he begins to pull back as the
modified land rover circles him.  the modified land rover
bucks ! -- and for a second there is a standstill.  then joe
yanks...

and the chain, the winch, the tracker in the hot seat...
in fact, the entire axle of the modified land rover, are
pulled from their moorings.
the tracker racks up against a tree, followed closely by
his chair and winch...
the axle tumbles to a stop...
the land rover collapses like a stack of cards.
joe
stands at the edge of the field, observing his victory.
then he beats his chest and roars.
in meadow
pindi and his men run to the one remaining car, the
flatbed lorry.  they all pile in and speed away across
the field.  pindi sees something up ahead, yells at the
driver.
pindi
stop!
the lorry screeches to a halt, right next to gregg, who is
stumbling towards them.
pindi
hurry up, bro!  get in!
pindi watches as gregg stumbles around to the back of the
truck.  but instead of getting in, he grabs a silver case
and pulls it off.
pindi
excuse me, boss, but please, i
would like to avoid being killed.
gregg flips opens the case, revealing a video camera.  he
hoists it up, and barely able to walk, takes one last
look at pindi and the bruised and busted-up trackers.
gregg
get those men down the mountain.
they need help.
gregg takes off after joe.  pindi can't believe it.
pindi
crazy americans!

he slaps the driver on the shoulder.
pindi
get us out of here.
they peel out of there...
gregg's pov
staring down the path of crushed growth that joe has left
in his wake.  he takes a deep breath, then exhales.  then
he heads off into the jungle.
