ext. outdoor market - that moment

kweli and jill have a familial ease with each other as
they pick out their groceries.
kweli
our visitor must be feeling
better.  he should be leaving
the infirmary today.
jill looks up toward the infirmary and sees gregg leaning
against his truck, watching them.
jill
looks like he just has.

jill nods across the street.  kweli looks and sees that
gregg is leaning against his jeep, arms folded across
his chest, staring at them with a mixture of amusement
and irritation.
jill
he's walking so soon.  joe should
have dropped him harder.
kweli
he's not a poacher, jill.  he's
working for an animal conservancy
in california.
jill
(shrugs)
he can't be trusted.  he's an
outsider.
kweli
a grateful outsider.  he told me
he was saved yesterday by a woman.
(teasing jill)
a beautiful woman.
jill looks at kweli sharply, then back across the street
at gregg, whose eyes continue to assess her.  she looks
straight back at him, locking into his gaze.
jill
and what did you tell him?
kweli
what could i tell him?  he knows
what he saw. he's not a fool.
jill and gregg are still holding each other's eyes.
jill
i'll be the judge of that.
across the street, gregg is breaking into a big, slow
smile.  it unnerves jill.  kweli, always jill's
protector, catches the action between the two of them and
bristles a bit -- but jill has already turned her back
and taken off through the back of the market.
