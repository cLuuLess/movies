cecily clicks off her walkie-talkie, turns and yells to
anyone in earshot.
cecily
elvis is in the building!  i
repeat, elvis is in the building...
on her order, workers in matching conservancy uniforms
start moving into position around joe's habitat.
near observation area
a crane is lowering a platform into place that will
straddle the moat.  harry scowls, seemingly unable to
enjoy the moment.
cecily
you hear that, harry?
from around the conservancy, we can hear the sounds of
the other animals, screeching, snarling, bellowing...
cecily
they smell him.
harry
gregg, or the gorilla?
they both turn as...

conservancy car
pulls up right in front of them.  gregg gets out first.
harry
i'm confused, o'hara.  you phone
us to say you're bringing back a
two thousand pound wild animal...
gregg
hello, harry.  cecily.
cecily
(affectionate)
welcome back, baby.
harry
... but security tells me you've
requested no firehoses, no
restraints of any kind...
gregg
let me introduce you to...
harry
how are we supposed to control
the animal?  with a giant,
rolled-up...
harry trails off as jill gets out of the car.
harry
... newspaper?
harry wasn't prepared for somebody this young and
beautiful.  neither was cecily.  they raise their eyebrows
at gregg.
gregg
jill young, dr. harry ruben -- he
run the place -- and dr. cecily
banks, who makes sure he doesn't
screw it up.
cecily
(chuckles)
chief veterinarian.  hi.
jill steps forward, shy and polite.  she extends her hand.
jill

you both.

harry is too flustered by jill to say a word.  he just
manages a weird little smile and a sound that's not
english.
just then, a bang and a loud growl come out of the
trailer.  harry and cecily almost jump out of their skins.
jill
coming, joe!  hold on!
(to harry)
i think he'd like to come out
now -- if you don't mind.
harry
(stammering, scared)
mind?  no, of course i don't mind.
jill and gregg look at each other, excited.  this is the
moment they've been waiting for.  they grin at each other.
gregg
harry?  i think it's time you met
joe.
they start moving to the trailer...
harry
hold it!
harry whirls around and waves over a pair of nerdy, grad-
school-geek conservancy workers, jack and vern.  they run
eagerly forward to take orders.  they gawk at jill, each
one instantly deciding she is the woman of their dreams.
harry barks at them, bringing them back to attention.
harry
jack?  vern?  get the sedatives
ready.
jill
(quickly)
we won't need any of that.
harry
miss young, we know what we're
doing here, and the best way to...
gregg steps forward.
gregg
harry -- you and i made an
agreement.  the lady's in charge
of joe.
