ext. venice beach - night
69a
it's a beautiful and lively night on venice beach.
a few people have made bonfires along the water's
edge, and the music of a distant bar band wafts
through the air.  it's a magic night.
gregg and jill walk away from a funky food shack,
festooned with tiny lights.  they share a carton of
fish and chips.
jill
so this is what you call a good
meal in a fine restaurant?
gregg
(thinks about it)
yeah.
gregg grins at jill, all boyish charm.  she stiffles a
smile, struggling to hold on to her pervious indignation.
(continued)
70.

continued:

jill
don't point that smile at me.
i'm still mad at you for taking
off and leaving me here all alone.
gregg
(guilty)
i'm sorry -- i had things i had
to do...
jill
(doesn't buy it)
uh-huh...
gregg
besides, you weren't all alone.
you had joe.
jill nods at the truth of this.  she continues, almost
to herself:
jill
(softly)
that's right.  me and joe.  just
like always.
there is a lonliness about jill as she says this.  gregg
senses it.
gregg
growing up with him around --
what's it been like for you?
i mean -- most guys are afraid
of girls' fathers.  i can just
see a guy telling joe he'll get
you home by midnight...
jill
(shrugs)
never had anyone to bring home
anyway.  all that stuff -- i
don't even know what it's like.
gregg
all what 'stuff'?
jill
(defensive/dismissive)
whatever you want to call it.
being in love.
gregg
(smiles)
well -- it's kinda like getting
bit by a makiki spider.
(continued)

jill looks sharply at gregg.  not so fast.
jill
oh yeah?  how's that?
gregg
(stepping closer
 to jill)
you'll get a kind of a fever...
jill
fever?  really.  how high?
gregg
pretty high.
jill
interesting.  hallucinations
with that?
gregg
oh yeah... and you'll, uh -- find
yourself saying things.  lots of
things.
gregg is very close to jill.  he wants to kiss her right
now.  jill smiles.  she knows what he's doing.  maybe
she'll let gregg kiss her.
just then:
jill
aaah!
she pulls a beeper off her belt and checks the message.
insert - beeper readout
a message scrolls across that says, "get back here!
now!!!"
jill
come on!
jill and gregg bolt for the car.
