gregg has earphones on, plugged into a backpack with a
sony digital recorder, listening.  the sound is ambient
and mysterious.
pindi stands behind gregg, watching him carefully.
pindi
what are you listening to?
gregg
sounds.
pindi listens to the jungle.  it is full of sounds.
something small makes a rustling sound a few yards away.
pindi
like that right there?
gregg
yup.
pindi nods.

pindi
i understand completely:  jungle
sounds!  very important.  i know a
guy, he can get you a c.d. of
jungle sounds, cheap.  even
cheaper if you buy ten.
gregg puts his hand up to signal for quiet.
he hears something.
he listens intently for a moment, then the whoosh of a
spring trap blasts his ears, followed by shouts and the
sound of an animal screeching.  gregg throws off the
headphones, grabs a strange-looking pole called a dna
plug gun, and crashes with pindi through the woods.
gregg runs into frame to see several of pindi's men
closing the cage on a lithe, young leopard.
pindi
(beaming)
how do you like that, boss?  i
told you these men were the best.
gregg kneels to inspect the leopard.  he finds it
beautiful -- his face softens at the sight of it.
gregg
(soothing, to leopard)
you're a beauty.
carefully, he extends the dna plug gun and pricks the cat,
startling it and causing all the men to jump.
gregg
(stands)
okay, set him free.
gregg and pindi stand over the leopard.  pindi offers his
ersatz smile.
pindi
(testing the water)
why ask for a cage if you are not
keeping the animal?
gregg releases the vial of blood from the dna gun.
gregg
because i'm only keeping this.

pindi
yes, but i know a guy, in botswana,
he'd pay you ten thousand american
dollars for that leopard.  i'd be
willing to split with you --
fifty/fifty.
greg ignores pindi.  he's busy transferring the vial to a
container.  pindi presses on.
pindi
perhaps you're right.  sixty to
you, forty to me.  that's a very
fair deal!
still no response from gregg -- he's logging notes into a
book.
pindi
my goodness -- you're an
excellent negotiator.  okay,
boss!  seventy/thirty it is.

(to his men)
take him to the truck.
the men bend over and hoist the cage up -- but now gregg
blocks their way.
gregg
put the cat down... now.
gregg is one scary-looking bastard.  the men drop the
cage.  pindi back-pedals.
pindi
("angry," to his
 men)
you heard him... put it down!
(to gregg)
they never understand me.  i
don't know what to do...
pindi stops abruptly as his yammering is interrupted by
the leopard, growling.
sound cue:  a low rumble.
floating on the wind like distant thunder.  it seems to
come as an answer to the young leopard's cry.  birds fly
out of the trees above the cage.  the men are spooked.

gregg
quickly puts on his headphones and listens to the
amplified sound again.  high-pitched screams -- then
the rhythmic rondo of sharp pok-pok-pok-pok chestbeats.
pindi is on the verge of panic.  he forces his trademark
smile.
pindi
uh, excuse me.  time to flee,
right?
pov - trees
the top branches suddenly shake violently -- sending a
sharp wooden rattle across the meadow.  is that a shadow
from a passing cloud that seems to ripple through the
foliage?  gregg steps closer.  the trees bend like the
wake of a boat -- they bend in a straight line.
something powerful and unseen is moving through the
trees.
pindi and his men retreat back in the meadow.  gregg
scans the forest.  branches spring with a loud whoosh!
gregg can't help it -- his fear takes over and he
backsteps into the meadow.
widen shot up to the trees.  catapulting down through
frame -- landing right in front of them is a gorilla --
nearly 15 feet high.  the ground trembles from the force.
a nearby land rover bounces two feet into the air from the
impact.
his canines are fully exposed.  thick, black hair on his
crest stand erect.  deep brown eyes aglow as he gives
another deafening call.  this is joe.  backlit by the sun
he seems to encompass the forest.
push in close on gregg's reaction.  in complete awe.
gregg
don't anybody move.
pindi
(frightened out
 of his wits)
how about... i move... just over
here...

pindi scurries for cover behind the frozen, awe-
stricken trackers.
angle - joe
moves to the cage and peers inside.  the leopard paces and
hisses.  joe straightens up bi-pedally and pounds his
massive chest with his fist.  the hollow pok-pok-pok echoes
off the mountain.
joe raises his hand again and smashes the top off the
cage, as if it were made of matchsticks.  the leopard
leaps out of the cage and dashes safely into the forest.
joe bares his teeth and roars at gregg, as if to say
"stay off my mountain."  his mission accomplished, joe
quickly turns and starts back for tree cover.
silence.  everyone is open-mouthed, unable to believe
what they have just seen...
then greg snaps out of it.  bursting into action, he runs
to the humvee, motions to pindi.
gregg
come on!!  we're going after him!
pindi
what is this 'we'?  there is no
way my men will ever agree to...
gregg yells to the paralyzed trackers:
gregg
(in swahili)
three times your price.
(in english)
triple your fee.
that's what it's all about.  the men get a move on,
running for the vehicles as fast as they can.
engines rev, doors slam, as the trackers ready for the
chase.  all four cars pull out.
