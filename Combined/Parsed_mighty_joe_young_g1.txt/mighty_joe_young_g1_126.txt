fire
is really starting to burn out of control now.  it has
spread to the engine of the ferris wheel, which, heated
to the bursting point, suddenly explodes.
the ride operator with the fire extinguisher is blown
through the air, and the ferris wheel lurches to a halt.
jenny and emma
grip their safety bar as their bucket swings back and
forth.  emma nearly falls out -- until jenny grabs her
and holds her tight.
jenny
mo-om!!
jenny's mother
oh my god!  somebody help!
gregg -- sees the girls, their bucket having come to a
stop about fifteen feet off the ground.  thinking
quickly, he jumps up on the guard railing, then leaps
across to their bucket.
he just grabs onto the bottom.  the bucket shakes back
and forth violently, causing the two girls to scream.
gregg looks up at them.
gregg
don't be scared.  climb down my
back.
the girls look at gregg, too nervous to move.
gregg
come on.
tentatively, jenny and emma climb out of their bucket and
onto gregg's back, using him like a human ladder.  they
shimmy down to his feet, then drop off, one by one, into
the waiting arms of their mother.
gregg lets go of the bucket, drops a good fifteen feet,
landing roughly.  the girls' mother looks down at gregg,
thankfully.
jenny's mother
thank you!  oh god, thank you!
gregg, winded, just nods.
