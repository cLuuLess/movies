a poacher's truck, carrying six rowdy poachers, speeds
down the main street, kicking up a cloud of dust.  the
dust cloud envelops gregg, making him cough as he repacks
some of the damaged equipment in his truck.

he hears more coughing behind him and turns to find jill
at his shoulder.  she has a troubled air about her --
clearly she is wrestling with something.
jill
leaving?
gregg nods, continuing packing.
gregg
i'm gonna head up the mountain.
see if i can throw some of the
poachers off the trail.
jill
(dubious)
you think it will work?
gregg
not for long.  just trying to buy
you a little time, that's all.
with more of these bastards
arriving every hour, i suggest you
get joe as deep into the jungle as
you can -- as fast as you can.
across the street at the bar, a chorus of cackles rises
from a group of drunken poachers.  the mere sound of them
makes jill dig her fingers into her arms with anxiety.
she looks across at the poachers -- and then back to
gregg, packing up.  if she doesn't say this right now,
this second, she never will.  she snaps.
jill
okay!
gregg
okay what?
jill
okay we'll go.
gregg turns and looks at her.
gregg
we?
jill
me and joe.  to that place of
yours in california.
(off gregg's look)
what?!  you didn't think you could
take him without me, did you?

gregg stops packing to look squarely at jill.
gregg
you're sure about this?
jill
no.  i am completely unsure about
this.  but i'll do it.  on one
condition.
gregg
name it.
jill
i'm in charge of joe.
gregg
done.
jill
(suspicious)
done?  just like that?  that was
way too easy.
gregg
you're not a very trusting soul
are you, miss young?
jill
no, i'm not.
gregg
(sarcastic)
tough, isn't it?  trying to measure
me up -- decide if i'm a fraud...
jill
... or a fool.
gregg smiles, half sour, half amused.
gregg
well, i'd like to know if you're
a bona fide lunatic or just a
mixed up monkey girl but -- but i
guess we'll have to take our
chances and figure it out as we go
along.
jill snorts.  gregg looks her straight in the eye.

gregg
come on, jill.  trust it.  you'll
be in charge of joe.
(extends hand)
let's shake on it.
jill
i don't shake.  that's not how we
make pacts around here.
gregg
(growing impatient)
alright, how do you make pacts
around here?
jill
you have to endure a bite from a
makiki spider.
gregg
a what?
jill
you'll have a high fever and
hallucinations.  you'll say
things -- lots of things.  we'll
hear what's in your heart.  then,
if your intentions prove true, the
pact is made.
gregg nods to himself, considering.
gregg
a spider bite and hallucinations?
jill
that's right.
gregg
then you'll trust me and let me
have joe?
jill
that's right.  well?
gregg cocks his head.
gregg
well... i think... that's the
biggest load of crap i've ever
heard.
jill smiles.  she's satisfied.  this is the answer she
was looking for.

jill
good.  maybe you're not a fool
after all.
gregg scoffs, realizing she was only testing him.  jill
turns and starts walking away.  gregg calls after her.
gregg
get your things together.  fast.
we're getting out of here as soon
as we can.
gregg watches her go, head held high like a queen.  he
chuckles to himself.  it's hard not to appreciate this
girl.
gregg
(to himself)
makiki spider.
