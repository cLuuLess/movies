gregg and cecily walk back through the conservancy.
cecily
(wry)
how many minutes do you give it
before the whole world knows he's
missing?
gregg
five.  how many minutes do you give
it before we're both lookin' through
the want ads?
cecily
six.
they smile warmly at each other, respecting the sacrifice
they've both just made.

just then, vern and jack drive up in a blazer.  they stop
next to gregg and cecily.
gregg
what're you guys doing here
so late?
jack and vern hop out of the car.  vern is carrying a
cardboard box.
jack
baker wants the tent cleaned
up a.s.a.p.
vern holds out the box.
vern
check out the loot we plundered
in the wake of mass party panic!
this is some weird lost and
found, man.
vern pulls a single high-heeled shoe out of the box and
hands it to cecily.
jack
yeah, and we've got the fun job
of getting this stuff back to
everybody.
(pulls out a
 toupee)
somebody's head is cold!
digging in the box again, vern innocently pulls out the
poacher's dog collar.  it means nothing to him, but
gregg instantly grabs for it.
gregg
(alarmed)
where did you find this?
vern
oh -- that was by the habitat.
(to jack)
guess we've got to find those
two guys again.
gregg
(urgent)
what two guys?
(continued)

continued:  (2)

jack
that, uh...
(to vern)
what do you think that one guy
is?  russian?  lithuanian?
it takes less than a second.  gregg springs into action,
grabbing the keys to the blazer out of jack's hand.  he
sprints to the car.  jack and vern watch him go.
cecily
(calling after him)
be careful!
they watch him go.
