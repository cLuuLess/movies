back to scene
garth puts his hand on the barrel of the gun and pulls it
away from strasser's eye.  he's so nervous he's almost
chuckling.
garth
(very nervous)
hold on, now ! -- just who are
you aiming at?
strasser looks at garth with deadly focus.  his eyes tell
the story.  garth realizes his boss's intentions with
horror.

garth
no.  you can't do that.
strasser
if that girl starts telling
people who we really are, our
whole cover operation will be
blown.
strasser aims his rifle again.
garth
she's not an animal.  that's a
human being you're about to
kill.
strasser fixes garth with an icy stare.
strasser
go wait in the car.
he raises the gun again, gets the sight lined up just as
gregg and jill pass near the klieg light.  garth grabs
the gun, just as strasser is about to pull the trigger.
