int. cab of conservancy truck - night

jill glances nervously back as they drive down surface
streets.  she looks over at strasser.  in the passing
light of the street lamps, he is regaining his sinister
sheen.
garth is driving the trailer very fast.  they hit a
bump, making them lurch in their seat.  jill hears joe
go thud in the trailer.
jill
please!  be careful...
strasser
always worrying, eh?  your mother
was a worrier, too.  always
worrying about the gorillas.  it
made her a lot of enemies.  it led
to tragedy.
his tone has something vaguely malevolent in it.  it
rankles jill.
jill
my mother was brave.
strasser
so are you, my dear.
jill looks at strasser sharply.  for the first time, she
really notices his strange, leather hand.  for reasons
she's not yet conscious of, it scares her.
strasser notices that jill is staring at his hand.

strasser
it's not so pretty, i know.
jill
(looking away)
i'm sorry.
(beat)
what happened?
strasser and garth exchange amused glances.
strasser
well... you could say i had an
encounter with a monster.
(in roumanian)
monstrule.
strasser and garth chuckle -- they think they're just
sharing a private joke.
but jill has a troubled look in her eyes -- the foreign
epithet has struck a chord from long ago... she struggles
to remember...
then she gets it.  she sees herself crouching in the
forest with joe over 12 years ago, overhearing strasser's
curses, and her blood runs cold.  she glances at
strasser, everything dawning on her at once.  the hand...
the face... it all comes together for jill.
strasser catches the look on jill's face and knows some-
thing is wrong.  adrenaline is pumping through her.
unsure of how to make her next move, jill tries to hide
the realization that is crashing down on her...
she glances in the side view mirror of the truck and
sees:
gregg, driving up behind them in the conservancy vehicle.
jill's face reacts ever so slightly, but strasser catches
it.  he follows her eye line, looking where she looked,
and as he also spots gregg, jill knows the game is up.
she loses it and screams:
jill
murdering bastard!
jill slams her elbow into strasser's nose.  strasser's
face reflexively goes down in his hands.  stunned, garth
swerves at the wheel.  fast as lightning, jill grabs his
hair and slams his face into the dash.
before the men can recover, jill kicks and claws her way
over strasser's back, fighting toward the open window...

she reaches through the window and grabs onto the side
view mirror.  the truck door swings open and jill sails
out the door, dangling from her hold on the side view.
the speeding truck swerves wildly, banging jill again and
again against the door.
gregg sees her and is horrified at the danger.  he speeds
up, trying to reach her...
strasser grabs for jill, trying to pull her back into the
truck... she kicks at him and loses her grasp on the side
view mirror.
