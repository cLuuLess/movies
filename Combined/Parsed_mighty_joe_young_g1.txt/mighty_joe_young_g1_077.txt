ext. conservancy grounds - continuous action
74
jill storms out of baker's office stewing, head down.
she's walking so fast that she collides into a man coming
the other way.
jill
oh!  excuse me.
the man rights himself and smiles politely.
strasser
no, excuse me.  my fault.
it's strasser.  he's tamed his looks and dressed himself
in modest attire.  with his damaged hand concealed in his
pocket and a pleasant smile arranged on his face, he has
re-invented himself.  he comes across like a friendly
conservationist.
he stares openly at jill.  it flusters her.
strasser
(feigning surprise)
i'm so sorry -- it's just -- you
must be jill young...
jill
yes...?
strasser
("moved")
and -- you look just like her.
the words electrify jill.  she almost gasps.
strasser
i'm andre strasser.  an old friend
of your mother's.
(warmly)
i knew her when she was only a
little older than you, and you
were just a tiny thing.  what an
incredible woman she was.

jill is overwhelmed.  she immediately melts.  she reaches
her hand out to him.
jill
how wonderful to meet you.  what
are you doing here?
strasser pretends to look uncomfortable.
strasser
i've come to talk with your mr.
baker.
(pained)
you see, i am here for joe.  and,
in a way, for your mother, too.
(passionate)
i believe she would agree with
me -- a magnificent wild animal
like joe needs more space -- like
the raha preserve i run in botswana.
bingo.  jill's face falls.  the guilt is working already.
jill
raha?  a preserve?
strasser
i have twenty thousand acres there
where the animals are free to run.
i would like to offer them to joe.
(sighs)
here, it's such a shame... to see
joe living in a man-made habitat
and being used as an attraction
to raise money...
strasser shakes his head at the inhumanity of it all.
his clever words work on jill like a charm -- she looks
absolutely crestfallen.  he pretends to comfort her.
strasser
oh -- i've upset you!  please... i
only mean to offer an alternative.
i will be attending the event
tomorrow night.  maybe we can talk
more about this matter then.
jill
i'll look forward to it.
strasser
good-bye.
strasser walks off, leaving jill deep in thought.  he
smiles to himself, certain he's landed a direct hit.
