int. tent - night

at the podium, baker is making his presentation to the
tony crowd.
baker
... and now to introduce our
remarkable new acquisition, i would
like to bring up to the podium the
director of the conservancy...
a sudden roar coming from behind the curtain drowns out
baker's voice.  the audience members jump in their seats,
frightened.  baker is rattled, too, then regains his
composure.
baker
well!  i suppose there's no need
to add to that introduction.
the audience laughs and relaxes.
baker
here's dr. harry ruben.
baker motions to harry, who freezes with a sudden bout of
stage fright.  cecily gives him a discreet push on the
back and he stumbles forward.
joe can still be heard growling and beating his chest in
the background.  jill and gregg look at each other with
mounting anxiety.
harry reaches the mic.
harry
(into mic)
in the time it took you to
drive here tonight, three species
have disappeared from the earth.
extinct.  never to return.  we
here at the conservancy say this
is a tragedy...
another o.s. roar from joe.  it is spine-tingling.  harry
almost jumps out of his loafers.
harry
(nervous joke)
obviously joe agrees.
everybody laughs.  the audience doesn't know enough to
be really afraid -- they're just excited and twittering.

jill is feeling increasingly nervous.  she glances around
the room and meets eyes with strasser.  he nods at her,
his eyes indicating that he is "worried" for joe as well.
jill nods back.
we continue to hear uncanny sounds from behind the curtain.
it's all harry can do to stick to his speech.  he keeps
glancing nervously over his shoulder.
harry
but tonight, rather than focusing
on what we've lost, i'm going to
introduce you to something we've
found.
there is a tremendous cracking sound from behind the
curtain.  the audience murmurs.  harry sweats.  jill
grabs gregg's hand tightly.
harry
ladies and gentlemen, the
california animal conservancy
proudly introduces our newest
member, mighty joe...
crash!  before harry can say "young," a tree comes
crashing through the curtain.
gregg leaps forward, knocking harry out of the way just
as the tree crushes the podium into kindling.
joe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain.  he
has joined the party.
joe stands on the stage, his chest heaving.  there is
total silence.  the party guests are frozen with fear,
literally speechless.  a few of them laugh nervously,
wondering if this is really just part of the show.
but jill knows better.  she and gregg exchange glances
-- what the hell is going on?
jill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly
approaches joe, speaking in a soothing voice.  she
wants to get his attention.
jill
(soothing)
hey, joe.  i'm right here.  you hear
me?  good boy.  take it easy, joe.  we
don't want to scare anybody, do we?

jill is within arm's reach of joe -- it looks like he
might turn his head to her, calm down, become docile...
but that's when he spots strasser.  joe's face registers
towering rage as strasser stares back, provoking joe
further.
joe takes off, knocking over a table that bangs into jill
and sends her flying backwards into a wall.  she hits the
wall and sinks down, stunned.
joe
heads through the people towards strasser.  the party
erupts with screams.
joe makes his way towards strasser, swatting people out
of the way.
on strasser
frozen, in horror, as joe plows through the party, heading
straight for him.  tables are broken like match sticks,
glass shatters.
joe catches up to strasser, grabs his tuxedo jacket and
hoists him into the air.
close on man
it's not strasser.  frustrated, joe flings him aside.  the
man flies through the air, slamming into the tent wall,
and then falling on the catering table.
on gregg and jill
as they watch joe's rampage in horror.
jill
my god.  what's wrong with him?
gregg
we've got to bring him down.  i'm
going for the tranq guns.
jill
no -- let me stop him.

but gregg's already taken off.
meanwhile
mighty joe is still looking for strasser, as he heads
back across the room.
a glamorous couple, (terry and ray), crawls frantically
on all fours, trying to stay ahead of joe.
terry
(frantic)
faster!  faster!
ray
i'm trying!
jill
is pushing against the tide of people to get to joe.
somebody shoves against her hard:  it's baker, in a
panic to get away.
joe
continues to make his way towards strasser.  as he rushes
towards him...
a security guard runs into the tent, raising his tranq gun
and fires...
the dart misses, hitting a fleeing guest, who, we see as
he crumples to the ground, is actually baker.
strasser
is fleeing for the exit.
joe
chases him through the tent.  a guest falls in joe's path
and joe heedlessly steps on his leg, crushing it.  the man
screams in agony.

jill
is scrambling over broken tables and chairs to get to joe,
when he turns sharply away from her.
back to scene
strasser is trapped behind a table.  joe throws the
table out of his way, roars and is about to crush a
cowering strasser into poacher mulch, when...
sfx:  the explosion of a rifle.  joe looks surprised at
first.
joe drops to all fours, revealing gregg holding a tranq
gun.  other animal control officers are with him, also
holding tranq rifles.
gregg lowers his gun, a pained expression on his face.
but one tranq dart is not enough to stop mighty joe.  he
rises again, ready to smash strasser...
and a hail of tranq darts sail through the air as the
conservancy workers pepper joe with shots.
joe swipes several darts from his flank -- but the
accumulation is too much even for him.  he stumbles
backward and falls.
jill screams.  gregg looks sick at the sight of joe
falling.
joe hits the ground hard.  his eyes close.
fade to black.
