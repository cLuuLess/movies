strasser, extremely pissed off, turns to look at garth.
strasser
that was very stupid, garth.
garth
you're not a hunter, you're a
murderer, and i won't be a
part of this...
strasser flips the gun and cracks garth squarely in the
head with the rifle butt.
garth hits the ground like a bag of sand.
strasser
anything else on your mind?
strasser turns to look back at the park.  he no longer
has a clear shot at jill.  he realizes he's going to have
to move in close.
from his jacket he takes a .45 caliber semi-automatic
match master and a barrel extension which he screws on
with great concentration using his gloved hand.
strasser begins to work his way into the park.
