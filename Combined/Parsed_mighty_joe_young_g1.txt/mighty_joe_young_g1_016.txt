superimpose:  12 years later.
a quickly-moving dust cloud turns out to be --
humvee
racing at breakneck speed over the dirt highway.  driven
by gregg o'hara -- anyone would consider him young,
strong and handsome -- except that right now, it's all
hidden under the grime from a long flight and a week's
growth of beard.  hair long, unkempt; clothes wrinkled.
gregg passes four local men burning a clearing in the
woods for yet more farmland.
pushing its way up the mountain side.  the humvee is
packed with equipment that rattles as gregg hits every
bump in the road.
