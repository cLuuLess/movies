a warm golden light bathes the jungle.  shafts of
sunlight filter through the forest floor.  the sounds of
wild birds break the hushed quiet of the setting.  as we
move in we find a large female mountain gorilla lounging,
eating leaves in the dense undergrowth, her precocious
baby gorilla plays nearby.
through camera lens
a view of the mother gorilla, a few pictures snapped.
back to scene
the photographer is ruth young, naturalist, researcher,
sitting in the undergrowth with her camera, notebooks,
and sketch pad.  her precocious young daughter, jill,
plays nearby.
jill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown.  as the baby
sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides
his face behind it.  jill does the same.  she peeks out to
catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her
eye.  they both scamper to different trees.  each time
they move to a different tree, they go through this
peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from
their mothers.  the mother gorilla notices, lets out a
cry.  ruth looks around for jill and signals by a
distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant.
both children take a last look at each other and then
scurry to their waiting mothers.
ruth
jill.  what did i tell you?
jill
but joe started it!
ruth
it's not good for them to interact
with us.
(gathering her things)
besides, that wasn't joe.  it was
marley.

jill helps her mother heft the equipment as they start to
head back to camp.
jill
no it wasn't.  it was joe.
ruth
joe is just a baby, jill.  he was
too big to be joe.
as they walk, they can see the sunset over the mountain
trail.
jill
check.  check the pictures.
ruth looks down at her daughter, surprised by the
confidence in her voice.
