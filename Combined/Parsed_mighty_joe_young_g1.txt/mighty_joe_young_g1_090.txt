now someone steps out of the passenger side of the cab.

it's strasser.  avoiding the back of the trailer (where
he would encounter joe), strasser stays where he is and
calls out to jill in hushed tones.
strasser
jill, i got the plane.  it's
waiting at the airport.  we must
hurry.
strasser holds his hand up in salute to gregg and cecily --
that's about as close as he wants to get to them.  using
urgency as an excuse, he jumps back into the trailer
before anyone can engage him in further conversation.
it's time to say good-bye.  cecily looks into the back of
the trailer.
cecily
i'm going to miss your ugly face.
be good, joe.
harry (o.s.)
yeah.  don't start a fight with
anyone bigger than you.
harry steps out of the shadows.  everyone turns and looks
at him.  he feels their eyes on him and shuffles a
little.
harry
you'd better leave out of the
west gate.  the guard there got
called away.  urgent business.
jill puts her arms around harry.  he's antsy and
embarrassed.
jill
you're not such a big coward after
all.
harry
(as she keeps
 hugging)
okay, okay, let go.
harry disengages from jill and disappears back where he
came from.
now cecily turns to jill.  she hugs her with great emotion.
cecily
write me when joe gets settled.

jill
i promise.
cecily moves off, leaving gregg and jill alone to say
good-bye.  they look into each other's eyes, hating to
part, everything they have to say to each other still
unsaid.
jill
(yearning)
you coming to the airport, or...?
gregg
(strained)
i think i better stay here and keep
people away from that bunker.  give
you a head start before they
realize he's gone.
jill is crumbling.  for her, it's awful to leave him, but
he's not acting heart-broken at all.  confused, she tries
desperately to stay light.  she chatters like a nervous
schoolgirl.
jill
(stammering)
well -- if you're ever in botswana,
come by and take me out to a good
meal in a fine restaurant.  that
is, if you're not afraid to tell
joe that you'll get me home by...
she doesn't get the rest of her sentence out because gregg
is kissing her mouth.  it's the kiss he's been wanting to
give her since the day he first laid eyes on her.
he lets go of her again, leaving her breathlessly looking
after him.  he walks to the back of the trailer.
gregg and joe make serious eyes contact.
gregg
(pointedly, to joe)
take care of her for me, will ya?
gregg shuts the trailer door and walks off, not daring to
look back.  jill is about to call after him when strasser
steps back out of the passenger's side of the trailer.
he whispers urgently:
strasser
jill!  we must go!
jill runs to the passenger side of the trailer.
