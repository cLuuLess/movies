ext. freeway - night
112
joe steps into the first eight lanes of freeway traffic.
we hear some screeching and skidding as the first four
drivers of the first four cars in each northbound lane
spot joe and slam on the brakes.
miraculously, nobody crashes.  bumpers remain uncrushed.
almost ceremoniously, the oncoming traffic comes to a
respectful halt as joe hesitantly lumbers past.

it's almost like church.  the freeway becomes quiet.
nobody honks.  nobody screams.
overcome with awe, a woman steps out of her car and just
stands there in the middle of the freeway, watching joe
pass.  others follow suit.
joe climbs the center divider.  the same thing happens in
the southbound lane.
as joe disappears up the hill on the other side, the
stunned drivers simply stare in disbelief.  l.a. is in awe.
