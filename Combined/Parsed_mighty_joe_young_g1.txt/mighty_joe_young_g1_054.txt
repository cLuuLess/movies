ext. joe's habitat - another angle - that moment
51b
the camera finds gregg, leaning against the bar at the
edge of the moat.  his face is soft as he watches joe.
joe lists his mammoth head and looks up towards the right
corner of his habitat.  gregg follows joe's eyeline and
sees that joe is looking at a transformer.  the electric
buzz reaches gregg's ear... and he becomes aware of it in
a new way.  he hears its hum the way joe hears it --
strange, menacing.
gregg shakes his head to himself -- why didn't the
designers pay attention to this?  he looks back at joe,
almost apologetically, and is startled to find that:
joe is looking back at him.
it is the first time these two have had real eye contact,
and for gregg it is almost overwhelming.  man and beast
read each other's faces, and it is in this moment that
the giant ape becomes more than a phenomenon to gregg.
gregg finally feels some of what jill has been feeling.
he connects to joe.
and joe connects to gregg.  it's just a blink of the eye,
a turn of the head -- but it's there.  and they both feel
it.
