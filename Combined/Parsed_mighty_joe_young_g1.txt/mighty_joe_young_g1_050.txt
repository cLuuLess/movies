int. hallway of conservancy condo - day
50a
jill and gregg are at a door that gregg is unlocking.
jill paces angrily and storms through the door as gregg
opens it.  camera follows gregg in.  he's carrying her
bags.
jill
(imitating harry)
'i'm in charge of this facility.'
who is that guy?  i bet that man
hasn't spent one night outside in
his entire life.
gregg
probably not.
jill
you said i was going to be in
charge of joe.  i should be
sleeping down there, with him, not
in this... this...
(taking in the
 space)
cage.
gregg is grim and quiet.  he thinks what she's saying is
true.  he sets her bags down, detesting the antiseptic
space as much as she does.
feeling claustrophobic, jill dashes to the window and
tries to open it.  it's a double-paned window.  the top
doesn't open at all -- the bottom cranks open three
inches, barely letting in air.  jill pushes on the
window, horrified?
jill
what's wrong with this window?
(pushing on it)
that's all it opens?  that's all?

continued:

jill (cont'd)
(growing breathless)
this is wrong.  this is all
wrong...
(pleading)
please, fix it, or do something...
it only takes a second.  gregg grabs a pillow from the
couch and lays it against the top portion of the window.
he gives it one swift karate chop, breaking out the glass.
he methodically breaks out the remaining shards, dusts off
the pillow, and carefully replaces it on the couch.
jill just stares at him, open-mouthed.  gregg looks her
straight in the eye.
gregg
(quietly)
i'll do everything i can for you.
they hold each other's eyes.
jill
(small voice)
thank you.
gregg walks out.
