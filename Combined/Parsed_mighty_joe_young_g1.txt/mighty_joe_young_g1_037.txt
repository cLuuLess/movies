ext. village - morning
36
in the center of the village, two trucks of rough-looking
men are gassing up their vehicles.  a third truck arrives
from the other direction.
it's a poacher we recognize, one of pindi's men,
accompanied by a half dozen others, all armed with rifles.
angle on jill
she steps out in front of the poacher's truck.  the
driver slams on the brakes, stopping within an inch of
striking her.  alarmed, the poacher stands in his seat
and screams at jill.
poacher
stupid girl!  what do you think
you're doing?
jill calmly walks up to the poacher's side of the vehicle.
jill
i found this in the forest this
morning.  thought maybe you
dropped it and might want it back.
with that, jill brazenly steps forward and throws a net
over his head.  it's a poacher's net.
enraged, the poacher slowly pulls the net off his head.
the other poachers find the scene hilarious.  it
infuriates jill.
jill
poaching is illegal!  get off this
mountain!

the poacher and his driver exchange a significant look.
nodding to each other, they start to climb out of their
truck, eyes glaring at jill...
kweli (o.s.)
jill!  jill young!
everyone turns to see kweli walking quickly towards them.
kweli
(to jill)
come here immediately!  you are
needed at the school this moment!
kweli is trying to give her a way to save face.  jill
knows it, but she doesn't want to back down before the
poachers.
kweli snatches jill by the elbow and drags her away.  the
poachers hiss and cat call.  jill walks away slowly.  she
wants to make sure they know she's not running.
kweli hisses furiously into her ear:
kweli
we have to talk.  now.
