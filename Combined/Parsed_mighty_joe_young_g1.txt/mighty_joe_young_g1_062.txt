ext. joe's habitat - continuous action

gregg and cecily watch as jill plays hide and seek with
joe.
jill dashes away and runs over to gregg.  she is
absolutely glowing, bouncing around with happiness.  she
grabs both his arms, jumping up and down.
jill
he's playing!  did you see?
gregg
(laughing)
i saw.
jill
he likes it here!  isn't it great?
gregg
it's great.
jill surprises gregg by giving him a hug.  gregg looks over
her shoulder and sees that joe is giving him the evil eye.
he's jealous.  gregg stares back, equally challenging.
jill, unaware of the competition, lets go of gregg and
happily runs back to joe.  gregg and joe continue to hold
each other's eyes.  cecily sighs and shakes her head.
cecily
sorry, babe, but in a pissing
match the monkey kicks your ass.

gregg
what are you talking about?
cecily
oh please.  i was wondering why
you hadn't taken off yet.
normally, you're out the door soon
as the animal's in his habitat.
gregg
you've got an active imagination,
cecily.
cecily
i don't think so.  i think mr.
world traveller has goo-goo eyes
for the gorilla girl.
gregg scoffs.  but from the look on his face, it's clear
she's hit a nerve.
