int. ruth's hut - day
36a
this is jill's mother's hut.  it is full of significant
mementos -- her mother's old bulletin board, photographs,
research, etc.  it feels homey.
kweli, distraught with worries over jill, rips a photo of
her mother from the wall and shoves it in front of her face.
kweli
your mother slept in this bed.
she worked at this desk.  she died
in this jungle.  do you plan to do
everything just like her?
jill
my mother would have been proud of
what i did today.
kweli
(angry)
proud?  of that foolishness out
there?  of you risking your life?

jill
she risked hers -- why shouldn't i
risk mine?  i'm just doing what i
promised, and i promised to protect
joe.  and i'm going to do
everything i can to stop the
poachers...
kweli
you can't stop them.
(more gently)
even she couldn't stop them.
jill holds the photo of her mother tightly in her hands.
kweli
jill, the other gorillas have
moved south, to safer lands...
but joe has stayed behind.
jill
they don't want him.  they won't
let him come.
kweli
maybe... or maybe you won't let
him go.
jill
(sharply)
he needs me.
it's only half the truth, and they both know the other
half -- that jill needs joe, too.  kweli sighs.  he puts
his hand protectively on jill's shoulder.
kweli
the danger here is building for
both of you.  i feel it -- and so
do you.
jill looks away.  she knows he's right.
kweli
i know what the american is
offering, jill.
jill looks into kweli's eyes.  he must be very worried,
to be checking around like this.
kweli
think about what he has to say.
that's all i ask.
kweli leaves jill to mull it over.
41a.
