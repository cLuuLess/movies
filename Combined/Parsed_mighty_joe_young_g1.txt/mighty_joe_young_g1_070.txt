ext. outside joe's habitat - day
68b
garth walks quickly -- but not fast enough to draw
attention.  he moves along the handrail at the edge of
the moat.  takes off his sunglasses and looks for joe.
garth's pov - joe
is moving slowly among saplings.
close on garth's hand
as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out one of the
poaching dog collars.  garth looks around -- then gives
the metal clappers one loud shake -- quickly drops them
back into his pocket.
joe reacts immediately to the jangling sound.  imprinted
deep in his memory.  he rises up quickly and growls
furiously -- pounding his chest -- looking around for the
danger.  it's instinctive and frightening.  joe sees garth
and charges him.  joe's anger takes him into the
electrified wire around the habitat.  joe roars at the
shock and recoils.
