int. jill's apartment - day
58b
mementos, photos, and fabrics from home are strewn
around, already adding jill's warmth and personality to
the place.
jill is standing at the window hanging an african piece
of fabric as a makeshift curtain when a piercing alarm
rings out over the compound.  worried by the urgent sound
of the alarm, jill steps down and hurries out the door.
