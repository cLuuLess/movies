int. hut - night

ruth young's hut.  on one side is a makeshift field
laboratory, highlighted by a wall collage of photos --
family shots mixed right in with gorilla shots.
ruth
sits on the edge of a cot, tucking jill into bed.  she
leans down, kisses jill gently on her forehead.
ruth
jill, what made you think the
gorilla we saw today was joe?
jill
i was right, wasn't i?

ruth
my notes say that joe is only six
months old.  either i got
confused, or he's a very unusual
gorilla.
jill
(sing-song)
i told you so.
ruth
yes, you did.  and mommy's going
to write it down in her book.
she holds up a dog-eared composition book, ruth's detailed
log of her observations.
ruth
right here.  '... and my trusted
colleague, dr. jill young, showed
me the error of my ways.'
jill smiles.
ruth
now go to sleep.
ruth begins singing a lullaby.
ruth
(singing)
'sleep till the night ends, the
night wind will sing for you.
your song and my song.  it goes on
forever.'
as she sings, a man appears in the doorway.  this is
kweli, the camp manager.  he seems nervous and impatient,
but doesn't want to disturb ruth.  jill sees him.
jill
goodnight, kweli.
ruth turns.
ruth
kweli?  what is it?
kweli
you should come.  quickly.
as soon as she hears the words, ruth is up.  as she leaves
the hut, she grabs her walking stick.

jill
mommy, can i...
ruth
stay here, jill.
ruth exits, kweli behind her.  jill follows, despite her
mother's orders... but kweli feels her behind him.  he
turns around and crouches down, looking jill seriously in
the face:
kweli
(fatherly)
stay here, child.
