ext. palisades ocean park - various shots - night

quintessentially american images of beach-side amusement
park.  a carnival-like atmosphere.
angle - archway entrance
some couples stop to take their photos, kissing under
the iconic neon arch that welcomes people to the park.
young couple
stops to share the view -- and a kiss.  until a loud
growl makes them jump back.
joe has appeared under the arch.  the young girl
screams -- her boyfriend pulls her back.
joe's pov
it's like a slow-motion panic.  the noise and tumult of
the crowded park keeps people from hearing the screams
right away.
one toddler smiles and waves at joe until his mother
snatches him and runs for dear life.

at ferris wheel
a crowd of kids waits in line.  one of them, a particularly
appealing little boy named jason, is having a conversation
with his mother.  she has the aura of a single mom about her,
and she clearly adores her sweet-faced kid.
jason
mom, i don't think i can let
you go on the ferris wheel.
jason's mother
why not?
jason
because the last time after you
ate two hot dogs, you threw up,
remember?
jason's mother
what if i promised to throw up
over the side?
they both giggle at her joke.
jason
mom, i think i should do this
ride by myself.
jason's mother
(reluctant)
okay... i'll watch you.
tilt up to the wheel turning majestically -- filled with
kids.  some wave from the chairs as they crest -- it
feels like they're flying over the ocean below.
we notice two girls (jenny, seven, and emma, nine) as
they come over the top.  on the way down, they can see
the crowd parting below as joe enters frame.
at the base of the great wheel -- parents are finally
hearing the commotion.
by light
joe arrives at his destination -- the bright light that
drew him here.  he's confused by the fact that jill's
nowhere to be found.  desperately, he scans the park...
people scream and panic around joe.  the noise drives
him deeper into the park, searching for jill.

at arcade - big safari booth
three college guys shoot replica air guns at cardboard
lions and elephants, setting off fake explosions in a
"big safari" booth.
joe
feels threatened and recoils.  then he continues past
them.  the rush of people away from him gets more
frenzied.
