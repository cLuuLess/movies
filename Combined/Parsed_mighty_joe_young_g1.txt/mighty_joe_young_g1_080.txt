ext. joe's habitat - continuous action
77
joe is feeding on bamboo in the center of his habitat
when something abruptly catches his ear.  a slight
jangling sound, the timpani of wind chimes, floating
through the air.  it grows louder.
joe stands up.  the hair on his neck bristles.  he moves
towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat.
joe's pov
garth stands at the railing surrounding the moat,
rattling the dog collars.  it's a sound that haunts him,
from the darkest depths of his memory.  he starts to growl
and then he sees something that really drives him nuts.
strasser steps into the light, joining garth by the
water's edge.  he rattles the dog collar, and now...
zoom in on joe
his eyes, locking with strasser's.  his pupils narrow,
his nostrils flare, and joe freaks out!
he starts tearing up the ground, beating his chest, then
he roars and charges straight for them, stopping at the
water's edge.

on strasser
locking eyes with joe.  this is the first time he has seen
joe since the animal bit his hand off twelve years ago.  a
smile creeps across his face.
strasser
(to himself)
so you haven't forgotten me.  good.
(holding up his
 dead hand)
have you forgotten this?
garth is still rattling the dog collar, enjoying joe's
display of rage.
garth
what do you think the big guy is
worth?  a couple million?
strasser
i will get that for the paws alone.
after we sell him off piece by
piece, who knows how much we'll
make?
garth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making joe
rush at them again.
garth
got you going now!  that should
rattle the jewelry off the ladies.
strasser
(indicating dog
 collar)
hang it there -- where he can see
it.
(warning)
and come back for it -- after.
garth hangs the dog collar on the fence.  joe can hear it
clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state.
strasser
come, we've done our job here.
as strasser and garth leave, joe looks after them, beside
himself with fury.  outraged, he turns this way and that
way, finally focusing on a tall tree in his habitat.
