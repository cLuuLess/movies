     int. squad room

     tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with 
     his back to the rest of the room.  the voucher for st. 
     katherine's is in his hand as eddie moves quickly toward 
     him.

                               tate
               st. katherine's convent on east barton. 
               it's gotta be the place.

     tate hangs up the phone and boom!  eddie hits him from 
     behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  other 
     detectives look up from their desks with confusion and 
     alarm.  eddie pins tate to the wall and snatches the 
     voucher from his hand.

                               eddie
               you're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!

     clarkson and another detective restrain eddie before he 
     can hit tate.

                               eddie
               get him out of here!  downstairs, in the 
               cell!  i want his ass locked up now!

     nobody dares even question eddie at this moment, and two 
     detectives drag tate away.  eddie grabs tate's phone and 
     dials long distance.

                               eddie
               clarkson, get on the other line.  call 
               frisco central.  tell 'em to get two 
               squad cars outside st. katherine's 
               convent, and stop anybody with an out-of-
               state license plate from getting near the 
               place.

     clarkson dials quickly.  eddie listens to tate's telephone 
     as it rings and rings and rings.
