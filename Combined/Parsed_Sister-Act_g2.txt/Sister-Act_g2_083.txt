     int. vince larocca's living room - night

     connie larocca, vince's wife, watches the tv news story 
     and calls to vince in the kitchen.

                               connie
               vinnie, get in here.  you gotta see 
               this!

     carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, vince 
     appears from the kitchen and glances at the tv screen to 
     see a shot of the convent.  he looks at connie and makes a 
     sour face.

     page 77.

                               vince
               what?  nuns?  you got me in here to see 
               nuns?  isn't there a ball game on or 
               something?

     vince turns away from the tv just as a closeup of christy 
     appears on the screen.

                               connie
               look -- she's adorable!

     vince leaves the room, and we see christy again as she 
     leads the choir.
