     int. christy's cell

     the door swings open, and mother superior and christy 
     enter.  the room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  there 
     is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered 
     mattress.  there is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.

                               christy
                             (looking around)
               you were right the first time.  is this 
               like, solitary?  the cooler?  where's the 
               furniture?

                               mother superior
               our lives are simple.  we have little 
               need for material possessions.

                               christy
               right, sure thing.  but what about, 
               like, appliances?  like a little color 
               portable?  boom box?

                               mother superior
               useless distractions.

                               christy
                             (sinking to the bed)
               it's like the stone age.  the room time 
               forgot.  what about a phone?

                               mother superior
               and whom would you call?

                               christy
               oh, i don't know... satan?

                               mother superior
                             (not amused) 
               your cell is more than adequate.

                               christy
               right.  so what do we do now?  ping-
               pong?  row over to the monastery?

                               mother superior
               it is nine p.m.  pleasant dreams.

                               christy
               wait.  no.  you're kidding.  lights out? 
               at nine?  my day's just starting.

                               mother superior
                i'm sure.  if i were you, i would use 
               this time, to think about my life.  and 
               its direction.  or lack thereof.

                               christy
                             (indignant)
               what's wrong with my life?

                               mother superior
               from all i've heard, just about 
               everything.  your singing career seems 
               all but nonexistent, and your married 
               lover wants you dead.

                               mother superior (cont'd)
               if you're fooling anyone, it's only 
               yourself.  god has brought you here. take 
               the hint.

     mother superior leaves.

     after the door shuts, christy stands and looks out the one 
     small window in her cell.  she leans her head against the 
     wall.  she is trying not to think about what mother 
     superior has said.  still, the mess her life has become 
     overwhelms her.  she fights back tears.
