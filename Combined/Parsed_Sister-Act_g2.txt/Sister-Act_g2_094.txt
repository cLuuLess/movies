     int. las vegas police department - day

     tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the 
     sports section.  henry parker, the accountant for the 
     police department, looks stressful as he enters the room 
     and heads for eddie's glassed-in office.  tate glances up 
     as parker passes his desk.

                               tate
               you're too late.  mulcahy just left.

                               parker
               i need his signature on some things. 
               they can't be processed without it.

                               tate
               leave 'em.  he'll sign 'em later.

     parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from 
     procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the 
     file folder on tate's desk and walks away.

     tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  bored, 
     looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and 
     glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for 
     equipment, supplies, etc.  tate is about to close the 
     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.

                               tate
               what the hell is this...?

     he examines a money voucher for a generous donation to st. 
     katherine's convent in san francisco.  it only takes a 
     moment to put two and two together, and tate scrambles for 
     his phone and dials a number.
