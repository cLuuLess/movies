     int. st. anne's academy - akron, ohio - classroom
     we are in a parochial school classroom, in the late 
     sixties.  the children all wear uniforms and sit at little 
     desks.  sister immaculata stands at the front of the room; 
     she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  the children are 
     all terrified of her.

                               sister immaculata
               who can name all the apostles?  yes?

     angle on christine carter

     a thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  she raises 
     her hand.

                               sister immaculata
               christine?

                               christine
               sister, may i be excused?

                               sister immaculata
               christine...

                               christine
               it's an emergency.  real bad.

     sister immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  christine 
     stands and heads for the door.
