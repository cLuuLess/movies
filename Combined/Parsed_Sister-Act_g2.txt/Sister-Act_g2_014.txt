     int. executive corridor

     beyond the cubicles, christy strides down a lush corridor 
     to an executive suite.  she tries the knob, but finds the 
     door locked.  pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the 
     door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a 
     reception area and doors to several inner offices.  she 
     tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.

                               christy
               won't need that anymore.  ta-ta.

     crossing to vince's office, christy squares her shoulders 
     and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the 
     doorknob.  she pauses for a second, and then doubles her 
     resolve.
