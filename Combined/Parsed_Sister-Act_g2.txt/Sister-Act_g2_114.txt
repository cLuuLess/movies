     int. chapel

     there is a sense of chaos in the chapel as technicians set 
     up television equipment, and mother superior leads the 
     choir as it rehearses.  near the back of the chapel, bishop 
     o'hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. a 
     cardinal walks up to bishop o'hara.

                               cardinal
               is this the choir you've been speaking 
               so highly of, bishop?

                               o'hara
               they're just a bit nervous.  they'll be 
               fine.

     the choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn. 
     mary patrick is close to tears.

                               mary patrick
               we sound terrible   we need mary 
               clarence.

                               mary lazarus
               we're losing it.

                               mary robert
               i don't understand.  where is she?

                               mother superior
               her whereabouts are unknown, and we must 
               proceed without her.  pull yourselves 
               together.

     clapping his hands briskly, the floor director suddenly 
     steps forward from behind the tv cameras and hustles the 
     choir away from the altar.

                               floor director
               okay, sisters, we have to move on now. 
               that was great, just great.  charlie, 
               throw a spot on the pulpit.  let's get a 
               balance.

     dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward 
     the back of the church.
