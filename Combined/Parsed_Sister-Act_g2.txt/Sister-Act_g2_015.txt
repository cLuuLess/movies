     int. vince's office

                               vince
               do it.
                             (to joey)

     angle on the door to the office, which opens.  christy 
     appears, with the mink coat in her arms.

                               christy
               stuff this up your...

     a gunshot is heard, 0.s.  christy's eyes widen, and her 
     jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed.

     angle on the office.  ernie is slumped in the chair, dead. 
     joey stands over him, holding the revolver.  joey, willy 
     and vince stare at christy.

                               vince
               babe.
                             (icy calm)

     christy tries to speak; she can't.

                               vince
               christy.  is there a problem?  with the 
               coat?

     christy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  she 
     quickly sizes up the situation.  she tries to appear 
     matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.

                               christy
               no... it's fine. 

                               vince
               yes?

                               christy
               thanks.  a lot.

                               vince
               is that why you came up here, christy? 
               to thank me?

                               christy
               sure.

                               vince
               and to say you're sorry.  about this 
               afternoon.  and the things you said. 
               forgotten.  completely.  do you 
               understand?  forgotten.

                               christy
                             (catching the subtext)
               right.  yeah.  forgotten.

     page 13.

     vince crosses the room, to christy.  he takes her hands in 
     his, and kisses them.

                               vince
               that's my girl.  my girl in mink.  will 
               you be home?  soon?

     christy kisses vince, quickly.

                               christy
               right.  i'll be... at the apartment.  
               call me.  thanks.  again.

     christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the 
     door.  she fumbles a bit.  she finds the door.

                               christy
               mink.  wow.

     christy walks backwards, out the door.  she turns; she is 
     gone.

                               joey
               vince -- is she... okay?

                               vince
               maybe.
                             (considering this)

                               willy
               i mean, won't she talk? she seemed kind 
               of upset.

                               vince
               she did.
                             (making a decision)
               bring her back.  now.  for a talk.

                               joey 
               and if she runs? 

                               vince
                             (icy)
               take care of it.

     with guns drawn, willy and joey run after christy.
