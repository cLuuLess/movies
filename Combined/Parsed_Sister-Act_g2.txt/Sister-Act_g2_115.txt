     ext. los angeles street

     the motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every 
     traffic law on the books.  christy's robe flaps behind her 
     in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides.  as 
     passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and 
     blesses them.
