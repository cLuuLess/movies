     ext. street - night

     christy and mary robert are walking back to the convent. 
     they are both in very good spirits.

                               mary robert
               those people are wonderful!  why don't 
               we ever see them in church?

                               christy
               good point.  especially that dude you 
               were with.  i'd like to see him down 
               front.

                               mary robert
                             (giggling)
               mary clarence!  you're so... different 
               from the other sisters.  sometimes, 
               well... sometimes you sound more like a 
               layperson.

                               christy
               honey.

     as the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car 
     that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with 
     its headlights out.

                               mary robert
               i can't wait to tell reverend mother 
               about all my experiences.  i've learned 
               so much.

                               christy
               well, you know, you don't have to tell 
               her everything.  i mean, nothing really 
               happened.  we just... took a walk.

     the car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns 
     turn, startled.  the car hurtles toward them.  they scream, 
     and christy grabs mary robert and throws her out of the 
     car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.

     struggling to her feet, christy sees the car go into 
     reverse, and then pull forward again.  she sees a glint of 
     light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (mike the 
     bartender) leans out the window.

                               christy
                             (to mary robert)
               run!

     christy shoves mary robert towards an alley.  as she does 
     so, the gun goes off with a red flash.  the shot misses the 
     two women and shatters a plate glass window of the store 
     behind them.
