     the choir really lets loose flow.

                               christy and choir
               let thy thoughts be strengthened
               let thy prayers be heard
               let our lord rejoice in your praise
               let his goodness lift you to a higher 
               place
               and let love and peace fill your days

     lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the 
     chapel.  bishop o'hara sees them, and beckons them to come 
     in.

     sister alma, inspired by christy and the choir, burns up 
     the organ with a solo.  more people from the street begin 
     to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music.

     at the end of the solo, christy makes a gesture to the 
     choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  the chapel 
     is full of energy, music and life.

     mary robert sings, really letting the power of her voice 
     ring out.  she is astonishingly good.

               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed
               by a voice you hear from on high
               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed
               let thy soul take wing and fly!

     the new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to 
     the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in.  mother 
     superior is aghast.

     the choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping 
     their eyes on christy.

                               choir
               let thy spirit

                               christy
               you know what we're saying!

                               choir
               let thy spirit

                               christy
               i think they hear you!

                               mary lazarus
               let thy spirit

                               christy and choir
               let thy spirit take wing and flyi

     after the final note, everyone in the chapel is 
     exhilarated -- everyone except mother superior.  christy 
     looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen 
     or more, including lawanda and her friends.  christy looks 
     happier than she has in years.
