     int. chapel

     christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that 
     is filled with money.

                               christy
               jackpot!  two buckets

                               mary patrick
               this is so exhilarating!  all week long, 
               i can't wait till sunday, when we sing.

                               mary robert
               i'd rather sing than do anything!

                               mary patrick
               it's better than ice cream.

                               mary robert
               it's better than springtime.

                               christy
               it's better than sex!

     everyone looks at christy with astonishment.

                               christy
                             (catching herself)
               i imagine.

     everyone's attention suddenly turns to bishop o'hara as he 
     approaches.

                               o'hara
               better and better, sisters, you are 
               truly an inspiration.  and i bear 
               gladsome tidings.

     the choir gathers around o'hara with curiosity.

                               o'hara
               i've kept the cardinal informed of your 
               progress in the neighborhood.  he has 
               been most impressed.  and he has invited 
               you to attend a special evening mass at 
               st. matthew's cathedral on sunday night1 
               to sing for the council of cardinals.

     the choir reacts with an excited buzz:  "the council of 
     cardinals!", "what shall we sing?", etc.

     mother superior appears, from the center aisle.

                               mother superior
               that is indeed glorious news, bishop. we 
               will be honored to appear.

                               mother superior (cont'd)
               and on such an occasion, i feel a 
               completely traditional program will be 
               best.

                               christy
               what do you mean?

                               mother superior
               the council of cardinals is perhaps the 
               most esteemed body in the entire catholic 
               church.  they command the utmost respect.  
               your more... secular entertainment would 
               be wholly out of place.

                               mary patrick
               but, reverend mother -- everyone loves 
               our new style.

                               mary robert
               it's brought people back to the church.

                               christy
               isn't that why we were asked to sing for 
               those cardinals?

                               mother superior
               i believe this can be settled by a 
               simple vote.

                               christy
               a vote?

                               mother superior
               of course.  mary clarence, a convent is 
               not a totalitarian state.  most major 
               decisions are made by the membership as a 
               whole.  a membership that, i am certain, 
               will vote in a rational and pious manner.  
               all those in favor of allowing mary 
               clarence to select a program?

     all the nuns look at one another.  then, slowly, one by 
     one, they all raise their hands.

     mother superior is pure steel at this moment; her 
     expression betrays no emotion.  christy, on the other hand, 
     is quite confused.

                               christy
               but... wait a minute...

                               mother superior
               the majority has spoken.

     page 84.

                               bishop o'hara
               reverend mother, as always, you are a 
               true leader.  gracious and understanding.

                               mary robert
               it will be wonderful, reverend mother. 
               you'll see.

                               mary lazarus
                             (gesturing to christy)
               she's a pro.

                               christy
               what?

                               mother superior
               i am certain the presentation will be a 
               great success.  congratulations, mary 
               clarence.  and congratulations to you 
               all.

     the nuns cheer, and cluster around christy, chattering 
     about the upcoming concert, as mother superior strides off.
