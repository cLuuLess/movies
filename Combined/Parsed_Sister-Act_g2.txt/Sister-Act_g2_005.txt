     int. christy's apartment - angle on a large, tattered 
     poster-night (today)

     taped over a crack on a wall.  the poster shows a 
     glittering christy van cartier:  singing star of a fifth-
     rate vegas lounge.  christy wears tight spangles and a 
     major wig on the poster.  she has clearly lived up, or 
     down, to all of sister immaculata's expectations.

     the camera pans through the dark bedroom in which the 
     poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, 
     casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  a dressing 
     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail 
     polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry 
     are scattered everywhere.

     we hear the movement of bed springs as someone sits up in 
     the dark.

                               christy's voice
               come on, vince -- hold me a minute.

                               vince's voice
               i'd love to. babe -- but i've got to go.  
               it was great.  like usual.

                               christy's voice
               it was twenty minutes.  like usual.

                               vince's voice
               the best.

     vince larocca stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing 
     and checking his hair.  vince is a powerful, charismatic 
     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal 
     magnetism and threat.  vince's hold over christy is 
     obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous 
     one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.

                               vince
                             (half to christy, half 
                             to the mirror)
               you are something else.

     christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.

                               christy
               come on -- stay.  just a little.  we can 
               talk, i'll get a pizza.  pizza in bed, 
               we'll have fun.  and you still haven't 
               told me what happened.  what did she say?

                               vince
               what did who say?

                               christy
               who?  the other woman.  your wife.

     vince turns to face christy, turning on the charm.

                               vince
               you are so damn sexy.

                               christy
               vince...

                               vince
               how did i get so lucky?  what is it now, 
               five years we've been together?  who do i 
               thank?

                               christy
                             (not buying it)
               today was the deadline, vince.

     vince sits on the bed.  he takes christy's hand, and 
     kisses it.

                               vince
               i want us to be together.  like people.  
               honest, decent people.  in the eyes of 
               god.  babe, today... i went to 
               confession.

                               christy
               you did what?

                               vince
               for the first time in i don't know how 
               long.  i wanted everything done right. 
               open and above board.  i told father 
               antonelli i was in love.  i told him it 
               was a special love, for all the ages.

                               christy
                             (starting to fall for 
                             it)
               you said that?  and what did he say?  
               did he say you could leave her?  did he 
               say we'd be happy?

                               vince
                             (looking deep into her 
                             eyes)
               he said that if i got a divorce i'd burn 
               in hell.  for all eternity.

     vince kisses christy's hands again and drops turns away 
     and starts putting on his shoes.

                               christy
               what?
                             (outraged)

                               vince
               you want me to go against a priest?  get 
               excommunicated?  you think i'm nuts?

                               christy
               you bastard!

                               vince
                             (trying to calm her)
               we can still see each other.  just like 
               always.  it's a different kind of sin. 
               smaller.

                               christy
               you pig!

     vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.

                               vince
               babe, it's not me!  i love you!  it's 
               god!

                               christy
               you lying sleazeball!  the best years of 
               my life!  what am i, garbage?  am i lint?

     vince ducks as christy throws an ashtray at him, and it 
     smashes against the wall.

                               vince
               you're upset.  i understand.  i should 
               go.  i hate to.

     page 5.

     a clock-radio hits the wall beside vince's head.

                               christy
               get out of here!  and never come back!

     a lamp hits the wall, as vince dodges it.  he makes a 
     phone gesture with his hand.

                               vince
               i'll call.

     vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to christy. 
     he leaves.

     christy is left standing on the bed, holding a 
     particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl.  
     with vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed 
     animal. she is caught between tears and rage.
