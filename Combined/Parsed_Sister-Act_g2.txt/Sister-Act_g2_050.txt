     int. convent schoolroom - an hour later

     a plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style 
     desks.  a group of about eight local teenage girls has 
     gathered.  the girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and 
     clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad 
     girls.  sister mary patrick is leading the class, in her 
     usual perky manner.

                               mary patrick
               good afternoon, young ladies.  and 
               welcome to our christian youth group.

     the girls make grunting noises.

                               mary patrick
               hi.  i hope we'll have some fun, and 
               maybe learn a little something, too. now, 
               today's topic is something very up-to-
               date -- "teenage promiscuity."  my. now, 
               can anyone tell me -- just what is 
               promiscuity?

     angle on the girls, exchanging glances and rolling their 
     eyes.

                               mary patrick
               anyone?  yes?

     mary patrick points to a girl in bicycle pants. a bustier 
     and a leather baseball cap.  her name is lawanda.

                               lawanda
               uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  a 
               whole lot.  till your head falls off.

                               mary patrick
                             (blushing)
               well, yes.  that is one way to put it.

     mother superior enters the classroom accompanied by 
     christy

                               mother superior
               sister mary patrick?

                               mary patrick
               yes?

                               mother superior
               i need to see you, at once.  girls, 
               please excuse sister mary patrick for a 
               few moments.  mary clarence?

                               christy
               yeah?

                               mother superior
               girls, this is sister mary clarence. 
               she'll be minding you until sister mary 
               patrick's return.  mary clarence, please 
               assign a biblical passage.  do not 
               attempt discussion.  am i understood?

                               christy
               i got it.

                               mother superior
                             (to mary patrick)
               come, sister.

     mother superior and mary patrick leave the classroom. 
     christy now stands at the front of the room.  she is 
     visibly uncomfortable.

                               christy
               so, hi there.  i'm... sister mary 
               clarence.  and you're... young 
               christians.  i guess i should assign you 
               this passage.  what's good?  what were 
               you talking about?

                               lawanda
               we were talking about the wild thing. 
               teen promiscuity.

                               christy
                             (after a beat)
               really.

                               charlene
               yeah.  sister mary pat was discussing 
               it.  you know she thinks it's a sin.

                               christy
                             (trying to behave)
               well... yes.  yes it is.

                               lawanda
                             (goading christy)
               how come?  sister?

                               christy
                             (still trying to 
                             behave)
               well... because it's in the bible. "thou 
               shalt not..."  thou shalt not.

     the girls all laugh and make jeering noises.

                               christy
               excuse me -- just what are you all doing 
               here?  at sunday school?

                               lawanda
               'cause we love it so damn much.  and 
               cause we gotta come here.  probation.

                               christy
               probation?

                               charlene
               yeah.  we all got caught.  shoplifting. 
               cuttin' school.  cuttin' up some bitch 
               with a blade.  so we gotta come here.  so 
               we'll be good, in the future.  so we'll 
               learn valuable lessons.  and i learned 
               mine.  i will be incredibly good, i will 
               never rip out nobody's nose-ring by 
               accident ever again.  can i go now?

                               christy
                             (getting fed up)
               yeah, you learned a whole lot, i can 
               tell.

                               lawanda
               well, what would you know about it, 
               anyway?  what do any of you nunheads know 
               about anything?  about doin' the nasty, 
               or gettin' high?

                               conchita
               leave her alone, lawanda, she's just 
               some ol' nun!  don't pick on no nun, it's 
               bad luck!

     page 40.

                               christy
                             (fed up)
               shut up!

     all the girls look up, stunned by christy's language.

                               christy
               okay, so maybe i'm a nun -- so, you want 
               to ask me something?  you want to listen, 
               for once in your little lives? you want 
               to pay some attention?

                               charlene
               what about crack?  you a user?

                               christy
               i said i was a nun, not an asshole.

     all the girls jeer at charlene.

                               keshia
               got you, charlene!

                               conchita
               dunked by the nun!

                               lawanda
                             (more sincerely)
               well, what about the sex stuff?  what if 
               some dude is after you, and he's always 
               saying stuff, commin' on sweet and 
               mellow.  like, oh, baby, you know you'll 
               love it.  oh, baby, if you loved me, 
               you'd stay.

                               christy
               and you listen to that?

                               lawanda
               no, but... i don't know... sometimes.

                               christy
               hey, i know, it's hard.  but do what i 
               do.

                               lawanda
                             (puzzled)
               what you do?

                               christy
               just tell him, i do love you, but i 
               can't -- i'm a nun.

     the girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like 
     christy.

     page 41.

                               charlene
               but, like what if you are doin' it? what 
               about protection?  who's responsible?

                               conchita
               what about them things, you know, for 
               the guy?  aren't they like, a mess to put 
               on?  don't they kinda mess up the mood?

                               christy
               deal with it, sweet thing.  it's 
               important, nowadays.  you just practice 
               at home, with a balloon and a banana.

                               mother superior (0.s.)
               mary clarence!

     mother superior has returned, with mary patrick.  everyone 
     has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has 
     noticed their entrance.

                               christy
                             (thinking on her feet)
               because a banana is part of a balanced 
               breakfast.  and don't forget fiber.
