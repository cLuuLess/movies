     ext. convent - day

     the sunday morning bell is chiming as crowds of people 
     stream into the convent.  the entire neighborhood looks 
     cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step. 
     three local tv stations have remote news crews on the scene 
     doing follow-ups on the story.
