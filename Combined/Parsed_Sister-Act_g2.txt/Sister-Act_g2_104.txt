     int. rehearsal room

     looking out the window, mary robert sees the bus.

                               mary robert
               it's here!  let's go!

     everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then 
     the group leaves the room to head for the bus.  mary robert 
     and mary patrick are the last to leave, except for christy.

                               mary patrick
               hurry, sister!

                               christy
               get moving.  i'm right behind you.

     christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves 
     the room.  she is puzzled to suddenly see eddie running 
     toward her from a side staircase.

                               christy
               eddie...?

     eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side 
     staircase.

                               eddie
               vince knows you're here.

                               christy
                             (shocked and scared)
               how?

                               eddie
               long story.  his goons will be here any 
               minute.  we've got to get you out of here 
               '- now!

     christy and eddie hurry down the steps to the side 
     entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes.  eddie 
     opens the door and starts outside, but christy stops in her 
     tracks.

                               christy
               i can't go with you.

                               eddie
               what?

                               christy
               i've got a show -- at st. matthew's 
               cathedral.  we're singing for the 
               cardinals.

                               eddie
               you're gonna be singing for st. peter if 
               you don't get your ass out of here!

     eddie jerks her hand, and christy follows him reluctantly 
     to the car.
