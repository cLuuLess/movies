     ext. las vegas - night

     angle on various neon vegas landmarks -- the golden 
     nugget, caesar's palace, bally's, etc.  scrunched in 
     between two larger hotels and casinos is the moonlight 
     hotel and casino.  the moonlight isn't all that small, it's 
     just seen better days.
