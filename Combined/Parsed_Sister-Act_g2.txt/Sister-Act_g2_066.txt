     int. mother superior's office

     mother superior is working on some papers at her desk as 
     christy enters.  christy is trying to figure out a 
     strategy.

                               christy
               so... hi there.

                               mother superior
                             (not amused and not 
                             looking up)
               i don't believe we have anything to say 
               to each other.

                               christy
               look... i know i shouldn't have, i'm 
               incredibly sorry about mary robert, i 
               wasn't thinking, i didn't know that would 
               happen!

     page 58.

     mother superior glances up from her work.  she is 
     justifiably outraged.

                               mother superior
               mary robert's life was in danger! your 
               behavior was inexcusable!

                               christy
               i know!  i'm sorry   i didn't mean for 
               it to happen!  and i was the one they 
               were shooting at!

                               mother superior
               mary clarence, i have given you every 
               opportunity.  to change.  to make a 
               decent life for yourself.

                               christy
               a decent life?  excuse me?  as what?  a 
               janitor?

                               mother superior
               clearly, you have learned nothing. and 
               you present an ongoing threat, both to 
               this convent and to yourself.

                               christy
               but you can't kick me out!  guys want to 
               kill me!  you're a nun!  a big nun! 
               aren't you supposed to have compassion? 
               for the wayward sheep?  i mean, i'm a 
               major sinner!  all-time great!  hall of 
               fame!  aren't i, like, your dream come 
               true?  your olympic event?

     mother superior stares at christy.

                               mother superior
               mary clarence, perhaps you are correct.

                               christy
                             (surprised)
               i am?

                               mother superior
               you may stay.  but i shall restrict your 
               activities to but a single task.

                               christy
                             (with great dread)
               what?

                               mother superior
               you have, i believe, some minimal 
               background in music.  therefore, you are 
               to join our choir.

                               mother superior (cont'd)
               you will sing, and you will sleep,' that 
               is your schedule until you depart.  as 
               almost no one attends mass, you will be 
               unable to cause further damage.

                               christy
               no.  no.

                               mother superior
                             (smiling)
               you're my olympic event.

                               christy
               not the choir, please, anything but 
               that.  the choir -- i mean, have you 
               heard them?  i'll do anything, scrub 
               floors, toilets, you name it, but not 
               that i

                               mother superior
                             (in triumph)
               the choir, mary clarence.  go for the 
               gold.
