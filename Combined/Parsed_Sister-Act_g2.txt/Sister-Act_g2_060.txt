     int. social club

     christy enters the club and grins.  she takes a drag on 
     the cigarette.  mary robert grabs the beer from christy's 
     hand, and takes a swig.

                               christy
                             (shocked)
               bobs

                               mary robert
               experience!  right?

                               christy
               right.

     the club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, 
     couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor 
     is packed.  the atmosphere is a combination of hazy 
     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the 
     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all 
     ages and races.  the music percolates, and christy starts 
     to move to it.  she and mary robert find a table in the 
     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.

                               christy
               a couple of bowls of chili.
                             (holding up the beer)
               and another round of these.

     the waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club 
     has never hosted nuns before.

                               mary robert
                             (to the waitress, 
                             confidentially)
               i have to do this.  so i can become a 
               nun.

                               christy
                             (to the waitress)
               initiation.  you understand.  later on, 
               we make her wear her underwear on her 
               head.

                               mary robert
               really?

                               christy
                             (to the waitress)
               and she wants to be a nun.

     the waitress leaves, shaking her head.  christy and mary 
     robert watch the action at the club.

     across the room, mike the bartender stares at the nuns, 
     especially christy; he tries to place her.

                               mary robert
               who are all these people?

                               christy
               this is your neighborhood.  your turf. 
               you should get to know 'em.

     from across the room, mike the bartender continues to 
     study christy's face.  he takes out a copy of vince's fax 
     photo and stares at it.  he covers christy's hair in the 
     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  there is no 
     question in his mind; the two are the same.  mike has a 
     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the 
     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.

     there is a live band on a small stage at one end of the 
     club.  they start playing a hot dance number, and the club 
     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  christy 
     and mary robert, both still seated, start to move with the 
     music.

     a very good-looking local dude comes over to the nuns 
     table.  he is clearly amused at their presence.

                               dude
               hey, sisters -- how you doin'?

                               christy
                             (flirting)
               better now.

                               dude
               how come they let you out?  out of that 
               convent place?

                               christy
               time off.  for bad behavior.

                               dude
               oww!  a nun havin' fun!  i don't believe 
               it!  it's good to have you ladies in this 
               fine establishment.  so... anybody on the 
               move?

                               mary robert
                             (standing up)
               i am.

     page 54.

                               christy
               bob!  what're you doing?

     mary robert leads the dude out onto the dance floor.

                               mary robert
               i'm getting experience.

                               christy
                             (to the dude)
               you watch yourself!

     christy decides she'd better keep an eye on mary robert; 
     she grabs another dude, and heads for the dance floor.

     as the music percolates, christy and mary robert dance;  
     christy is very hot, and mary robert picks up on her moves.  
     the club patrons are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start 
     to get down.

                               club patron #1
               do it, sisters!

                               club patron #2
               sway and pray!

     as the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the 
     club patrons cheer, shouting "hallelujah!" and "amen!"
