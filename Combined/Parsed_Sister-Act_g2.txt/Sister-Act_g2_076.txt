     the members of the choir are all gathered outside mother 
     superior's office, leaning close to the door and listening 
     to her harangue christy.  they are surprised to find 
     themselves joined suddenly by bishop o'hara, and part to 
     let him through.  he leans down to the keyhole and listens.
