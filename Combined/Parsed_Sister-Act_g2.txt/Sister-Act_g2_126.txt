     int. storage room

     vince and joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with 
     boxes.  christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, 
     with willy standing guard over her.

     christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in.  
     she seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity.

                               vince
                             (turning on the charm)
               babe.

     christy does not reply.

                               vince
               babe, what happened here?  look at you.

                               christy
               good evening, vincent.

                               vince
               what, vincent?  this is me, doll.  i 
               know you.  what did you think you were 
               doing?  running to the cops.  hiding out.  
               no, no.  you're sorry now, aren't you?

                               christy
               i am sorry for all my sins.  and yours.

     vince, willy and joey all look at each other, perplexed.

                               willy
               she's a nun, vince.

                               vince
                             (kneeling by christy)
               i love you, chris.  i always will.  i 
               gave you so much.  my time.  my 
               affection.  a big-time career.  and how 
               do you repay me?  what's the thanks i 
               get?  where's the loyalty, huh?  where's 
               the love?

                               christy
               you will be judged, vincent.  we all 
               will.

     vince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  he's getting 
     angry.

                               vince
               what do you mean -- judged?  i don't get 
               judged, baby.

                               vince (cont'd)
               and who are you to talk?  you were 
               nothing.  you couldn't even sing.  i must 
               have been out of my mind.

                               willy
               she's acting weird, vince.  ever since 
               we picked her up.

                               joey
               it's spooky.  it's like she ain't even 
               afraid or nothing.

     vince grabs the front of christy's habit and squeezes it 
     tightly around her throat.

                               vince
               she's afraid.  come on, tell the boys 
               you're afraid.

                               christy
                             (calmly)
               i feel sorry for you, vincent.  and i 
               forgive you.

     this really throws vince, and angers him further.  he 
     glares at christy, and then releases her.  he turns to joey 
     and willy.

                               vince
               who gives a damn?  waste her.

     joey and willy look a little unsure as vince storms out of 
     the room.
