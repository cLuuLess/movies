     int. casino entrance

     the nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks. 
     before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, 
     the sound of jackpots and crap tables.

                               mother superior
               brace yourselves, sisters.

     in unison, the nuns all cross themselves.

                               mother superior
               spread out and look for mary clarence. 
               try to blend in.

     the nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for 
     christy.
