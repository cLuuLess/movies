     int.convent corridor - day

     christy sits alone outside mother superior's office, 
     listening to the loud ticking of the clock on the wall. she 
     seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the 
     principal's office.

     the door opens and eddie emerges from the office.

                               christy
               what'd she say?

                               eddie
               you blew it -- big time.  she doesn't 
               want you back.

                               christy
               does she know people are trying to kill 
               me out there?

                               eddie
               she's counting on it.  she's concerned 
               for your safety, but she wants me to try 
               and find another convent that will take 
               you. or a carnival.

                               christy
               so what am i supposed to do in the 
               meantime?

                               eddie
               go in and talk to her.  it can't hurt. 
                             (urging her)
               go.

     reluctantly, christy rises and approaches the door.  she 
     looks at eddie, who motions her to go in.  she finally 
     does.
