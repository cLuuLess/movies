     christy still looks unsettled.

                               christy
               eddie -- i've got to go back.  they 
               won't sing without me.  i'm deserting 
               them.

                               eddie
               i think they'd understand.

                               christy
               that's not the point!  they need me!

     eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the 
     convent has had.

                               eddie
               they need you?  a bunch of nuns?  for 
               what?  moral guidance?  make-up tips?

                               christy
               you don't get it!  it's a big thing for 
               them, it's like... caesar's palace. 
               prime-time.  they're singing for the 
               cardinals.  it's like... "star search." 
               if first prize was a trip to the vatican.  
               they've worked really hard, they deserve 
               this.

                             (goading her)
               nuns?

                               christy
               they're not nuns.  they're like.. 
               people.  with one outfit.
