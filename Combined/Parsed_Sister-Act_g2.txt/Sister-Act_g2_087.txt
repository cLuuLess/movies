     int. cell

     shocked and terrified, christy struggles to free herself, 
     but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is eddie.

     page 78.

     eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed.

                               christy
               eddie!  you scared the hell out of me!

                               eddie
               what if i was vince?  you'd be dead 
               right now.  what are you doing giving 
               interviews on tv?

                               christy
               it wasn't my fault!  they just showed 
               up.  it's helping the convent.

                               eddie
               you're supposed to be hiding out!

                               christy
               i really can't talk about it now.  the 
               place is packed.  sro.  i've got a show 
               to do.

                               eddie
               listen to yourself.  this isn't a career 
               opportunity.

                               christy
               i know that.  this isn't about me.  it's 
               about the choir.  you should hear them.
               they're good.  really good.  and i 
               taught them.

                               eddie
               jesus, look at you   you're glowing.

                               christy
               i am?

                               eddie
               yeah.  you look... great.  i mean it..

                               christy
                             (flirting)
               really?  lieutenant?

                               eddie 
               i've been worried about you.

     eddie sits on the bed beside christy.

                               christy
               you mean -- worried about my testimony?

                               eddie
               no -- worried about you.  personally.

     page 79.

                               christy
               well..  thanks.  i've been thinking 
               about you.. - sometimes.  i mean, there 
               aren't a lot of guys around here.  i 
               mean, sometimes i feel like... a nun.

                               eddie
               me too.

                               christy
               you're not... seeing anybody?

                               eddie
               no.  most of the time i'm thinking about 
               you.  and now... you've really changed.

                               christy
               i have?

                               eddie
               you re sort of... radiant.   your eyes 
               are shining.  you're rea1ly different...

     eddie and christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they 
     are just about to kiss.  their lips are less than an inch 
     apart.

                               eddie
               you're... you're a nun.

     eddie and christy jump apart, their intimacy has 
     frightened them both, particularly given christy's outfit, 
     and their location.

                               christy
               we're in a convent!

     christy goes to the door.

                               christy
               i've got to go.

                               eddie
               just remember - you're a target.  don't 
               you think vince has a t.v.?

                               christy
                             (trying to think 
                             straight)
               i know, i know.  i'll be careful.  i'll 
               try.

     christy begins to leave, and then she turns, filled with a 
     performer's excitement.

                               christy
               magic time!

     page 80.

     christy hurries toward the chapel, leaving eddie to shake 
     his head and wonder.
