     joey and willy find vince near the bar.

     page 105.

                               vince
               it's done?

                               joey
               not... totally.

                               vince
                             (disturbed)
               what's the problem?

                               willy
               she's... she's a nun.

                               vince
               are you nuts?  she's not a nun.  it's 
               christy.  she's a babe!

                               joey
               but, vince, how do you know she didn't 
               like, join up and become a nun when she 
               was in that convent?

                               vince
               it didn't happen.

                               willy
               she was real quiet and peaceful all the 
               way back in the car.

                               joey
               no smart-ass remarks or nothing.

                               vince
               i can't believe this.  okay, i want both 
               you guys to go back there, and both of 
               you shoot her at the same time.

                               joey
               yeah...

                               willy
               right.  that way we'd never know which 
               bullet got to her brain and killed her 
               first.  it could always be the other guy.

     they all look happy with this solution as joey and willy 
     leave.
