     ext. convent

     church services are over, and happy people stream out of 
     the convent, but they don't hurry home.  standing in 
     groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. 
     there is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the 
     block.

     eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, 
     smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car.
