     int. choir rehearsal room - day

     the choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn 
     let thy thoughts he guided.  christy is not singing; she 
     is clearly in pain.  mary lazarus stops the song.  one of 
     the nuns has to nudge sister alma to stop her playing.

                               mary lazarus
               mary clarence, are you with us?

                               christy
               um, i don't really know this one...

                               mary robert
               mary clarence has a background in music. 
               that's what reverend mother said.

                               mary patrick
                             (eagerly)
               really, mary clarence?  were you a 
               choirmistress?

                               christy
               sure.  kind of... free-lance.

                               mary lazarus
                             (circling christy)
               free-lance?  oh really?  you think i 
               don't see?  you think i took vows 
               yesterday?  i know what you're up to. you 
               and reverend mother.

                               christy
               what?

                               mary lazarus
               you're a ringer.  she brought you in to 
               replace me.  out with the old.

     page 62.

                               christy
               hold on.

                               mary patrick
               mary clarence, could you?  mary lazarus, 
               you're terrific, but...
                             (to christy)
               could you help us?

                               another nun
               please?

                               another nun
               you've heard us.

                               mary lazarus
               well.

     everyone falls silent.  mary lazarus walks across the 
     room, eyeballing each member of the choir.

                               mary lazarus
               there's a word for this -- mutiny.
                             (to christy)
               so, mary clarence, you think you can do 
               better.  i believe i'd like to see that.
                             (she hands christy her 
                             pitchpipe and baton)
               i'm out to pasture.  dry dock.  the glue 
               factory.  go ahead, sister -- make 'em 
               sing.

     everyone watches christy.

                               christy
               well...
                             (to nary lazarus)
               with all due respect... let's have a 
               look at this.

     christy goes over to the piano.  she examines the sheet 
     music for "let they thoughts he guided."  she sits at the 
     piano, beside sister alma.  christy picks out the hymn on 
     the piano, accompanying herself.

                               christy
               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed

     christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  she 
     stops singing.  for perhaps the first time in her life, she 
     has really heard herself.

                               christy
               man.  i sound like you guys.

     page 63.

                               mary lazarus
                             (victorious)
               very nice.  sisters, have we learned our 
               lesson?  i won't hold this little episode 
               against anyone.  i'll try not to.

                               christy
                             (standing)
               mary robert.

     mary robert jumps, startled by the attention. 

                               mary robert
               what?

                               christy
               mary robert, i've watched you.  you 
               never really sing.  you whisper. nothing 
               comes out.

                               mary robert
               i don't want to mess anyone up...

                               christy
                             (to sister alma)
               give me a c.
                             (because sister alma 
                             is hard of hearing)
               a c!

     sister alma plays the note.  christy points the baton at 
     mary robert.  mary robert whispers the note.

                               christy
               louder!  like you're onstage.

     mary robert sings a little louder.

                               christy
               like people are eating, and there's 
               silverware, and you want them to hear 
               you.

     mary robert sings louder still.

                               christy
               think about that guy you were dancing 
               with!

     mary robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge 
     and glorious.  after singing a single perfect note, she 
     stops abruptly; she has scared herself.

                               mary robert
               oh my!

     page 64.

                               christy
               you see?  we've got the voices.  they're 
               just allover the place. i've heard all of 
               you, in the shower --you're decent.  
               better than me.  we just need charts -- 
               harmony -- chops.

                               mary patrick
                             (puzzled)
               chops?

                               christy
               the goods.  the sound.  the sale.  let's 
               rearrange a few things.  mary patrick, 
               you re not a natural soprano, you're an 
               alto.  get over here.  mary robert --with 
               the sopranos.

     the two nuns trade places.

                               christy
               sister alma -- a c.

     sister alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate 
     it, but the results aren't much better than before. christy 
     uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving 
     each her note, urging them closer to pitch.

                               christy
               middle section, hold that note, for dear 
               life.  sopranos, an a.  sister alma?

     sister alma hits the note.  christy shuffles a couple of 
     more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going 
     with the altos, using her pitchpipe.

     for one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a 
     perfect chord.  they are elated.

                               mary patrick
               we did it!  we actually sang a chord!

                               mary robert
                             (thrilled and 
                             disconcerted)
               that was exciting!

                               christy
               yeah, for one second.  that was the 
               blend -- you've got to listen to each 
               other.  be a group.

                               mary lazarus
                             (under her breath)
               i knew that.

                               christy
               mary lazarus, i get the feeling that you 
               like discipline.  hard work.

     page 65.

                               mary lazarus
               of course.  i'm a nun.  four popes now.  
               the lord hates a loafer.

                               christy
               i hear you.  how many days a week do you 
               rehearse?

                               mary patrick
               two days.  an hour or so.

                               christy
               no way.  we're a choir, right? 
               headliners.  the big room.  two days a 
               week won't cut it.  every day.

                               mary lazarus
                             (impressed)
               she's good.

                               mary robert
                             (to christy)
               do you really think we could do it?  get 
               better?

                               christy
               i don't know.  mary lazarus, what do you 
               think?  they're pretty raw.

                               mary lazarus
               wet behind the ears.

                               christy
               a bunch of real mama's girls.

                               mary patrick
               oh, please?  can't we try?

     christy and mary lazarus look at each other, as real 
     comrades.  christy leans on mary lazarus' shoulder.

                               christy
               it'll be hell.

                               mary lazarus
               tell me about it.

     christy and mary lazarus shake hands, firmly.  christy 
     turns to the choir, very businesslike.

                               christy
               ten-hut!
