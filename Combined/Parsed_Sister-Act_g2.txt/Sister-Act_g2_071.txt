     as usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns. 
     the choir is in place behind the pulpit.

                               bishop o'hara
               the choir, i am told, has elected a new 
               director -- sister mary clarence, who 
               will lead them in hymn 127.

     christy nods to the bishop, and signals to sister alma, 
     who begins the accompaniment.

                               choir
               let thy thoughts be guided
               let thy soul be healed

     they sound fantastic.  their voices blend with a heavenly 
     harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn.  mother 
     superior is startled by this new sound.
