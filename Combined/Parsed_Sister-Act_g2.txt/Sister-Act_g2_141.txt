     we see two long rows of slot machines, with gamblers 
     working every machine.

     willy appears at one end of the row, scanning the area for 
     christy.  he sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row, 
     and she moves out of sight.  willy heads in that direction. 
     someone hits a jackpot behind him, and he turns toward the 
     sound.  as he does. he sees another nun crossing at the 
     opposite end of the row of machines.  willy turns again --
     now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end.  he 
     looks confused, and doesn't know which way to turn.
