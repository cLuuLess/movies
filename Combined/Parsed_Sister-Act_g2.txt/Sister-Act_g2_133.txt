     int. storage room - night

     joey and willy return to the storage room, looking 
     confident of their mission this time.  christy glances up 
     at them as they enter, and willy begins to untie her.

                               willy
               we got it all worked out.

     he works the ropes free, and christy rubs her wrists to 
     get circulation back again.

                               joey
               okay, christy -- strip.

                               christy
               what?

                               joey
               that... thing.  that nun thing.  take it 
               off.

     christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.

                               willy
               what's she doing?

                               joey
               she's praying.

                               christy
               and god bless joey and willy, who are 
               only trying to do their jobs.
                             (faking latin)
               pox fibula tibia vobiscum.  et marcus 
               domino's pizza.  have mercy.  amen.
                             (she looks up at the 
                             guys)
               i'm finished now.  help me up.

     as joey and willy bend down to help her up, christy 
     suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand.  with a fierce 
     jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing 
     joey's head against willy's.

     stunned, joey and willy stagger backward, holding their 
     heads.  christy scrambles out the door while the two men 
     groan in pain.
