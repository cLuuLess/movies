     int. eddie's car - day

     eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel 
     gauge is close to empty.  he wheels into a gas station and 
     pulls up to the tanks.  christy starts to open the door, 
     but he stops her.

                               eddie
               what're you doing?

                               christy
               even nuns have to pee.

     he lets her go, then gets out to pump gas.
