     ext. convent - day

     the nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the 
     convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, 
     shining suns.  the camera pans to christy, who is adding 
     her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray 
     paint.  christy's section includes an image of a nun in a 
     miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that 
     read "st. kate!"  people gather in the street, watching the 
     nuns' activities.  the convent begins to crackle with 
     energy and life.

     a drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the 
     dealers give only a curious glance to the action at the 
     convent.
