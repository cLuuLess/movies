     int. vince's office - day

     vince is on the telephone in his office at the moonlight 
     hotel and casino.  he clearly has a new mistress or two.

                               vince
                             (very seductive)
               baby, you know i do... of course... i 
               feel it too... i'm blushing... can you 
               hold?

     a second telephone rings, and willy answers it.  vince 
     meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved 
     in a second romantic call.

                               vince
               soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... 
               how lonely?

                               willy
               it's that call you were expecting, 
               vince.

                               vince
               can you hold?  can you try?

     willy passes the phone to vince. t

               to try making it on a cop's salary?  find 
               her, and find her now!

     vince passes the phone back to willy.

                               vince
               raise the ante to three hundred grand.

     willy heads for the fax machine.  vince regains his 
     composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.

                               vince

               stitch?... yeah, i'm naked too... 
               inside...
