     int. mother superior's office

     the office is bare and austere.  mother superior sits at 
     her desk with her hands folded.  like all the nuns at the 
     convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and 
     wimple.

     mother superior is in total command of all she surveys, 
     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as 
     she rules.  control is her passion; within the walls of the 
     convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's 
     a world she controls.

               but mother superior is not in control at 
               this particular moment.  bishop george 
               o'hara stands before her with a majestic 
               presence and some bad news.

                               mother superior
               absolutely not.  i am very sorry, but 
               no.

                               o'hara
               we can save this young woman's life, and 
               imprison a parasite -- all in one 
               gesture.

                               mother superior
               but she's been exposed to the underside 
               of life.  she is the underside of life.

                               o'hara
               and therefore an ideal prospect for 
               rehabilitation.

                               mother superior
               we're a small convent, bishop.  surely 
               there are... more appropriate shelters.

                               o'hara
               your small convent is in danger of 
               closing, reverend mother.  the las vegas 
               police department has offered to make a 
               generous financial donation.

                               mother superior
               but, bishop...

                               o'hara
               st. katherine's is a benedictine order. 
               you have taken a vow of hospitality.  to 
               all in need.

                               mother superior
               i lied.

                               o'hara
               i know.
                             (smiling)

     mother superior's jaw locks.  she realizes she is stuck 
     with the situation and will have to control it as best she 
     can.  there is a knock at the door, and eddie and christy 
     enter.

                               o'hara
               welcome, lieutenant.  everything is in 
               order.

                               eddie
               aces.  bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, 
               down at the corner?

     the thought of being left alone with mother superior 
     panics christy, like a child left in the principal's 
     office.

                               christy
               hey, you're not leaving me alone...

                               o'hara
                             (reassuringly)
               you're never alone in this house, my 
               child.

     eddie touches her gently on the arm.

                               eddie
               one month, two tops.  behave yourself.

                               mother superior
               bishop...
                             (a last-ditch attempt)

                               o'hara
                             (opening the door to 
                             leave)
               lieutenant?

                                                          cut to:
