     int. lounge - night

     a spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage.  the 
     man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an 
     elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks 
     and style.

                               elvis
               good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  are 
               you lonesome tonight?  welcome to the 
               moonlight hotel and casino's incredible 
               platinum oldies spectacular.

     backstage, there's still a look of resolve in christy's 
     eye as she waits to go on with michelle and tina, her back-
     up singers.

                               michelle
               but you can't quit.  what'll happen to 
               us?
                             (to tina)
               tell her she can't quit.

                               tina
               i told her.  she stuck pantyhose in my 
               mouth.

     onstage, elvis glances into the wings to be sure the 
     ronelles are ready.

                               elvis
               please welcome our own girl group 
               extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty --
               the fabulous ronelles!

     elvis disappears.  the spotlight hits christy, who wears a 
     high beehive wig and a sequinned, early supremes-style 
     gown.  michelle and tina wear matching gowns and wigs.  the 
     band begins a doo-wop vamp.

                               christy
               oh, girls.

                               ronelles
               yes, betty?

                               christy
               this prom is a real drag.

                               ronelles
               oh-huh.

                               christy
               oh my!
                             (gasping)

                               ronelles
               what is it, betty?

                               christy
               look at that.  get a gander.

                               ronelles
               oh my!
                             (sighing)

                               christy
               he's so dreamy.  he's like... a greek 
               god.  he's the cutest guy here.    he's 
               boss.  he's fab.  he's...

                               ronelles
               yes, betty?

                               christy
                             (singing)
               he's so fine.

                               ronelles
               d00-lang, doo-lang, d00-lang.

                               christy
               wish he was mine.  that handsome boy 
               over there, the one with the wavy hair.

     as they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully 
     choreographed in vintage girl group style.

     page 7.

     a lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the 
     number.  while christy does her best, her singing voice is 
     not on a par with those of the other ronelles.

     the lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few 
     drunken shriners and a couple of college kids.  police 
     lieutenant eddie mulcahy sits at a ringside table with his 
     eyes locked on christy.  an easygoing charmer, eddie gives 
     her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a 
     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.
