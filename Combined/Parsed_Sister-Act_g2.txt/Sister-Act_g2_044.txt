     int. hallway outside bathing room - a few minutes later

     christy is standing on line in the hall, along with 
     several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers.  they 
     carry soap and towels.

                             (sincerely)
               isn't it a glorious morning?  good 
               morning, mary clarence.  sleep well?

                               christy
               right.

                               mary robert
               is this like your old convent?

                               mary patrick
               which convent was that, sister?

                               christy
               which convent?  it was, um, the little 
               sisters... of the moonlight.  in vegas. 
               everybody used to come to mass.  frank. 
               dean.  sammy.  right at ringside. 

                               mary lazarus
               enough jabber.

     mary lazarus is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, 
     a hard-liner.

                               christy
               what?

                               mary lazarus
               progressive convents.  vanity.  it 
               sounds awful.  it sounds just like this 
               place.

                               christy
               like this place?

                               mary lazarus
               i like my old convent, in vancouver. out 
               in the woods.  it wasn't all modern, like 
               here.  no electricity.  cold water. bare 
               feet.  those were nuns.  it was hell on 
               earth, but i loved it.  this place is a 
               hilton.
