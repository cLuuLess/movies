     ext. convent hallway

     all the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and 
     nightshirts, down the hallway.

     christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and 
     her hair is a mess.

                               christy
               what?

     mary robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.

                               mary robert
               come on, we're late.

                               christy
               what?  what time is it?

                               mary robert
               it's after five.  we have to bathe.

                               christy
                             (groaning)
               five a.m.?
