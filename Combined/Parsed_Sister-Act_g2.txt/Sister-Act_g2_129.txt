     christy still shows no signs of fear as joey and willy 
     take out their guns.

                               joey
               okay, we got one-two-three, and on three 
               we both shoot.  got it?

                               willy
               got it.

     joey points his gun at christy's left temple, and willy 
     points his gun at her right temple.

                               joey
               one... two...

     christy closes her eyes.

                               joey
               three!

     neither man shoots.  they look at each other with anger. 
     christy opens her eyes.

                               joey
               you didn't shoot!

                               willy
               neither did you!

                               joey
               i figured if you were gonna, then i 
               wouldn't have to.

                               willy
