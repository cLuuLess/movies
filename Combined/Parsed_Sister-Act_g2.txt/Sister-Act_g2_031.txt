     int. convent changing room

     a small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, 
     and several wooden cabinets.  there is a wooden screen in a 
     corner, marking a changing area.  christy is behind the 
     screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  mother superior 
     stands beside the screen, catching the various items of 
     clothing which christy tosses to her.

                               christy (o.s.)
               how about a robe?  one of those big 
               terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on 
               the pocket.  "guest of st. katherine's"

                               mother superior
               would you like that?

     mother superior takes christy's skirt and blouse, and 
     tosses them down a chute marked "incinerator."

                               christy (o.s.)
               you should hand-wash that blouse, and 
               send somebody out for some things.  i 
               look good in reds, purples, hot pink --
               and shoes.  five-inch heels.  fuck-me 
               pumps.  oh, man -- sorry.   'scuse my 
               mouth.

     mother superior carries christy's lacy bra at the end of a 
     ruler; it goes down the incinerator.

                               mother superior
               excused.  open the cabinet to your left. 
               you will find appropriate attire.

                               christy (o.s.)
               can do.
