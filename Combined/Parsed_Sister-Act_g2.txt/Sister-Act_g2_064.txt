     ext. convent - night

     christy and mary robert run up to the side door of the 
     convent; they catch their breath.

                               mary robert
               what was all that?  who was that man?  
               why would he shoot at us?

                               christy
               i don't know, some people just don't 
               like nuns.  i wish i had a ruler.

                               mary robert
               we could have been killed!  but you 
               saved me!
                             (throwing her arms 
                             around christy)
               thank you, mary clarence!

     the door to the convent swings open.  mother superior is 
     waiting.

                               mother superior
               yes -- thank you so much.
