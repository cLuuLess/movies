     int. casino

     vince, joey and willy run into each other in the center of 
     the casino.

                               willy
               there's nuns everywhere!  hundreds of 
               'em!

     all the nuns suddenly come together, and see that the 
     exits are blocked by vince and his hoods.  vince spots 
     christy in the center of the group.

                               vince
               there she is!

                               joey
               which one?

     christy sees vince pointing at her.

                               christy
               quick, there's another way out of here.  
               follow me.

     christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one 
     side.  the other nuns follow her.

                               vince
               she's heading for the lounge!  go!

     vince, joey and willy head for the lounge.

     across the room, eddie sees christy and the cluster of 
     nuns head through the glass doors.  he barks into his 
     walkie-talkie.

                               eddie
               move in -- now!
