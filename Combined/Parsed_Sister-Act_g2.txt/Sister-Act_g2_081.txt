     int. rehearsal room - day

     the rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir 
     is separated into several groups.  christy has got the 
     whole thing running like a disciplined broadway cast.

     mary patrick leads one group in the corner as they 
     practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  colorful 
     streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make 
     colorful patterns in the air.

     sister alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as mary 
     robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes 
     they've only dreamed of in the past.

     christy and mary lazarus have corralled the rest of the 
     nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat 
     like the temptations in skirts.  mary lazarus keeps the 
     beat with a yardstick.

                               christy
               don't look at your feet, and i don't 
               want to see anybody counting.  make it 
               look easy.  again!

                               mary lazarus
               right, right, cross with the left, spin 
               and turn!

                               christy 
               hopeless i

               again!
