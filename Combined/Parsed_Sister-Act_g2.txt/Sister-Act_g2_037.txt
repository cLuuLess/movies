     ext. convent vegetable garden - day

     the vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a 
     patch of land surrounded by high walls.  various sections 
     have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.

     several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. 
     they wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.

     christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  she is 
     hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  she picks up 
     a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see 
     if anyone is watching.  she starts to gnaw on the carrot.  
     she becomes aware that someone is watching her.  she looks 
     up.

     sister mary robert is watching christy eat the carrot, 
     breaking her fast.  christy drops the carrot on the ground, 
     as if it burned her.  mary robert resumes hoeing in the 
     next furrow over.

     christy stares at mary robert, narrowing her eyes.  
     christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their 
     tasks.  christy decides that she will try and make sister 
     mary  robert talk.  she picks up the carrot and tosses it 
     at mary robert.  mary robert jumps.  she waggles a finger 
     at christy, scolding her.  mary robert resumes hoeing.

     christy is now determined.  she takes her hoe, and tiptoes 
     nearer to mary robert.  very gently, she uses the handle of 
     the floe to lift mary robert's skirt, and gooses her.

     mary robert vips, very loudly.  all the other nuns turn 
     and stare at mary robert, scolding her.  christy waggles 
     her finger at mary robert, scolding her.

     christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  she sees 
     mother superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  mother 
     superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.
