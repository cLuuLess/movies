     ext. crack house - night

     one of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as 
     a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.  he starts toward the 
     car as the driver rolls down the window, but before he gets 
     there, christy and several nuns surround the car.

                               christy
               we're here to pray for you, brother.

                               dealer
               what?  get the hell out of here.

                               christy
               we know you don't want to sell drugs.  
               you just had an unhappy childhood, and 
               maybe a learning disability.  you just 
               need someone to pray for you.

                               mary patrick
               we know you don't want to bring pain and 
               misery to your friends and neighbors. 
               we'll pray to find you some honest work.

                               christy
               and we know that, even though most 
               people would call you a leech and a 
               parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! we 
               know that deep down inside, you're 
               probably even worse.  and so you truly 
               need our prayers.

                               driver
               what is this?  outta my way!

     the nuns give him room, and the driver zips off down the 
     street.  a small crowd has begun to gather, and it is 
     growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the 
     nuns.  christy turns to the dealer, as other cars drive 
     slowly past.

                               christy
               yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers 
               free  we're going to give free prayers to 
               everyone who drives up to this house.

                               mary robert
                             (to the dealer)
               we're nuns!

                               mary patrick
                             (to cruising cars)
               free prayers right over here!  drive up 
               and get your prayers!

                               dealer
               you're hassling my customers!  that's 
               not legal!  i know my rights.  this is 
               restriction of trade.

                               christy
               you wanna call a cop?

     page 76.

     the dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his 
     pocket.  mary patrick steps forward.

                               mary patrick
               are you going to shoot us all, tough 
               guy?

                               mary lazarus
               is it worth it?  a lot of witnesses 
               here.

                               christy
                             (to the crowd)
               can i get a witness?

     the dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns 
     a disgusted look.  he puts the gun away.

                               dealer
               so i'll find another neighborhood to do 
               my business.  you can' t stop me.

                               christy
               if we can stop you here, they can stop 
               you there.

     the dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. 
     the crowd applauds and cheers.

     the picture suddenly becomes grainy, and we hear the voice 
     of a news reporter.

                               news reporter (v.0.)
               it was a truly remarkable scene, as the 
               nuns from st. katherine's literally drove 
               the crack dealers from the neighborhood, 
               led by the feisty sister mary clarence.

     camera pulls back and we see a tv screen with an image of 
     the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.  on top of the tv 
     are several framed photographs of vince laflocca, his wife 
     and children.
