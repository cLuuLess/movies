     int. convent crafts room

     this is a large, open room where the nuns create various 
     gift items which the convent sells to support itself.  
     several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting 
     christmas cards and making christmas tree ornaments.

     on the other side of the room is a large, free-standing 
     loom, which resembles a grand piano.  the loom is wooden; a 
     tapestry is half-completed.  mary patrick is seated at the 
     loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  christy stands 
     beside her.

                               mary patrick
               the minute i saw you. i said to myself, 
               she's a weaver.  have you ever used a 
               loom?

                               christy
               not in years.

                               mary patrick
               well, it all comes back, in just a 
               jiffy.  i'm working on a wall-hanging, of 
               the convent.

                               christy
               why?

                               mary patrick
               to sell, of course.  i hate to say it, 
               but we're in terrible trouble here at st. 
               katherine's.  we need a new roof, the 
               furnace is going, and there's no money.

                               christy
               but don't you get money?  from the 
               vatican?

                               mary patrick
               mary clarence.  goose.  we're completely 
               self-supporting.  like all convents. like 
               yours.

                               christy
               oh, right.  at my old place, we used 
               to... wash cars.  groom dogs.  so... nice 
               loom.

                               mary patrick
               isn't it lovely?  now i'll demonstrate, 
               and then you can hop right in.
                             (as she deftly works 
                             the loom)
               you just draw your beater in, keep it 
               pressed against the pick, and open the 
               shed.  then pass your shuttle, beat, and 
               open the next shed.  shuttle. beat, beat, 
               shuttle, beat, shed.  keep tension on the 
               warp.  is that clear?

                               christy
                             (pretending to be 
                             fascinated)
               just about.  show me again.

                               mary patrick
               you betcha.

     angle on the wall hanging, which has progressed 
     considerably.

     angle on christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing 
     through a magazine.

     angle on mary patrick, hard at work at the loom.

                               mary patrick
               shuttle, beat, shed.  and watch your 
               heddles.

                               christy
               i love my heddles.  show me again.

     mother superior appears.

                               mother superior
               mary clarence -- how is your weaving 
               progressing?

                               mary patrick
               oh, she's doing just fine, reverend 
               mother -

     page 45.

                               christy
               really catching on.

                               mother superior
               good.  mary patrick, i need you in the 
               office.  mary clarence, carry on.

     mother superior gestures to the loom.  christy sits at the 
     loom, and waves as mother superior and mary patrick exit.

     christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her 
     face.  she has not been paying attention to mary patrick's 
     instructions.  she cracks her knuckles, as if she were 
     about to play the piano.  she grabs two parts of the loom, 
     at random.  she moves these parts.

     angle on the loom.  as a result of christy's movements, 
     the loom collapses, piece by piece.  the tapestry unravels, 
     the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus 
     disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and 
     falls to the floor, as christy watches, aghast.
