     int. convent hallway - that night

     this hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors 
     with tiny, grilled windows.  these are the cells where the 
     nuns sleep.  nuns are entering their cells and closing 
     their doors for the night.

     mother superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, 
     bedraggled christy.  christy is devouring a slice of brown 
     bread.

                               christy
               is this all the food i get?

                               mother superior
               yes.  until breakfast.

                               christy
               that's tomorrow!  don't you have any 
               snacks?  machines?

     they stop by a door.

                               mother superior
               this shall be your cell, mary clarence.

                               christy
               my what?

                               mother superior
               your cell.  your room.
