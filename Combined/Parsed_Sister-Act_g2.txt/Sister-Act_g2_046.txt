     int. chapel - a few minutes later

     bishop o'hara is leading the sunday mass.  he stands in 
     the pulpit.  the choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to 
     his left.  the remaining nuns, including christy and mother 
     superior, sit in the first few pews.

                               o'hara
               we are a small congregation this 
               morning.  too many mornings.  something 
               has gone terribly wrong.   where is 
               faith?  where is celebration?  where is 
               everyone?  still, rather than regret the 
               absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice 
               in the fellowship of those present.  our 
               choirmistress, sister mary lazarus, has 
               informed me that our choir, while always 
               superior, has been toiling especially 
               hard on this week's selection.  sister?

     mary lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins 
     singing. they sing a traditional hymn, "let thy thoughts be 
     guided." as always, their singing is dreadful; they have no 
     tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.

     as the hymn continues, the camera pans over the chapel. 
     aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly 
     people are in attendance.

     angle on christy

     sitting with the other nuns.  she is clearly about to fall 
     asleep.  then the choir hits a particularly horrendous 
     note, and christy jerks awake.  she immediately tries to 
     assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her 
     hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented sunday 
     school calendar.
