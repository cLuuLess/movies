ext.  colosseum - arena - day

maximus defeats his opponent.  he stands over him.  he
does not kill him.

he tosses his sword down and walks away.  the crowd goes
crazy, roaring their approval of maximus.

senator falco, sits in the stands and watches with some
alarm.  he glances around as the crowd exalts maximus.  he
is becoming a hero to the people.

the drums continue...
