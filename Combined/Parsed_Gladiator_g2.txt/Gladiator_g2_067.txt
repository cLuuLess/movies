int.  colosseum - holding cells - day

finally, proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their
holding cells.  these cells are right at the edge of the
arena.  barred windows offer a sand-level view of the
action.

maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out.

he cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does
see transfixes him.

a band of christians are huddled together.  an eerie
silence from the colosseum but for the prayers of the
christians.

maximus watches them.  one little girl peels past her
mother's arm.  she sees maximus.  she smiles.

suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by maximus
-- they roar into the arena --

we do not see the carnage.  we watch maximus' face as we
hear the sounds of the slaughter.

and the sound of the roaring crowd.

maximus finally cannot watch.  he drops his head.
