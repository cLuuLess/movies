ext.  colosseum - arena - day

the colosseum is again packed.  commodus, lucilla and her
son lucius are in the imperial box.

it is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the
arena after a bout.  they haul off carcasses and toss down
fresh sand.

meanwhile, cassius is orating to the crowd:

					cassius
		... in his majestic charity the
		emperor has deigned to this day
		favor the people of rome with an
		historical final match.  returning
		to the colosseum today... after five
		years in retirement... caesar is
		pleased to bring you... the only
		undefeated champion in roman
		history...
			(the crowd is going
			mad)
		... the legendary... tiger of gaul!!

the crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as tiger explodes
into the arena in an ornate chariot.  tiger is a fierce
man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely
muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena.

tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot,
raising an arm in triumph.  the crowd roars.
