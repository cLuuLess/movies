ext.  road - sunset

maximus and marcus are now walking along a road through
the dense forest.  slaves follow behind them, leading
their horses.

both sides of the road are filled with the men of the
felix regiment.  as maximus and marcus pass, the battered
and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising
their swords, paying silent homage.

					maximus
		they honor you, caesar.

					marcus
		i don't think they're standing for
		me, maximus.  they honor you.

just then commodus canters into view with his praetorian
guard escort.  he watches the army honor maximus with rank
envy as he nears.

he rides up to maximus and marcus.

					commodus
		have i missed it?

he leaps from his horse.

					commodus
		have i missed the battle?

					marcus
		you've missed the war.  we're done
		here.

commodus embraces him, awkward.

					commodus
		father.  congratulations.  i shall
		sacrifice a thousand doves to honor
		your triumph.

					marcus
		spare the doves and honor maximus,
		he won the battle.

commodus embraces maximus, even more awkward.

					commodus
		general, rome salutes you and i
		embrace you as a brother.

					maximus
		highness.

they walk, maximus still supporting marcus, as:

					commodus
		your spaniards seem invincible.  may
		the gods favor the felix regiment
		now and always...
			(to his father)
		here, father, take my arm.

					marcus
			(ignores this)
		where's your sister?

					commodus
		she's at the camp.  she had no
		desire to see the gore of the
		battlefield.

					marcus
			(smiles)
		lucilla would eat every corpse here
		if it brought her one step closer to
		the throne.

maximus laughs.

					maximus
			(smiles)
		caesar, you do the lady injustice.

					marcus
		it's a foolish old cobra who doesn't
		recognize his own off-spring...
			(he suddenly stops,
			not feeling well)
		i think... i should ride now.

maximus waves for marcus' horse.  it is brought up.
several soldiers carefully help the old man into the
saddle.  he is then tethered to the brace on his saddle.
it is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the
emperor of rome.

when at last he is strapped in, he looks to maximus.

					marcus
		so much for the glory of rome.

without a word to his son, marcus nods and the horse is
slowly lead away.

commodus and maximus watch him go.

					commodus
			(neutral)
		he's dying.

a beat.

					commodus
		poor old man.

					maximus
			(terse)
		if you'll excuse me, highness.

he turns and stalks away.
