int.  tent corridor - night

marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor
attached.

he sees his daughter lucilla in the corridor, spying in
through the slit in the tent wall.  he watches her,
smiles.

					marcus
		if only you had been born a man...

she turns to him.  he leaves his body slaves and goes to
her.

					lucilla
		father.

					marcus
		what a caesar you would have made.

					lucilla
		you're right.

					marcus
		i think you would have been strong.
		i wonder if you would have been
		just?

					lucilla
		i would have been what you taught me
		to be.

a beat.  they stare at each other.  he finally smiles.

					marcus
		well, pretend to be my loving
		daughter tonight and walk with me to
		my chamber.

she smiles and takes his arm.  they slowly walk down the
tent corridor as:

					marcus
		this is a pleasant fiction, isn't
		it?

they disappear into darkness.
