int.  marcus' tent - night

commodus' eyes are red with weeping.  he sits, head down,
at the foot of marcus' bed and speaks to his father.

					commodus
			(quietly)
		i search the faces of the gods for
		ways to please you... to make you
		proud... and i can never do it.  one
		kind word -- one full hug where you
		pressed me to your chest and held me
		tight -- would have been like the
		sun on my heart for a thousand
		years... what is it in me you hate
		so much?  my eyes are your eyes.  my
		hands are your hands.  all i have
		ever wanted was to live up to you.
		caesar.  father.

he stands.  we see that he is holding the scroll denoting
marcus' intention to nominate maximus as emperor to the
senate.  commodus cannot control his tears.

					commodus
		why does maximus deserve what i
		could never have? -- why do you love
		his eyes over mine? -- i would
		butcher the whole world -- if you
		would only love me...

commodus weeps.
