int.  maximus' tent - night

maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  he faces
six small figures that represent his dead ancestors.

					maximus
		ancestors, true bloodline, i ask you
		for your guidance.  bring me your
		solace and your wisdom.  blessed
		mother, come to me in my dreams with
		the gods' desire for my future.
		blessed father, watch over my wife
		and my son with a ready sword.  keep
		them safe until my return.  whisper
		to them in their sleep that i live
		only to hold them again and all else
		is dust and air.  ancestors, true
		bloodline, i honor you and will try
		to live with the dignity you have
		taught me.

he looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows
out the candles around them.
