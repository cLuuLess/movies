algren walks through the village, past the swordsmith who is now honing the blade, carefully sharpening it.

.ext.                    cherry tree forest                              day

algren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village. the pink and red blossoms are dazzling
and abundant. other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms.

it is a place of otherworldly beaut y.

it is all so beautiful that algren just stops. takes it in for a moment. he reaches out and touches a blossom.

                                             katsumoto (o.s.)
                            a perfect blossom is a rare thing...

algren turns. katsumoto is kneeling nearby, meditating.

                                             ka tsumoto
                            you could spend your life looking for one.
                            and it would not be a wasted life.

                                            algren
                            were you praying?

                                                katsumoto
                            just sitting... i do not think i have the word.
                            satori it means, maybe, awareness.

                                               algren
                            of what?

                                              katsumoto
                            this moment alone, apart from all others ... you
                            know this?
                                     (algren shakes his head)
                            i am writing a poem about this time we hive spent.
                            i have only written one line on "his eyes were like my
                            own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean."
                            can you suggest a second line?

                                             algren
                            i'm not much of a writer.

                                              ka tsumoto
                            is this why you spend so much time with your journal?

                                                                                     56.

                        .                     algren
                             how do you know that?
                                      (no answer)
                             she told you.

katsumoto appraises algren.

                                              algren
                             did you love her husband as your own son?

                                             ka tsumoto
                             you have sent men to their deaths, just as i have.

                                                algren
                             the difference is, you feel nothing.

                                              ka tsumoto
                             before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.

                                              algren
                             what does that have to do with anything?

                                               ka tsumoto
                             you lived on a farm. or in a forest of trees.

                                            algren
                             how do you know?

                                              ka tsumoto
                             the wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.

                                               algren
                                      (reluctantly)
                             we lived in a place called connecticut. my...brother
                             and i climbed the maple trees.

                                              ka tsumoto
                             were they beautiful?

                                               algren
                             yes.


                                              katsumoto
                            and you were sad to see them die in the winter.

a beat. something flickers in algren's eyes.

                                             katsumoto
                             you were something before you were a soldier. you
                             were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the
                             trees die.

katsumoto looks at him deepl y.

                                                                                              57.
                                                ka tsumoto
                             like those trees, we are all dying. the future is
                             an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion.
                             we live life in every breath. eat, drink, fuck. now. every cup
                             of tea. every word we write... every blossom we hold.

he smiles sadly.


                                               ka tsumoto
                             every life we take.

a beat. he stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard.


                                               katsumoto
                             life in every breath. that is bushido. the wa y of the
                             samurai.

he goes. algren stands for a moment deep in thought
