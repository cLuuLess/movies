taka moves through the cherry orchard.

                           but i like to think he may have found at last
                           some small measure of the peace we all seek,
                           but few of us ever find.

taka stops. watching. we follow her gaze to discover:

algren, sitting alone. gazing peacefully sat the cherry bl ossoms.


waiting for the perfect one. he turns to her, a smile of quiet joy spreads
across his face.

                                             graham (v.o.)

fade out.
