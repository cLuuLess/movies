int.                      council of state chamber                          night

the council of state meets in an august chamber. many of the council
members wear western clothes. cigarette smoke billows.

the young emperor sits on a dais off to the side, as befits his
ceremonial role in the proceedings.

omura is speaking ... be stops ... looking at something ... all the council members turn ... and gape.


katsumoto strides into the chamber, his swords proudly displayed.

                                              omura
                                    (subtitled)
                           minister katsumoto, you honor us.

                                                                                            84.
                                              katsumoto
                                    (subtitled)
                          it is my honor to join again the men who are leading
                          japan into her glorious future.

                                            omura
                                  (subtitled)
                          you arc perhaps unaware of this council's edict
                          regarding the wearing of swords?

                                              katsumoto
                                   (subtitled)
                          i read ever y edict with singular attention.

                                            omura
                                  (subtitled)
                          yet you would bring weapons into this chamber?

                                            katsumoto
                                  (subtitled)
                          this chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred
                          years--

                                          omura
                                 (interrupting, subtitled)
                          we need no protection... we are a nation of laws now.

                                             katsumoto
                                    (calm, subtitled) .
                          we are a nation of whores. selling ourselves to our western
                          "allies."

katsumoto slowl y looks around at the members of the council, but his words are addressed
to the emperor.

                                            katsumoto
                                  (subtitled)
                          does japan no longer need its patriots?

omura speaks with quiet conviction and honesty.

                                             omura
                                   (subtitled)
                          who is the patriot? the man who would keep his
                          country trapped in the past, or the man who would help
                          his people into the future?

                                             katsumoto
                                   (subtitled)
                          a future with no honor,

                                             omura
                                   (subtitled)
                          honor means less to me than feeding our children. and
                          teaching them. and giving them modern medicine so
                          they will live.    .

                                                                                     85.

                                            katsumoto
                           and lining your own pockets in the process.

they stare at one another with barely concealed hostility.

                                               omura
                                     (subtitled)
                           minister katsumoto, it is with great regret that i ask
                           you to remove your sword, as this body has declared
                           in its edict.

katsumoto's hand closes on his sword hilt

                                            katsumoto
                           this sword serves the emperor, and only he can
                           command me to remove it.


katsumoto looks to the emperor, as murmurs fill the room.

                                               omura
                                    (quickly)
                           ah, but it is our tradition that the emperor's voice is
                           too pure and great to be heard in such worldly
                           circumstance as the council of state.

one last time, katsumoto meets the emperor's eye.

                                             katsumoto
                           then, with great regret, i must refuse to give up my
                           sword.

omura looks to his associates, and a silent decision is made.

                                             omura
                           minister katsumoto, i must invite you to
                           accompany our soldiers to himeji castle, where
                           you will be our honored guest. i think you will
                           find the surroundings there quite harmonious.

guards with mauser rifles move into position around katsumoto. he turns to
the other council members. looks at them.

                                              ka tsumoto
                                    (subtitled)
                           brothers ... one day you will know what you have done
                           and feel what i never will ... shame.

omura nods to the guards. the guards lead katsumoto out.

                                                                                                  86.
