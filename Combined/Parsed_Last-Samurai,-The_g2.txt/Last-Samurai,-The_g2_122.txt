int.                       rickshaw                     night

algren and bagley, in formal dress uniforms, sit in one of the rickshaws.
bagley looks him over.

                                            bagley
                            oughtta shave more often, algren. becomes you.

                                             algren
                            thought i would follow the japanese fashion.

                                             bagley
                            ...heard you were leaving, actually?

                                            algren
                            why would i do that? omura wants me to train his
                            personal guard.

                                             bagley
                            certainly seems obsessed by you. why do you
                            think that is?

                                                                                               90.
                                           algren
                          could it be my nose isn't permanently lodged up
                          his ass?

bagley shakes his bead, turns away. algren stares up at the looming aide.
