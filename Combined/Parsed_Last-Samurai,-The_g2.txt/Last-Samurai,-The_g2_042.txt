int.                    yoritomo's house                           days later

daylight streams in, finding algren lying on his back. the worst of the detox
is past. as be lies there, these first moments of repose lead to:

a sudden flash of memory:

the beautiful blond woman from the picture laughs merrily, and falls
back languorousl y in a grassy fi eld.

back in the room

algren shakes off the memory as harsh sounds from outside draw him to
the window.                  .
