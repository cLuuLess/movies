int.                      yoritomo's house                               night

algren is asleep. and then we note that the ground is vibrating .. he slides
across his mat .- wakes with a start

an unholy rumbling-

algren bolts up ... just as a paper wall rips open, the wooden framework to the room splits
and the roof collapses--

an earthquake. common for this part of japan.
