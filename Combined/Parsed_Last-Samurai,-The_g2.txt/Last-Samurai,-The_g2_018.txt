                           that young pup runs this country?

                           that "pup" runs the country no more than i do.
                           he was installed as a figurehead at age twelve
                           when the warlords realized japan needed a central
                           government. but don't be fooled -- he may be a
                           powerless god, but to these people he's a god
                           nonetheless.

general yoshitaka appears. he is a seasoned soldier in his 40's. a
decent man. he stops before them, bows quickly.

                                             graham
                           gentlemen, may i present general yoshitaka.
                           he will assist you in training the army.

                           general.

algren offers his hand. general yoshitaka does not take it. he bowl his head and
speaks a few words. graham translates:

                                             yoshitaka/graham
                           he greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if
                           you are ready to meet the imperial army.
