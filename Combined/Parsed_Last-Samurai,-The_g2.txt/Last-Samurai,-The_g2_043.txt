ext.                    yoritomo's house                      morning

algren watches from the window as the samurai train. it is like nothing else
in the world. part sacred ritual, part martial preparation, samurai training
com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole.

finally well enough to walk, algren comes out onto the porch to watch the
spectacle. in front of him, is a kendo (the way of the sword) master
practice with their long and short swords. they have incredible control.

nakao, a mountain of a man, is a karate master. he stands unarmed,
four samurai facing him. they attack with wooden swords. he effortlessly
defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking.

kyudo ("the way of the bow") masters use their bows for target practice.
yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. in the distance, a line of plums.

algren watches. yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open.

and then -- in a stunning blaze of movement -- yoritomo fires the arrows --
one after another, amazingly fast -- cleanly hitting each plum. the final arrow
splits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree.

a wooden sword leans against the porch.

algren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. in a flash, uji o has raced over and
grabbed it from him. algren stands motionless as ujio screams at him.

                                                                                  41.


the training stops, as everyone watches uji o berate algren.

even as ujio continues screaming. algren simply shakes his head, turns
awa y, and walk back into the house.
