int.            yoritomo's house                          night

algren now kneels at the table with the rest of the family as they eat. he is
in considerable pain from the rigors of training. he tries to roll the stiffness
out of his neck, when be notices that higen it imitating him. toshiie laughs.

                                                                                                     49.
                                               algren (v.o.)
                            they seem to value nothing more than their
                            families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded
                            men without a shade of remorse..

yoritomo sternly tells higen not to make fun of their guest. yoritomo
apologizes to algren, who shakes his head unnecessary.

                                               algren
.                           raisu? [rice?]

they stop, shocked. he has spoken!

yoritomo calls for taka to serve him more rice, then begins yammering
enthusiastically in japanese. algren holds up his hand.

                                              algren
                            not so fast ko...toba? [words?]
                                     (bolds up chopsticks)
                            what is this?

                                               yoritomo
                            hashi.

                                               algren
                            hashi.

yoritomo is hysterical with glee now.

                                               yoritomo
                            hail!

the boys are suddenly dervishes, pulling various objects from the table and around the room, shouting the
japanese words for each.

algren shakes his head, and smiles for the first time in this stor y.

yoritomo manages to quiet the boys. he points to himself.

                                               yoritomo
                            yoritomo.

                                                algren
                                      (points to himself)
                            algren.

                                               yoritomo
                            all-gren.
algren nods, and the boys start screaming "all-gren!"

                                              yoritomo
                                    (points to each in rum)
                            higen. toshiie. taka.

                                                                               50.

                                            algren
                                  (bowing)
                          higen. toshiie.
                                  (turns to taka)
                          taka.
she meets his eyes for the slightest moment, then looks down and walks away.
