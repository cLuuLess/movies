int.                    yoritomo's house                      night

algren wakes again. he is lying on a simple mat. his injuries are such that
he can barely move his head. he takes in the traditional japanese furnishings.

a red ball rolls across the floor. and after it... toshiie, a little boy. around
four. the boy l ooks at algren. offers him the ball. smiles.


a1gren blacks out...


int                      yoritomo's house                       another day

algren's eyes open...

through the archway he can see toshiie and his older brother higen, around
ten. also the beautiful woman who earlier was stitching his wound.

from his recumbent position, algren watches as she ministers to the boys,
who are dearly her sons. algren is fascinated by her grace and the sweet
attention she gives them.

she seems to sense him. her eyes raise, meet bit. she speaks to someone,
and yoritomo appears. he is twenty-one, too young to be the woman's
husband. yoritomo comes into algren's room. speaks to him.


algren shakes his head. doesn't understand


yoritomo speaks to the woman, who approaches and places bowl of soup
in front of algren. he ignores it

the boys stand in the doorwa y. yoritomo shoos them awa y.


algren glances up at the: woman. her eyes avoid his, her expression is opaque.
