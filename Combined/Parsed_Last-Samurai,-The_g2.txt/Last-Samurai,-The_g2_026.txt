colonel bagley and algren stand at a map. omura sits.

                                             algren
                           they're not a fighting unit yet

                                               bagley
                           we have no choice.
                                (refers to the map)
                           --the railroad has been stopped here. just as it
                           entered yoshino, katsumoto's province.

                                                                                   28.
                                                  omura
                           captain, we     cannot govern a country in which
                           we cannot tr    avel freel y. ... katsumoto's
                           provocation     is strategic. his defeat will
                           demonstrate     to the other disloyal samurai that
                           resistance is   an act devoid of honor.

                                             bagley
                           the rebels don't have a single rifle. they're
                           savages with bows and arrows. you get up there
                           and show 'em how it', done.

                                              algren
                           with respect, sir, i need more time.

                                             omura
                           with all due respect. this railroad cannot wait.

         he bows and leaves them alone. bagley spins on a1gren.

                                             bagley
                           you think we're the only country interested in
                           japan?! you don't think the germans and the
                           french would like to oversee the new army?

                                                algren
                           colonel--

                                              bagley
                                     (brutally)
                           why do you think we're here, captain? because
                           remington and colt and winchester have
                           powerful allies in washington. we're here to
                           sell a shitload of american guns...and steel...and
                           timber. that shouldn't be bud for a winchester
                           whore like you to understand.

algren looks at him, murderously.

                                                algren
                           yes, air.
