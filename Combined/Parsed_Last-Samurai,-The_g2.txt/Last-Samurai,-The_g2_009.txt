int.                ship -- algren's berth                      night

algren lies in his cramped berth. can't sleep.

a sudden flash:

on the wagon of dead bodies, algren's eyes open to stare into the unblinking
eyes of his brother, davey, half his face shot off. he tries to move but be is
buried beneath the weight of those piled on top of him. blood drips down
into his eyes and mouth, blinding and choking him.

back to the ship:

algren awakens, bathed in sweat. terror. a silhouette in the doorwa y.

                                                                                 13.
colonel bagley stands looking down at him.

                                                bagley
                            i hope you realize the kind of second chance
                            this is for you. i won't tolerate insubordination.

algren reaches for a nearby glass, drains it.
                                                algren
                            court-martial me.

                                              bagley
                            would you rather i hadn't recommended you
                            for the medal. nathan? is that it?

                                             algren
                            we both know why you helped me, colonel.
                            don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.

                                              bagley
                            i expect you to do your job. save the self-pity
                            for your own time.

he turns and walks out, leaving algren to stare at the empty glass.
