int.              katsumoto's house                            night

katsumoto is arranging flowers. algren watches in confusion, as this
powerful lord goes about doing something so feminine and delicate. finally:

                                           katsumoto
                          the parliament of your country has two houses.
                          why is that?

                                           algren
                          to keep either one from being too powerful.

                                           katsumoto
                          does not a people need a powerful ruler to
                          protect them?

                                           algren
                          we believe the opposite.

katsumoto thinks about this.

                                             algren
                          i have a question. how do you come to speak
                          english?

                                               katsumoto
                          members of the council were required to study
............              it. ........yes, i was a member of the government.
                          i helped restore the emperor to the throne.

                                            algren
                          so that japan could have a powerful ruler to
                          protect it.

katsumoto understands algren's irony, but doesn't smile.


                                         algren
                          and now you must hate him for what he's done.

                                            katsumoto
                          he is my blood. i serve him with my life.

                                            algren
                          by fighting his army?

katsumoto looks at a1gren.

                                                                                                             51.

                                              katsumoto
                           i do not fight the emperor. i fight those who
                           seek to influence him, those who betray the soul
                           of my country.

he slowl y draws his long samurai sword, and places it next to the flowers on the table in front of him.

                                              ka tsumoto
                           the emperor gave this blade to my ancestors
                           400 years ago. it has been used only to defend his
                           sacred honor.

katsumoto hands the sword to algren. algren studies it.

                                             katsmuoto
                           it takes many years to make a sword. it is a holy
                           act. a samurai's sword is his soul.

                                             algren
                           this sword is flawed. what is this uneven line
                           near the edge?

katsumoto smiles at algren's ignorance.

                                              katsumoto
                           one man is flexible and compromises too much
                           to avoid conflict. another man is so fierce he
                           wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know
                           peace. a man who knows both is the perfect
                           warrior. the lame is true of a blade .. one steel
                           bends, and the other cuts. and where they
                           meet is never perfect hold the blade up. .

algren holds the sword, cutting edge up. katsumoto takes a silk cloth and drops it. it gently billows down -- and
splits evenly on the edge.

                                            katsumoto
                           some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the
                           blood of its enemy.

algren hands the sword back. suddenly, katsumoto swings the sword, cleanly splitting the table in two.
silence.

                                           algren
                           the crew at winchester can produce one rifle ever y
                           seven minutes.

                                            ka tsumoto
                           we gave up firearms two hundred years ago. it
                           takes no courage to kill. a man from half a mile
                           awa y. you must look into the eyes of your enemy
                           to know who you have killed.

                                                                                                       52.
                                             algren
                          i'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.

                                             katsumoto
                          do you?

                                              algren
                          i think all killing's a filthy business.

                                              katsumo
                          to taking a man's life is
                          nothing. it is his honor you
                          can never take awa y.

                                           algren
                          in other words you have no respect for human life.

                                              ka tsumoto
                                   (fierce) .
                          what do you know of human life? you come here to kill for
                          money where is your family? where is your wife, your sons?
                          what is your legacy?

                                             algren
                                   (undaunted)
                          and what is yours? to rebel against the future? i fought the
                          south in our civil war. their leaders believed they were fighting
                          for "honor" just as you do. and their people died by the thousands!

katsumoto simply looks at him.

                                           algren
                          and my wife is dead.

                                             katsumoto
                          mine, too.


they look at each other. some unexpected recognition has taken place.

                                            katsumoto
                          tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for
                          dominance in the..."far east."

                                             algren
                          ...i look forward to it.


algren turns to go.
