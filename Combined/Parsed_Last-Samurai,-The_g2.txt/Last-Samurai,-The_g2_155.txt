ext.                      village                       night
it is the eve of battle. and the samurai rejoice.

katsumoto is on stage at the center of the village square, enthusiastically
performing a noh drama. algren sits with toshiie and taka in the audience,
enjoying katsumoto's theatrics.

other samurai can be seen around the village, eating, singing, and playing
instruments. tonight is for celebrating life.

elsewhere, a flash as graham takes a photograph of some children.

                                                                                            103.
on the stage, katsumoto spots algren in the audience, points to him and
encourages him to join him. algren resists. toshiie prods him. algren
surrenders and joins katsumoto on the stage. the villagers are delighted.

katsumoto embroils algren in the performance. algren does his best,
laughing at katsumoto's antics.

it is the freest and happiest we have ever seen algren. time
slows as we savor his simple enjoyment

toshiie is highly amused. taka has a deeper response, she is moved as she
watches algren give himself over to the part.
