sergeant gant gazes unhappily at his dinner: glistening raw fish; tepid
beancurds; boiled rice. algren, gant, graham, and general yoshitaka sit
cross-legged on the floor. gant finds this extremely uncomfortable.

                                              graham
                           ... before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate
                           himself in the presence of a samurai.

                                             algren
                           what edicts are those?

                                            graham
                           the council of state has been passing a series
                           of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.


                                              gant
                           why?

                                                                               23.

                                             graham
                           because you are here now, sergeant... for the
                           last 800 years guarding japan and fighting her
                           wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai.

the next course arrives. thick, black eel. gant groans.

                                              graham
                           men like mori katsumoto were the most elite
                           caste in japanese societ y until the council of
                           state -- led by your friend omura - decided the
                           whole class had to go ...
                                     (munching eel)
                           ... most of the samurai accepted the new laws.
                           but some didn't. or couldn't. like katsumoto.

general yoshitaka speaks up. graham translates:

                                             graham
                           general yoshitaka bids you to remember that
                           the word samurai means "one who serves." their
                           whole existence is based on serving their
                           country as warriors.

graham finishes translating, then continues on his own:

                                              graham .
                           your imperial army is taking awa y their only
                           reason for being ... so what are they to do now?

algren considers this as he pours another cup of sake.
                 .
                                             algren
                           this is sake?

                                              graham
                           sake. rice wine.

                                              yoshitaka
                           hie! sake.

                                              algren
                           sake..
                                    (to yoshitaka)
                           good.

yoshitaka nods. enthusiastically tries an english word.

                                              yoshitaka
                           good!

                                                                               24.
                                              graham
                           vexing people, the samurai. blood-thirsty,
                           honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. wanted to
                           write a book about them for years, but no
                           westerner can get close enough.

                                            algren
                           ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle.

graham looks at a1gren.

                                               graham
                           he is samurai.


algren looks at yoshitaka with new eyes.
