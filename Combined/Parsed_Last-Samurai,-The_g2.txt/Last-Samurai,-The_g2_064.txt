ext.                       village                               day

algren watches the villagers rebuild. yoritomo and higen strugg1e with a large
wooden framework.

                                                   algren (v.o.)
                            i am str    uck by these people and their acceptance of fate
                            in a1l it   s variations. at a time like this, they seem utterly
                            without      sentiment. even the children have a gravity
                            beyond      their years.

algren goes to them. silently begins to help them.
