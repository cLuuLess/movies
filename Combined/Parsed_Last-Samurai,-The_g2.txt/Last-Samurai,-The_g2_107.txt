int.             omura's office                            day

omura stands like an industrial titan before large picture windows offering a dramatic view of tokyo.
the only decoration in the room is an enormous caravaggio.

                                             omura
                           please, sit down, gentlemen.

omura removes a gold cigarette case and lights up. cigarettes are the newest western fad
sweeping japan.

                                               omura
                                     (re: cigarette case)
                           a gift from czar alexander... captain algren,. it seems
                           you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.

                                             algren
                           yes, sir.

                                             omura
                           he's an extraordinary man, isn't he?

                                             algren
                           he is samurai.

omura gazes at him. slowl y takes i puff from his cigarette.

                                             ambassador swanbeck
                           mr. omura, my people have been drawing up the documents
                           we discussed. i have a draft--

                                             omura
                           we're not quite ready to announce the treaty, ambassador.

                                             ambassador swanbeck
                           excuse me?

                                              omura
                           the emperor is...sentimental. katsumoto was his old mentor--
                           he is not eager to offend him. it will take i few more days.

                                                                                      77.
                                         ambassj\dor sw anbeck
                         how many da ys is " a few?"

                                           omura
                         i assure you the samurai will not stand in the
                         wa y of our agreement. you are prepared to make deliver y?

                                        ambassador swanbeck
                         soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.

                                           omura
                         captain algren you are the expert. will this array of
                         ordnance be sufficient?

                                         algren
                         depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

                                          omura
                         i want my country to take its place as a modern power.

                                           algren
                         then they will set you well on your way.

                                           omura
                         i am pleased.



                                          amdassador sw anbeck
                         mr. omura, you assured us you had the influence
                         with your emperor to make this deal come to
                         pass. with all due respect perhaps there is someone
                         else we should be speaking to.

                                           omura
                         with all due respect, ambassador, perhaps there is
                         someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the
                         french. or the english. or any of the legations waiting
                         in the next room.

ambassador swan beck stands swallowing his rage.

                                          ambassador swanbeck
                         yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.

                                          omura
                         good afternoon, gentlemen.

they start to go.

                                          omura
                         captain algren, perhaps you can stay a moment
                         and tell me of your experiences in our rebellious
                         provinces.

bagley looks at algren. do as he asks. he leaves a1gren alone with omura.

                                                                                       78.

                                            omura
                          cigarette?

                                            algren
                          thank you.


omura lights his cigarette. a moment as he takes algren's measure.

                                             omura
                          you fought bravely on behalf of our army--
                          against the rebel katsumoto.

algren says nothing.                            .

                                           omura
                          and yet you helped save his life when attacked
                          by the ninja.

                                         algren
                          my role was much less significant than you may have heard.

                                           omura
                          tell me about your role in katsumoto's plans.

                                            algren
                          i have none.

                                         omura
                          and your sympathies?

                                            algren
                          again, i have none.


                                           omura
                          i know you have little sympathy for colonel bagley.

                                           algren
                          he is.... unsympathetic.

omura smiles.

                                            omura
                          i thought it was we who are inscrutable.

now it is algren who smiles.

                                           omura
                          you have gained important knowledge of katsumoto's
                          province, his army, and his rebellion. this is extremely
                          valuable to me.

he watches algren to see how this lands.

                                                                                           79.

                                            omura
                           you also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my
                           weaponry, and my plans. this is extremely va1uable to
                           katsumoto.

                                             algren
                           again, you flatter me.

                                               omura
                           no. i am a businessman. i recognize what is valuable.
                           and i buy it.
                                     (looks at him)
                           in this case, i value your loyalt y.

algren considers the implications of what omura is saying.

                                             algren
                           i didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.

                                             omura
                           then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future
                           friendship - for which, as a friend, i would be in your debt.

                                             algren
                                   (stands)
                           then i will consider it.

                                             omura
                           and i will be grateful.
