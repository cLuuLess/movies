int.                   inn-- katsumoto's room                          night

the blazing sword battle continues.

algren throws a beautiful painted standing-screen in front of an attacking ninja,
momentarily confusing him. then he stabs through the screen -as a blood-
stain spreads across the pastoral painting.

but another ninja catches algren off-guard and slices at him with his short sword. as
algren lifts his sword to parry the blow, his litile finger is chopped off.

he drops the sword, momentarily defenseless.

across the hallway

yoritomo has been watching the shadowpla y on the rice-paper walls.
algren's attacker raises his blade to deliver the death blow.

in katsumoto's room

algren flinches involuntarily beneath the raised blade. suddenly the ninja jackknifes
as if punched by an unseen hand. as he spins, dead, to the ground, we see an arrow
lodged bet ween his shoulder blades. yoritomo has fired blindly, through the wall Â­
killing algren's attacker.

nearby, a ninja hurls a throwing star at katsumoto. with blind instinct katsumoto
turns and takes the blade in the meat of his arm.

algren, meanwhile, has ripped the sleeve of his kimono into a tourniquet for his maimed hand.
he uses the rest of the fabric to tie his hand to his sword before launching himself
back into the fray -- slicing an attacker just as he is about to impale katsumoto.

together, he and katsumoto force the last two ninjas through a paper wall to the next room.
they fight all the wa y through that room and blast through another paper wall to the next.

                                                                                                    70.
