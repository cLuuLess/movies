algren stands across from ujio, ready again for the ken-jutso.

they stand frozen for a long time, hands on the hilts of their wooden swords.
other samurai watch.

algren and ujio stare at each other.

but there is something different about algren's expression. not as much
fury and competition, more a sense of balance and alertness. he studies ujio's eyes, his hands,
the folds of his kimono, the attitude of his body.

we watch a1gren closel y.

gradually all sound drains away. we hear only algren's steady breathing. he is
aware of everything. a bird in a tree. a woman grinding rice. a plum about to fall.
a gently swa ying battle flag,

slow-motion as:

algren attacks -- no fury, just control-- ujio tries to deflect the blow, algren
anticipates - he swings his sword elegantly - -ujio blocks it -- algren counters --

algren presses forward, his sword slashing masterfully, forcing ujio back
ujio counters with complex moves as he retreats --algren keeps moving
forward, calm -- finally ujio's sword is swept aside in one clean
movement. algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword it ujio's throat.

the other samurai watch. amazed.

algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry "fl ourish." the pride he has alwa ys taken in his
swordsmanship has been restored. he bows to uji o.

ujio nods his head, slightly, in respect


the other samurai, led by the hearty nakao, congratulate algren.
