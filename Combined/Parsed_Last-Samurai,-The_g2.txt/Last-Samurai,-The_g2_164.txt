ext.                  barricades                          day

algren and katsumoto wait behind the second barricade. we note that this
barricade is the real thing.

katsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm, a
bullet wound beneath. algren looks over the barricade.

they see imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders
on the opposing hilltop.

                                                katsumoto
                             how long?

                                                algren
                             they need to regroup and report our position. then
                             they'll come hard.

katsumoto considers the bodies of the dead imperia1soldiers.

                                                 ka tsumoto
                             it is sad to see brave men die without faces... you cannot
                             tell one warrior from another.

                                               algren
                             they're not warriors. they're soldiers. it's a
                             modern army.

                                             katsumoto
                             not my world anymore.
