                                                   katsumoto

                                                   algren
                             just -- stay there.

                                                   katsumoto
                             help me up.

algren helps him to stand. without algren's support, he would fall.

                                                   katsumoto
                             my sword...

                                                   algren
                             no.

                                              ka tsumoto
                             you have your honor again. let me die with
                             mine ... kaishaku.

algren looks at him, deeply moved. katsumoto manages to pull out his short sword.

                                             katsumoto
                             you must help me. hold it firmly...

algren supports katsumoto as he holds the sword's point firmly to his stomach.

                                                   ka tsumoto
                             are you ready?

                                                   algren
                             no, kaishaku.

                                                                                     116.
 katsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly.

                                                 katsumoto
                               we will ride together again.

katsumoto embraces algren firmly -- the sma1l sword impales him

algren holds him tightly. katsumoto is looking over algren's shoulder as he dies.

katsumoto sees something. a look of joy and absolute peace comes to his features.

                                                   katsumoto
                                         (whispers)
                               it is perfect... they are all perfect.

his eyes cl ose. he is dead.

algren gently kneels with katsumoto's body

he holds him for a moment and then turns to see what katsumoto was looking at.

cherry blossoms.


a display of perfect beauty.


we slowl y fade to...
