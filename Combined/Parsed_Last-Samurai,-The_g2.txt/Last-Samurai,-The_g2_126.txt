int.                           castle Â­ corridor                          night

the servant leads algren through a corridor, head bowed.

then, stil1 puffing on his cigar, algren taps the servant on the back, and as
the man turns, decks him. the servant falls.

algren flicks hit cigar out onto the sloping roof. we follow the
burning ember as it rolls off the roof and lands at the feet of two
curious guards.
