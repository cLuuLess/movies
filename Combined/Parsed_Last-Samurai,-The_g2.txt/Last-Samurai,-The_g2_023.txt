int.                 geisha house                    night

this is certainly not the whorehouse they expected. elegant japanese
furnishings. lovel y flute music. the madam lowers her head and speaks
quietly in greeting.

                                            gant
                           my friend and i were looking for some
                           companionship...

the madam speaks no english. gant speaks louder, as if to a deaf person.


                                             gant
                           ladies of the evening? hootchie-contchie?
                           boom-boom?

                                            algren
                                    ( embarrassed)
                           zeb.
                                     (tries a bow to the madam)
                           ...so sorry.

gant flashes a fistful of japanese currency.

                                            gant
                           universal language. boyo.

the madam nods and bows. almost magically, two beautifully-dressed
geishas appear, their faces are painted pure white.

                                                                                     25.
one of the geishas smile. her teeth are blackened, to better set off the
whiteness of her face paint

                                                gant
                            that one's yours.
