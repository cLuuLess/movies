int.                 yoritomo's house                                    days later

algren works with yoritomo, binding the wooden framework. higen prepares
the paper walls nearby. he does this with considerable skill.

taka is getting water from a rain barrel she observes algren helping
rebuild her home. yoritomo is working nearby.
algren's japanese is rough but improving:

                                             algren
                                    (in japanese, subtitles)
                            would last longer ... if stone.

                                             yoritomo
                                   (subtitles)
                            no. house fall. house go back easy with wood.

algren shakes his head. taka appears with cups of water. algren looks at her
for the first rime, she holds his gaze.
