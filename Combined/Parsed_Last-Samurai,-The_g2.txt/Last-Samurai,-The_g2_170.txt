ext.             opposing hilltop                           sunset

a japanese officer shouts out an order -- the gatling guns stop.

omura screams at him to continue firing!

the japanese officer barks out response. refusing.

omura sees all the samurai are dead or dying.

but he also sees algren kneeling by katsumoto, dragging him awa y. he
screams at the japanese officer to resume fire!

the japanese officer refuses.

he just looks over the plain of dying samurai for a moment. then he does
the most remarkable thing.

he slowl y kneels and touches his head to the dirt.

                                                                                    115.
then a soldier near him does the same thing. then another and another.
and then by the thousands.

they kneel and touch their heads to the dirt.

honoring the last samurai.
