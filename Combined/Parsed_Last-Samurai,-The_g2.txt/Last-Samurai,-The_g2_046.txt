ext.               village                            night

a first, light snowfall has covered the ground. a1gren walks out into the still
night. he turns a corner and confronts curious sight:

ten warriors kneel, motionless in the snow, their eyes closed in concentration.

as algren puzzles over this, he becomes aware that katsumoto is now
standing next to him.

                                                   katsumoto
                              they are training.

                                                   algren
                              training what?

                                                 katsumoto
                              their minds. it is called bushido...

                                                                                   42.

algren looks at him. he has never heard the word.


                                           katsumoto
                       the wa y of the warrior. we study from when
                       we are young. are my words correct?

algren does not respond.

                                              katsumoto
                            i will practice my eng1ish with you.

                                            algren
                            why do you learn english?

                                            katsumoto
                            to know m y enemy.

                                             algren
                            if i am your enemy, why have you not killed
                            me?

katsumoto doesn't answer.

                                           algren
                            was general yoshitaka your enemy?

                                             katsumoto
                            no, i honor his memory as my kinsman.

                                            algren
                            that why you helped him kill himself?

                                                katsumoto
                            if a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take
                            his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture.
                            it is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend,
                            help him. i was honored to by his kaishaku.

                                                algren
                            hell of an honor.

                                               katsumoto
                            it was his destiny. he knew it, he died at peace.

                                            algren
                            who was the warrior in the red armor?

                                            katsumoto
                            my son-in-law. his name was hiroshi.

                                           algren
                            and the woman who cares for me?

                                                                               43.
                                           katsumoto
                           my daughter, hiroshi's wife. her name is taka.

         algren is incredulous.

                                             algren
                           i killed her husband?

                                            katsumoto
                           it was an honorable death.

katsumoto walks awa y.
