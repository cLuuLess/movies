                           who is this?

                                          algren
                           name's simon graham. wants to write a book
                           about you.

                                                                                   93.

                                                graham
                           an honor. i have followed your activities with
                           great interest. i think the european public
                           would be fascinated by a book about your
                           adventures.

                           not a book. a play!

suddenly, from below, the raised voices of guards. they hurry a wa y.
