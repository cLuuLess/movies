the training continues. we see gant, now sporting a black eye. algren
walks with general yoshitaka and graham. graham translates:

                                           yoshitaka/ graham
                           the general wishes to know if you bad a pleasant
                           evening?

algren looks at yoshitaka, who gives him. wry look..

                                              algren
                           it was... educational
                                     (yoshitaka nods)
                           would the general mind telling me more about
                           our common enemy?

yoshitaka looks at him. has algren deliberately used the word, "enemy,"
knowing that yoshitaka, too, is a samurai? algren gives nothing awa y.

                                              yoshitaka/graham
                           ... mori katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader.
                           to those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. his
                           force is estimated at about five hundred and growing
                           by the day. all samurai.

                                           algren
                           what kind of man is be?

graham translates. general yoshitaka considers his words.

                                                                              27.

                                              yoshitaka/graham
                           katsumoto has no fear. he has no pity. he is
                           kotsutai-- the soul of old japan ... he is my
                           honored kinsman.

                                             algren
                           kinsman?

                                             yoshitaka/graham
                           we grew up together in yoshino. marched
                           together and fought together. he is kaishaku
                           the brother of my spirit.

algren considers this as they observe rifle practice. erratic but
improving. algren notes yoshitaka's reaction. the rifles seem to make
him unhappy.

                                           algren
                           ask him what kind of guns katsumoto has.


                                            graham
                           the samurai don't use guns.

                                            algren
                           no, ask him what kind of firearms they have.

graham obliges. yoshitaka responds, with disdain:

                                            yoshitaka/graham
                           the samurai no longer dishonor themselves by
                           touching firearms.

algren is surprised at this bit of information. a servant approaches, bows.

                                            graham
                           colonel bagley requires you.
