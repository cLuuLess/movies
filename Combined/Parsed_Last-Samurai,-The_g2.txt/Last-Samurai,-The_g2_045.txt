int.                small room                           day


algren opens a sliding shojii screen and discovers a small room that has been
made into a kind of shrine.

cand1es and incense burn, a small buddha sits on a dais, and algren's eyes
are drawn to what seems like an apparition standing in the corner.

the bright red armor of the warrior algren killed in the fog, is held
upright by an unseen stand. it is almost as if the dead warrior himself is
swing back at him.

algren senses someone behind him and turns. the woman is standing across
the hall. their eyes meet. she turn, and walks away.
