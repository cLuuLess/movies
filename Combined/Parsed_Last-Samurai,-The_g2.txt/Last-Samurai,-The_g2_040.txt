ext.                      village                      day

a glimpse of village life -- fish are hung on lines to dry, children chase each
other, clothes are washed in the river, and in the rice fields below, farmers
squat as they have for thousands of years. in his hut, the swordsmith
continues to hammer and fold the blade.
