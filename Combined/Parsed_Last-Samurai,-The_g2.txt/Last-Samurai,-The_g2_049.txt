int.              yoritomo's house                                   evening

algren lies painfully on a mat, his eyes unfocused.


a sudden flash of memory:

the lovel y blond woman, tears in her eyes, looks up to algren's shining face,
the epaulets on his crisp officer's, uniform gleaming gold in the sun.

the reverie is broken.

as taka kneels to swab the cuts on his face. he stares at her darkly.

                                            algren
                         who are you people anywa y?

she makes no attempt to understand or respond.

                                               algren
                         you have no god, you have no mercy, you don't
                         even have any fucking walls. your walls are
                         made of paper, what's the matter with you?

she pushes his head aside so she can attend to his neck.

                                                 algren
                         this man tries to kill me and i've done nothing
                         to him, and you, i kill your husband and you act
                         like, what? like i'm a guest in your house.
                         what is wrong with you?

this last said so intensely that she glances at him before picking up a bowl
of soup she had brought for him, and bringing it to his lips...

                                               algren
                         do you have a soul at all?

                                                                                  46.

he stares at her for a moment, then knocks the soup out of her blinds.

her eyes flash for one moment, before resuming their usual mildness.
but that flash is enough to satisfy him, and he calms down. she walks away.
he sighs, exhausted, only to see her approach again with a new bowl. their
eyes meet, and hold for a moment. she does have a soul. he takes a sip.
