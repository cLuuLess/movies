int.                upper keep                    night

a narrow ladder leads to the final redoubt. they start to climb but yoritomo
leans against the wall. he is gravely wounded.

                                                algren
                            come on.

                                              yoritomo
                                    (subtitled)
                            you go, algren-san. i will stop them.

                                                                                   95.

                                             algren
                           no--

                                             yoritomo
                           ...please.

yoritomo's determination is absolute. finally, algren nods.

katsumoto moves to yoritomo, leans in for a few final words, taking his
head and pressing his forehead to yoritomo's.

bullets begin ricocheting around them -- yoritomo looks to algren:

                                              yoritomo
                                    (subtitled)
                           tell my family.

algren bows his bead in respect.

then algren leads them up the stairs. ujio fires a final volley, nods with
respect to yoritomo, then follows the others.


yoritomo pulls himself erect. draws his two samurai swords.

a beat. he closes his eyes. smiles.

then he opens his eyes and hurls himself down the stairs--

the guards fire hitting yoritomo - but still he comes -- wading into them
swords flashing -- he is hit again and again -- but still he comes.

it is a glorious death.
