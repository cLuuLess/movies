int.                yoritomo's house                       night

algren sits hunched in a dark corner. his body is convulsed with shivering.
his withdrawal from alcohol, his wounds, his isolation and his imagined sins
are devouring him.                                                                .

then we see he is not alone. the woman stands in the doorway, watching
him closel y. finally she enters with a bowl of soup.

he glances up, something like panic in his eyes.

she kneels and attempts to hand him the soup, but be knocks it out of the
wa y and grabs her by the throat.

                                                                                     40.
                                               algren
                            sake!

she stares at him, the breath being squeezed out of her, but there is not even
a whisper of fear in her eyes. she is utterly impassive. shaken, he lets her
go, and crumples to the floor.                         .

                                             algren
                                      (mumbling to himself)
                            sake...

the woman leaves the soup and wa1ks away.
