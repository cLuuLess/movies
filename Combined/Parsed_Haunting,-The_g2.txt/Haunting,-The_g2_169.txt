     int. second floor hallway - night

     nell leads marrow and theo down the dark hallway, the twisted 
     woodwork along the walls frozen, but seeming poised to reach out, 
     trip someone, grab a sleeve.

     it is a nightmare house.  doing what it was made for.

     the bumping they've left behind seems to vanish up and into the
     ceiling.  it gives chase, on the floor above.  nell keeps looking 
     back, and every time she does the bumping seems to get more firm, 
     more like a footstep.  calm, nell urges them on.

                               nell
                   hurry.

     the footsteps upstairs come faster; whatever's up there moving 
     better, more naturally.

     theo and marrow turn left through an archway.  nell looks back at 
     the ceiling.  the thing's moving fast.

     she dodges toward the archway where theo and marrow went, and stops.
     it's a wall.  solid wall.  there's no archway here!  nell backs 
     away.  alone.

     the house has separated them.

     nell tries to open any of the hall doors, but they are all locked.
     there's no other way then going back.
