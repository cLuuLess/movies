     int. mezzanine - day

     nell is back in the mezzanine, steps carefully over crain's 
     painting.  the long white lace curtains in front of a side window 
     start to flutter in the wind... but the window is closed!

     nell walks up to the top of the stairs, her back to the window, 
     calls out:

                               nell
                   jim!  theo!

     no answer, and as she steps forward, listening for a reply, the
     curtain billows out behind her, and in its movement, becomes for a
     split second, the image of crain, grabbing for her.

     nell, oblivious, steps just out of reach, and as the breeze fails, 
     the contours and patterns of the billowing curtain dissolve into 
     chaos.  nell glances back at it, just sees curtain, and looks up at 
     the open window.

     she turns from it, determined, and starts out to find her friends 
     and walks down the steps.
