     int. nell's bathroom - night

     nell stands in the door to her room.

                               nell
                   good night, theo.

     nell shuts the door.  theo is about to close her door, but 
     hesitates.  she puts on the light and goes to the tub.  she turns it 
     on, waits.  just the sound of the water.  and no bumping.
