     int. grand stairway - day

     luke, nell and marrow mount the stairs, climb up and up.  they find
     theo in the mezzanine staring at the wall at the painting.  she 
     turns and looks at nell strangely.

     nell, confused, turns around.  on the wall and the painting are dark
     stains.  black.  blue.  runny.  almost like something leaking from 
     the roof has run down.

     nell steps back.  the stains are the letters n and o.  pulling back
     farther: the rest of the word eleanor.

                               nell
                   my name.

     she follows the streaking substance up, blinking in rising fear as
     more running letters appear.  the word: welcome.  and higher up, the
     last: home.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   no...

     but the substance doesn't come from the ceiling.

     it is as if the oils on the painting of hugh crain have been boiled 
     by a heat gun and blasted off, running down from there.  hugh's face 
     is gone.  in place of the face, the underlying ivory of the canvas 
     glares out... like a skull.

     nell screams and runs away, the others calling out after her in 
     alarm.  as they vanish around the corner, the camera tilts down and 
     we discover smeared paint on the floor.  smeared, it seems, with 
     little footprints in it.
