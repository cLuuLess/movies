     int. nell's room - night

     nell lies asleep, the ornate headboard looming behind her, black 
     with its strange plant-like splay of leaves.

     nell draws a deep, sleeping breath... and her eyes open.  she lies
     there, her breath still in her lungs, not moving, but sensing
     something.  a long beat.  when she lets her breath out, we can see 
     it in the cold.
