     int. 2nd floor hallway, north wing - night

     marrow, luke and theo pause at the top of the stairs and peer down
     both long, empty directions of the hallway.

     then marrow turns toward nell and theo's room.  the brass 
     candelabra... in front of the open door.

     the rooms draw nearer, closer.  not even the sound of their 
     breathing.

     the door is ajar.  marrow pushes it open with the tire iron.  the 
     room lies in silent disarray.  normal disarray.  the bed normal.  
     the ceiling normal.  no nell.

     marrow and theo react and enter the room.  luke lingers out in the 
     hall a moment.  and just as he steps in after them we hold on the 
     long, empty hall --

     -- and a figure glides across.  far down at the other end.  she
     disappears.  it was nell.
