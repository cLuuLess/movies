     int. psych observation lab - day

     the lab feels more like the video center of a security office than 
     a psychologist's laboratory.  two banks of black and white monitors 
     give us images of men and women, different ages, different races, 
     wired to electrodes.  they are taking psychological tests, although 
     we never see the testers.  the subjects are working through 
     variations on object manipulation and pattern recognition tests.  
     there are subtle differences between the two banks of monitors.  on 
     the left, the subjects are all twitching at exactly the same time, 
     on the right, the subjects are also twitching, but in no 
     discernible sequence.  the subjects on the left are better able to 
     concentrate on their tasks.  the subjects on the right keep 
     stopping, and going over what they have done.

     two men, malcolm keogh, in his 50's, is a graying professor, the 
     head of the department; someone we trust.

     he faces professor james marrow.  he is a man whose confidence 
     rests uneasily on his ambition, and in the tension between the two 
     is the power that makes him the teacher students love.  right now, 
     though, he is defending himself before a department review.  this 
     is not a court martial with judges behind a desk, it's more free 
     form.

     the men are having a fight, and they are watched by other 
     professors.

                               malcolm
                   it's still an electric shock!

                               marrow
                   come on malcolm, it's only seven
                   ohms, it's nothing, it's like a
                   joy buzzer!  and it's not about
                   the pain, it's about the
                   interference with concentration...

     malcolm looks at the monitor.  this is marrow's chance to explain 
     it again.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   look, look at what it does!  the 
                   subjects on the left, because they 
                   anticipate the shocks, make the 
                   adjustment, and lose nothing on 
                   their scores.  the subjects on the 
                   right, because the shocks are 
                   random, can't anticipate, and the 
                   distraction throws them off.

                               malcolm
                   stop defending your science after 
                   the fact, jim.  the department 
                   protocol for research is very 
                   clear about this, and you violated 
                   the rules.  i know, i know, i know 
                   that "fear and performance" is a 
                   big sexy idea, but as long as i'm 
                   chairman here you will need this 
                   department's endorsement to 
                   publish it, and right now i can't 
                   do that.

     at this moment, mary lambretta, late 20's, marrow's pretty t.a., 
     opens the door with an armload of files.  whatever else she's 
     wearing, she wears glasses.  marrow, seeing her, motions for her to 
     go away.  he doesn't break eye contact with malcolm.  mary 
     hesitates...

                               marrow
                   malcolm, this is essential work 
                   i'm doing.  just think what my 
                   research can do for education.  
                   elementary school classrooms near 
                   train tracks or airports, where 
                   loud noise is random; this helps 
                   to prove the need for sound 
                   insulation if the children are 
                   ever going to learn to read.

                               malcolm
                   and that will be a good place to 
                   end this study.

                               marrow
                   no, malcolm!  individual 
                   performance is only part of it.  i 
                   know why baseball players choke 
                   for no reason, i know why 
                   violinists throw up with fear 
                   before every concert, and need to, 
                   to give a great performance, but 
                   what i want to know is, how fear 
                   works in a group...

                               malcolm
                   not the way you've constructed 
                   your group, it's just not ethical!

                               marrow
                   but if the group knows it's being 
                   studied as a group, you 
                   contaminate the results.  the 
                   deception is minor.

     malcolm sees mary lambretta.

                               malcolm
                   are you working with her?

                               marrow
                   mary, i'll meet you outside.

     she understands, and she closes the door.

                               malcolm
                   why are you working with her?  
                   mary lambretta was thrown out of 
                   the department for trying to get a 
                   ph.d. in psychic studies.

                               marrow
                   and after she was thrown out, she 
                   needed a job.

                               malcolm
                   you don't believe in the 
                   paranormal.

                               marrow
                   no, but she does, and that's all 
                   that matters.

                               malcolm
                   does she know that's why you're 
                   using her?

                               marrow
                   no.

                               malcolm
                   i, i just can't...

                               marrow
                   she needed a job, malcolm.  and 
                   she's smart.  and she helps me.

                               malcolm
                   i have a bad feeling about what 
                   you're doing.

                               marrow
                   this is the last chapter.  please, 
                   please give me clearance.  it's 
                   for science.

     marrow waits.

                               malcolm
                   i'm gonna hate myself for this.

     but he nods.  permission granted.

                               marrow
                   thank you.
