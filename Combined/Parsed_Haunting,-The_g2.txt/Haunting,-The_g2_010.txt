     int. hallway outside lab - day

     they open the door.  they walk out.  mary is there.  she closes her 
     eyes, and does a gypsy voice.

                               mary
                   i see a hostile man... he's (she 
                   describes him).  the hostile man 
                   does not believe in madame velka.

     this relieves the pressure.  malcolm is not listening anymore and
     storms off.

                               mary
                   you know what he's really upset 
                   about?

                               marrow
                   what?

                               mary
                   you're going to publish, he's 
                   going to perish... and why did you 
                   hire me for this?

     marrow has a sly smile.  they go into his office through another 
     door in the lab.
