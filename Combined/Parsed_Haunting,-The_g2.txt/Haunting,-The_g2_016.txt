     ext. gas station - day

     nell is pumping gas at a country station.  she is alone at the 
     pump.  as she finishes, she hears a baby crying.  she looks up.  
     she is immediately drawn by the sound.

     she moves to a car at another pump.  the car is empty.  the windows 
     are rolled up.  she peers into the car, through the window, and 
     sees a toddler in a car seat.  the child is crying.  nell looks 
     around, no one is there.  she makes faces at the baby, coos to it.

                               nell
                   hello baby...

     she does a peek-a-boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby 
     even starts to giggle.

     a voice from behind.

                               mother (o.s.)
                   what's going on, what happened?

     nell turns.  the mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with 
     stuff from the gas station's market.

                               nell
                   she's okay.  she woke up and she 
                   saw she was alone.

     the mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.

                               mother
                   say thank you, spencer.
                          (too much of an
                           explanation)
                   i was getting her something to 
                   drink.  she's been crying all 
                   day...

                               nell
                   that's all right.

                               mother
                   of course you know, how many 
                   children do you have?

                               nell
                   none.

                               mom
                   then you're a teacher.  nursery 
                   school.

                               nell
                   no.

                               mom
                   you just... you seem like someone 
                   who takes care of children, lots 
                   of children.

                               nell
                   maybe... maybe someday.  i'd like 
                   that.

     the woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car.  
     when she does, we see a friendly gas station attendant appear 
     behind nell.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   umm, i'm a little lost.

                               gas station attendant
                   where you going?

     nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.

                               nell
                   they sent me directions and i've 
                   got a map, but it's kind of 
                   confusing.  here... it's a place 
                   called hill house?

     his helpful attitude changes dramatically.

                               gas station attendant
                   hill house.

     he takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.

                               nell
                   what are you doing?

                               gas station attendant
                   you don't want to go there.

     he turns abruptly and walks away.

                               nell
                   did i say something wrong to you?

     nell slams the buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine.  
     she gets control, and puts the car in gear.  she's shaken.  badly.
