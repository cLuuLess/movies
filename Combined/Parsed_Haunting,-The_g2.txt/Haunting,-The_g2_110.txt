     int. great hall - day

     nell bursts into the great hall and stops.  at the far end of the 
     room broods the vast fireplace, its chain curtains hanging like the 
     veil to some hellish sanctuary.

     nell stares at it, daunted.  what is it that carolyn is trying to 
     show her?  the fireplace beckons, and nell approaches against her 
     will.

     she finds a steel poker hanging by the fireplace, and takes it down.
     she uses it to slide one of the chain curtains open.  she steps into
     its soot-black mouth.

     nell peers up the chimney.  a faint sigh of air.  she sticks the 
     poker up the flue, scratches around.  nothing.

     she turns her attention to the back of the fireplace, thwocks it.
     sooty stone chips away, but it's solid.

     the mechanism for the ash drop catches her eye.  nell grabs the 
     heavy, iron lever.  she pulls, but can barely budge it.  it finally 
     screeches back, and the iron door in the floor of the fireplace 
     swings down.

     nell looks in.  two feet down it looks like a gray blanket of ash, a
     charred timber or two sticking out.  sick with fear, nell prods the
     ash.  just charred wood.

     she thrusts the poker down deep.  it vanishes in the ash up to her
     hand.  clack.  she rakes through the ash.  clack.  and then she 
     feels the poker take purchase.  she draws it out, and full of dread 
     turns it to the light...

     impaled on its hooks are two human skulls.

     nell fights back the scream in her throat.  one of the skulls is a
     child's skull, the other an immense skull with brooding brow, 
     forehead crushed.

     nell lets the poker drop.  it bangs off the door, falls in the ash
     drop, its handle hitting a spring.  nell recoils as the trapdoors 
     snap shut like a pair of jaws.
