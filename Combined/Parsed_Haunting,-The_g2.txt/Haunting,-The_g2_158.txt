     int. locked room - nursery - night

     nell stands there in the darkness, sensing the expanse of the room,
     turning... and kicking something on the floor.

     it is a wooden toy train.  then she sees a rocking horse by her 
     feet.  it is a nursery.  turn-of-the-century.

     and as nell's eyes adjust, as she tries to see what else is in here 
     in the dark, she begins to make out white shrouded shapes.

     against the wall.  a bed covered in a sheet.  a table beside it.  a 
     hand bell.  a cane.

     just like nell's sick room at home.  nell realizes it, covers her
     mouth.

     the furniture is in exactly the same position, though the sheets
     covering the pieces are stained, far older.

     and on the wall, something in a frame is covered with a piece of
     sheet.

     nell approaches it in trepidation and removes the cloth.  for a long
     beat, all we see is her face as it goes slack.  understanding.

     the framed thing is a stitchery.  it says: a place for everything,
     everything in its place.

     just like the one at home.
