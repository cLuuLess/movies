     ext. hill house gate - day

     the gate stands immense.  silent.  forbidding.  beyond them a 
     gravel drive curves away through the trees.  nell kills her car, 
     gets out, instructions in hand.  no one in sight.  a long beat.  
     she reaches in and blows the horn.

     the horn shatters the air, rackets off the trees beyond the gate,
     echoing.  silence.

     nell blows the horn a sustained staccato in annoyance.  the echo
     replies in a terrible, deafening battering of sound.  nell covers 
     her ears.  silence once again.

     in a fit of agitation she goes to the padlock and rattles it.  it's
     locked good.  she turns --

     -- and there is a man right behind her.  it is mr. dudley, his hair
     tied back like an ex-hippie.  he stands between nell and her open
     car door, weed spear in hand.  he smiles at her -- rough, dirty,
     massive.

                               mr. dudley
                   what do you want?

                               nell
                   oh!  you scared me.

                               mr. dudley
                   me?  no.  what are you doing here?

                               nell
                   are you mister dudley, the
                   caretaker?

                               mr. dudley
                   yeah, i'm mister dudley, the 
                   caretaker.  what are you doing 
                   here?

                               nell
                   i'm with dr. marrow's group.  i'm 
                   supposed to check in with mrs. 
                   dudley up at the house.  is she 
                   here?

     she hands him the directions.  he glances at them.  she uses the
     distraction to get into her car.

                               mr. dudley
                   maybe she is...
