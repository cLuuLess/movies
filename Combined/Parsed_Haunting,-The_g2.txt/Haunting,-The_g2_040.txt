     int. 2nd floor hallway - dusk

     the long hall is lost in shadow, its long rows of doors waiting in 
     the deadening silence.  a lamp on a pier table casts a small pool of 
     light.  the walls glow in rich tones, the low-relief carvings a 
     worm's-wood of shadow.

     nell runs her hand over a wall panel as theo peeks into a 
     neighboring room.

                               nell
                   so much carving.  it's everywhere.  
                   on everything.

     theo starts down the hall.  nell follows.
