     int. nell's room - night

     bump.  the sound thuds the stillness of the house.  bump.  bump.  
     bump.  deep, hollow, distant like a dream.  nell sits up, still 
     asleep, body moving by reflex.

                               nell
                   coming, mother!

     whump.  the noise jars her consciousness, lighting up her mind, very
     real.  nell remembers where she is.

     bump bang.  it's coming from somewhere far off in the house.  nell
     listens in cold dread.

                               theo (oc)
                   nell!

     nell spins to the bathroom door, goes through --
