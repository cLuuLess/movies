     int. locked room - nursery - night

     they stop there, staring into the shadows.

                               theo
                   nell?

     and there, hunched over something turning a creaking crank of some
     sort, is nell.

                               marrow
                   nell.

     nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to 
     them.  theo steps toward her, afraid for her.

                               theo
                   what'd you come back for, babe?

                               nell
                   just had to be sure.

                               luke
                   come on, jesus!  let's go!

     marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture, stays back himself as 
     theo approaches nell.

                               theo
                   let's go, hon.  don't you want to 
                   go back to your little apartment 
                   where you can hear the buoy out in 
                   the harbor when the wind is just 
                   right?

     nell smiles at theo.  she's holding something.

                               nell
                   oh, theo.  you know i don't have 
                   an apartment.

                               theo
                   then let's go get you one.

     nell's smile softens even more.  her voice is reassuring.

                               nell
                   don't worry about me, theo.  i'm 
                   wanted.  right here.  i'm home.

     a chill of fear cuts through theo as nell looks deep into her eyes.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   after all...
                          (beat)
                   i'm family.

     the thing in nell's hand is a needle, the thing she's been cranking 
     an ancient phonograph.  she lowers the needle to the spinning 
     record.  and her tune, the one she hums all the time, begins to 
     play.

     the others are frozen where they stand.  marrow's mind reels at the
     implications of what he's hearing.

                               marrow
                   no.

                               nell
                   my mother used to hum this to me.  
                   like her mother hummed it to her.  
                   and my great grandmother carolyn 
                   hummed it to her.

     nell turns back.  the others stand there speechless.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   i have to stay.  you better go.  i 
                   could explain it, but you'd never 
                   understand.

     and that, finally, galvanizes the others into action.  marrow sweeps
     past theo, grabs nell hard, and swings her for the door.

                               marrow
                   come on.

                               nell
                   no --

                               theo
                   please, nell, just see us out.

     luke closes in on nell with marrow, and there's nothing she can do 
     but let herself be pulled along.
