     int. greenhouse - day

     marrow lets nell into a long, victorian-era greenhouse.  it's
     overgrown, lush, the leaded-glass panes above stained with years of
     condensation and pollen.  vines and trees climb up the sides.  beds 
     of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick.

     nell leans down to look into a water garden with a statue of a man
     bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been
     drowning.  a sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse.  and a
     cavalcade of water comes out of the statue's mouth surprising nell.
     she lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with marrow.

     nell loves the greenhouse.  it takes her breath away.

                               nell
                   oh... it's so beautiful...

     nell makes her way among the plants.  she looks up at a towering,
     double-helix staircase which rises from the floor to a platform 
     which gives access to the roof.  below the staircase are planters 
     filled with violets.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   violets.  somebody must've died 
                   here.

     and then, out of the corners, comes mister dudley.

                               mr. dudley
                   that's where she hanged herself.

                               nell
                   who?

                               mr. dudley
                   rene crain.  up there.  rope.  
                   ship's hawser.  hard to tie.  
                   don't know how she got it.

                               marrow
                   that's enough, mister dudley.

                               mr. dudley
                   she stepped off the platform.
                          (he looks up, with 
                           a suggestive leer)
                   they had long skirts in those 
                   days.

                               marrow
                   thank you, mister dudley, 
                   please...

                               mr. dudley
                   house is full of stories.  if you 
                   know how to read these things, 
                   it's an open book.  just a 
                   different library than the kind 
                   you're used to.

                               nell
                   why?

                               mr. dudley
                   why'd she kill herself?

                               nell
                   yes.

                               mr. dudley
                          (what other reason 
                           is there?)
                   she was unhappy.

                               nell
                   why?

                               mr. dudley
                   can't say.  haven't been here that 
                   long.
                          (he's off)
                   well, it's labor day, gotta get to 
                   work.

     and off he goes.

                               marrow
                   that's a horrible story.

     nell looks up, and smiles.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   you're smiling.

     marrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in
     hand, lifts it to her face.  while she talks, she walks, and marrow
     follows.

                               nell
                   i was just thinking how happy i am 
                   right now.  all my life, i've been 
                   waiting for an adventure.  and i 
                   thought, oh, i'll never have that, 
                   adventures are for people who 
                   travel long distances, that's for 
                   soldiers, that's for the women 
                   that the bullfighters fall in love 
                   with.  and here i am, and 
                   something is happening to me.  
                   strange noises in the night.  
                   paintings are calling to me.  and 
                   all it cost to get there was five 
                   gallons of gas.  i'm getting my 
                   adventure.

     for the first time since we've seen nell, there is something to her
     which is simply... erotic.  marrow follows her down one of the
     footpaths.  she smiles back at marrow as he trails her.  she reaches 
     a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the
     slightest sway to her gait.  marrow follows her around the corner 
     into the transept.  at the far end the wall is completely overgrown.

     nell looks up through the ceiling at hill house looming grim 
     outside, distorted in the old glass.

                               marrow
                   someone is playing with you.

                               nell
                   why?

                               marrow
                   i don't know.

                               nell
                   it doesn't matter.  even if 
                   they're tormenting me, someone 
                   wants me.  what i do with this is 
                   up to me.  i can be a victim, or i 
                   can be a volunteer.  and i want to 
                   be the volunteer.

     nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, 
     passionate woman.  she walks away, the sway in her gait aching, 
     powerful.  marrow is surprised by what nell just said and stares at 
     her as she comes to the overgrown end.  nell reaches out to the 
     hanging vines, pulls them aside...

     ...and a face stares out.  gastly.  white.  nell takes an 
     involuntary step back, a little gasp.

     the face is marble.  blind eyes stare from stained cheeks.  it is a
     statue of crain.  marrow comes over.

     it's an enormous stone tableaux of hugh surrounded by cherubim.  the
     plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence
     from the greenhouse.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   hugh crain.  can't seem to get 
                   away from him.

     she laughs a little at herself.  marrow joins in.  he helps her pull 
     the plants back to reveal more of it.

     she reaches out, touches the marble cheek.  then daring, grins, and
     begins to hum her tune.

     marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with hugh
     crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing marrow.

                               marrow
                   what is that tune?

                               nell
                   i don't know.  a lullaby i guess.  
                   my mother used to hum it to me.  
                   and her mother before that, and so 
                   on.
                          (to the statue)
                   hugh crain, would you care to 
                   dance?

     she hums another two notes, and bang!  the door behind her slams 
     open in a gust of wind, jolting nell.  she stops and stares.  
     outside the window, through the glass, she sees mr. dudley, staring 
     at her, he's been watching her dance.  the spell is broken.  nell, 
     embarrassed, can't bear to look at him.

     a beat, and then marrow goes over and shuts the door.  when he turns
     back --

     -- nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps
     echoing in the vaulted room.
