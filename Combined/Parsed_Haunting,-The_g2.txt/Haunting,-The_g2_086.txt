     ext. veranda - day

     the red light on marrow's digital voice recorder blinks.  the device 
     is in marrow's jacket pocket, concealed from nell.  they're sitting 
     in adirondack chairs on the long veranda behind the house.  marrow, 
     beside her, observes.

                               marrow
                   what did it smell like?

                               nell
                   it was very specific.

                               marrow
                          (so tell me...)
                   all right...

                               nell
                   in the bathroom in my mother's 
                   room, the toilet was next to an 
                   old wooden table.  it smelled like 
                   that wood.

                               marrow
                   so... smell... is... smell is the 
                   sense that triggers the most 
                   powerful memories.  and a memory 
                   can trigger a smell.

                               nell
                   i wasn't thinking about my 
                   mother's bathroom.

                               marrow
                   what happened after you smelled 
                   it?

                               nell
                   i looked at theo.  she had a look 
                   on her face.

                               marrow
                   like she smelled it too?

                               nell
                   yes.

                               marrow
                   and then what happened?

                               nell
                   i got more scared.

     marrow thinks about this.

                               marrow
                   hmm.

                               nell
                   i'm sorry.  i'm messing up the 
                   study.

                               marrow
                   no you're not.  something moved 
                   you.  you saw something.

     nell looks to him.  he's sincere.  he believes her.

                               nell
                   i don't know.  maybe i...

     "didn't" she almost says.  she struggles, embarrassed.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   i haven't been with people in a 
                   long time.

     marrow settles in his chair, looks out at the forest.

                               marrow
                   i really haven't either.

     nell peers at him, doubtful.  is she being made fun of?

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   i mean, i'm surrounded by people, 
                   day in, dayout.  students, 
                   colleagues.
                          (beat)
                   but most of the time, even when 
                   i'm with them... you know... it's 
                   all about power, there's not much 
                   room for actually getting to know 
                   someone or having someone getting 
                   to know you.

     nell's face flushes with compassion.  with longing.  marrow looks at
     her.  he's vulnerable.  needing.  she doesn't dare hope.  the moment 
     lasts a few heartbeats.

     he looks away.  a flicker of distress crosses nell's face.  and then 
     she realizes marrow is looking at --

     -- luke.

                               luke (cont'd)
                   you have to see something.
