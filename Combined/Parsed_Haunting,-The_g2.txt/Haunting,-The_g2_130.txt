     int. theo's room - night

     marrow and theo stand in the doorway to the shared bathroom watching
     luke finish taping a trash bag over nell's broken window.  nell lies 
     in her bed, asleep or unconscious, it's impossible to say.  luke 
     finishes, comes over.  marrow is hushed, grim, exhausted.

                               theo
                   she needs help.

                               marrow
                   i'll take her with me to the 
                   university tomorrow.  i can't 
                   believe i read the test wrong.  i 
                   didn't see anything that looked 
                   like she was suicidal.

                               luke
                   you used the wrong test.

                               theo
                          (indignant)
                   will the two of you shut up!  god 
                   damn it!  maybe the tests were 
                   right, marrow.  she's sensitive, 
                   she's vulnerable, but i don't 
                   think she's suicidal and i didn't 
                   have to test her.  maybe she 
                   wasn't trying to kill herself.  
                   maybe she was really scared.  
                   maybe she really heard voices.

     marrow looks away, doesn't want to say this.  theo reads the 
     feelings on his face.

                               luke
                   you're not telling us something.

                               marrow
                   watts.  those were his keys nell 
                   found.  his roommate called and 
                   said watts left when he was 
                   supposed to.  i think he's here.

                               theo
                   he's wandering around the house, 
                   and nell heard him.  she thought 
                   it was ghosts.  let's go look for 
                   him again.

                               marrow
                   no.  if he's lost somewhere in the 
                   house... he'll have to stay lost 
                   until tomorrow, until the night is 
                   over.  what we have to do now is 
                   be together, with nell.

     and they go.  three scared people.
