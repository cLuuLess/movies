     int. nell's kitchen - day

     nell sits at her tiny kitchen table, water glass and tylenol in 
     front of her.  the necklace dangles from her fingers.  she stares, 
     mesmerized by it.  then she undoes the hasp.  the clothes line 
     outside batters louder --

     -- and, defiant, nell puts the necklace on.  she closes her eyes.

     silence.  the battering has stopped.  a beat.  and then the phone 
     rings.  nell opens her eyes.  the phone rings.  keeps ringing.  
     nell, feeling the drug, finds her way to the phone and picks up.

                               nell
                   hello?  yes, this is eleanor.
                   -- where?  yes, it's right here.

     nell listens for a long moment.  she picks up the classifieds, 
     flips through.  and there it is:

                         trouble sleeping?
