     int. nell's room - night

     as nell steps out of frame and starts undressing, the camera finds 
     the carved mantle, the densely-packed scene of children at play, 
     their faces frozen in dark wooden smiles, their eyes blind but 
     staring oc where we sense nell changing.

     now in a long tee-shirt, nell crawls up onto the high bed.  its
     headboard is heavy, dark, engraved with fan-like shapes, maybe 
     plants.

     she draws the covers about her and peers up at the ornate headboard.

     something about it bothers nell, but she can't put her finger on it.
     she twists over on her side and turns out the light on the 
     nightstand. for a moment, all there is in the darkness is her 
     breathing --
