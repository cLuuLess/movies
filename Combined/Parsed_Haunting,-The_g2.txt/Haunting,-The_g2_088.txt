     int. red parlor - day

     nell, panic rising in her voice, confronts the others.

                               nell
                   welcome home eleanor.  welcome 
                   home?  i've never been here.  who 
                   did this?

                               luke
                   it's somebody's idea of a joke.

     she looks at all three of them.

                               nell
                   who did this?  why are you doing 
                   this?  i don't know any of you.  
                   you don't know me.  why are you 
                   doing this to me?

     luke shakes his head.  theo starts getting pissed.  marrow stands 
     there, arms folded, observing.

                               luke
                   i didn't do it.

                               theo
                   you could have.

                               luke
                   so could you!  is this some fucked 
                   up idea of art, putting someone 
                   else's name to a painting?

                               theo
                   no.

                               nell
                   theo... did you?

                               theo
                   maybe you did it yourself.

                               nell
                   why?

                               theo
                   i don't know.  you've been alone 
                   for a long time, maybe you want 
                   attention.
                          (pointing to 
                           marrow)
                   maybe he did it...

                               marrow
                   i didn't.  you know that, nell.

     this is horrifying to nell, being doubted and accused of something 
     so ugly if it were true.

                               nell
                   i don't know anything.  whoever 
                   did this, please, just... just say 
                   so... just... please... this is 
                   cruel.  don't be cruel to me.  i 
                   can't stand it.  you don't know 
                   me.

     and she runs out.

     nell grabs for the door to leave.

     she flings open the door.  monstrous arms seem to grab at her.  but 
     it's only a wild-looking coat rack in the hall.
