     int. nell's car - night

     nell sits in the passenger seat of her car, wrapped in her jacket.  
     she stares out at the gate, at luke and theo consulting.  marrow 
     appears in the window.

                               marrow
                   you okay?

     nell nods, but there's something about her not right.

                               nell
                   why did you bring me here?

     marrow shakes his head, doesn't fully understand.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   why did you call me and tell me to 
                   look in the paper for the ad?

                               marrow
                   nell, what are you talking about?  
                   i never called you.

     nell stares, dismayed, but marrow is dead serious.

                               nell
                   but you told me to look in the 
                   paper!  you told me i'd be 
                   perfect!

                               marrow
                   nell, the first time i ever spoke 
                   with you in person was the night 
                   we met here.

                               nell
                   then who called me?

     hill house looms behind her, windows forming eyes, the carport a
     gaping mouth.

     nell's dismay becomes a cold, terrifying understanding, and she 
     turns and stares back up at the house.

     luke comes up with theo on the other side of the car.

                               theo
                   nell --

                               luke
                   -- how much is this car worth?
