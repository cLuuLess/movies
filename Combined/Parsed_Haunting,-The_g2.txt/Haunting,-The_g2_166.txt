     int. vestibule towards great hall - night

                               luke
                   maybe this'll get your attention!

     luke flicks a lighter out of his pocket.

                               marrow
                   luke!

     before anyone can stop him, he lights a towering tapestry on fire.

     he races from one to the next, lighting them.  theo and nell help
     marrow up, back away as luke shoots by.

     all the tapestries are on fire, blazing up like torches.

     at last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the
     center of the room.  they stare at him, appalled, afraid.  knowing 
     he has done something wrong.

     luke stops.  maybe fifteen feet away.  he sees their expressions.

                               luke
                   what?

     nell looks over at the burning tapestries.  heat sears the stone,
     blackens the carved figures in the woodwork.

     the ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room.

                               luke (cont'd)
                   we'll get out after this wing 
                   burns down.  let's go.

     but there's no need.  the tapestries are consuming themselves too 
     fast to ignite the walls or ceiling.  they all realize it.  as the 
     last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is 
     utter silence.
