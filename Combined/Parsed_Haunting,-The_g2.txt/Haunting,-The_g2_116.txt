     int. kitchen - night

     luke eats chips.  marrow stands by the door, arms folded, matter-of-
     fact.

                               marrow
                   i gave my key to the gate to todd, 
                   but the dudleys'll be here in the 
                   morning.

                               luke
                   do we still get paid for the week?

                               marrow
                   you get your money.

     awkward silence.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   where did she come up with it?  
                   how did she put it all together?

                               luke
                   is that the question of compassion 
                   or science?

                               marrow
                   it's a question.

                               luke
                   she got the child labor stuff from 
                   me.

     theo comes in, she heard what they were talking about.

                               theo
                   i... i was playing games with 
                   her... big city games... i was 
                   bad.  and you, doctor morrow, you 
                   broke her heart.

     he knows this.  it tears him apart.

                               marrow
                   is she asleep?

                               theo
                   yes.  but i promised i wouldn't 
                   let her alone the whole night.

     marrow nods, gets his briefcase, exits.
