     int. nell's room - night

     we see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in nell's lap.
     nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee-shirt and undies.  theo 
     looks at the book with her.

                               theo
                   that's so sad.

                               nell
                   there's hundreds of them.  this 
                   must be a record of the children 
                   who died at the mills, like luke 
                   said.

                               theo
                   before he painted your name over 
                   mister crain.

     theo hands her the bottle.  nell takes it, tops off her glass,
     spilling.  her face is red.  she grimaces as she tosses back a big
     swallow.

                               nell
                   you really think it was luke?

     theo takes another swig.  she holds bottles of nail polish up next 
     to nell's bare feet, testing the colors.

                               theo
                   well, it wasn't me.  mister dudley 
                   had to clean it and he knows that 
                   he's in charge of all the messes 
                   so why would he make more work for 
                   himself and...
                          (beat)
                   you said the good doctor was with 
                   you.

                               nell
                          (pondering)
                   i don't know what to think 
                   anymore.

                               theo
                   just think about one thing right 
                   now: what color?

     nell finally puts the book down and takes a drink.

                               nell
                   i've never had a pedicure before.

                               theo
                   well?

                               nell
                   red.
                          (into this now)
                   what else?

     theo smiles and takes nell's foot gently in her hand.  she begins to
     paint her toenails.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   see, isn't this better than a hit 
                   on the head?

     nell looks down her long legs at theo.

                               nell
                   i'm sorry i was mad at you, theo.

                               theo
                   me too.  although i learned one 
                   thing about you, that you don't 
                   know about yourself.  you can be a 
                   pretty decent bitch.

     nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine.

                               nell
                   i'll take that as a compliment.
                          (beat, trying to 
                           sound casual)
                   in the city, what kind of place do 
                   you live in?

                               theo
                   i have a loft.

     nell is thrilled with this.

                               nell
                   a loft.  that's a lot of room for 
                   one person.  probably.  maybe 
                   there's room for...

     theo looks up, understands what she's asking.

                               theo
                   you want to move to new york, you 
                   want to move in with me?

                               nell
                   i don't know, you know...

     nell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand.  
     theo paints nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush 
     strokes in along the skin.  nell, unused to this, gives into the 
     pleasure, and theo sees how easy it is to move nell.

                               theo
                   my place isn't like yours, nell, 
                   it doesn't have a view of sea.  it 
                   doesn't have a view of anything.  
                   what's interesting about the way i 
                   live is what goes on inside the 
                   walls.  living with me... my 
                   boundaries aren't very well 
                   defined, nell.  do you know what i 
                   mean?

                               nell
                   i'm trying.  have you ever kept 
                   something to yourself because you 
                   were afraid it'd ruin things.

     theo looks up at her, unreadable.

                               theo
                   all the time.

     nell lets out a sigh.  gently theo's hand moves down the arch of 
     nell's foot.  caressing.  nell lets her.

     theo finishes nell's last little toe, and then with the brush out of
     paint, runs it gently up the inside of nell's calf.  nell sighs.

     theo lowers her face near nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near,
     red.  she blows.

     nell raises herself up, peers down at theo.  sees the want on her 
     face.  a long beat.

     nell breaks the gaze, looks away.  theo reads nell's look, and 
     releases her foot.  she sits back in the chair.  for a moment nell 
     doesn't know what to do.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   i better go to bed.

                               theo
                   are you sure?

                               nell
                   i think so.

                               theo
                   okay.
