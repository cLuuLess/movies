     int. living room, nell's apartment - day

     -- becoming a fight.  jane, 30s, dark-haired, furious, wheels
     across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.

                               jane
                   it'll take a month to probate the
                   will, nell!  a month!  even if
                   mother left you something, you
                   won't get it in time to pay the
                   rent.  so instead of complaining,
                   you should be thanking lou for
                   getting you these two weeks to get
                   mother's things packed.

     at first we can't even see who she's yelling at.  at first we don't
     even notice her.  then we do...

     holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain,
     like a part of the faded room is eleanor vance, 20's -- nell.
     she stares at the door.  the clothes line raps at the begrimed
     glass.

                               jane (cont'd)
                   nell?

     the wind dies, the banging stops.  nell seems to hear jane and 
     peers over at her, then across the room to jane's bored husband,
     lou.  he's turning a franklin mint commemorative coin set in his
     hands, studying it.

                               lou
                   you're still going to have to
                   settle with your mother's landlord 
                   on the back rent.

     nell watches jane's little boy, richie.  unpacified by the 
     cartoons on the tv, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through 
     neat rows of delicate porcelain dolls.

                               nell
                   i'm not going to stay.  i'll get a 
                   job.  i'll get my own apartment.

     richie knocks a porcelain doll off, and it breaks all over the 
     carpet.  his parents don't notice.  but nell feels it in the soul.  
     richie stops.  a long beat.  he looks at her, insolent, then plows 
     on with his tank.

                               jane
                   nell.  a job?  two months and
                   where is this job?  you have no
                   degree, you've never worked --

     nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.

                               nell
                   -- i've never worked? --

                               jane
                   you have no experience in the
                   world... the regular world.  what 
                   would you put on a resume?
                          (beat, softening)
                   now we all appreciate what you did 
                   for mother.  isn't that right, 
                   lou?

                               lou
                   eleven years.  long time.

                               jane
                   that's why we've been talking.
                   with me getting more time in
                   accessories, and lou at the shop 
                   all day, we need somebody to take 
                   care of richie, do a little 
                   cleaning and cooking.  and in 
                   return you can have the extra 
                   room.

     she goes to lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her 
     generosity.  all nell can do is stare.

     and then: knock knock.  like a shot nell is out of the chair and
     turning for a set of french doors across the room.  it's all 
     reflex.  nell catches herself.

     knock knock.  richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on 
     the wall with a wooden cane and squeals:

                               richie
                   eleanor, help me!  i've got to 
                   pee!

     nell reacts, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of 
     trauma flickers over her face.  the reaction is so strong we 
     instantly know something is very wrong.

                               lou
                   richie, knock it off before i beat 
                   the crap out of you!

     nell turns away, sick, breathing hard.

     jane picks up a jewelry box from a dresser.

                               jane
                   you're sure this is all of 
                   mother's jewelry?  the lawyer said 
                   to make sure we took it to him...
                          (beat)
                   he said there might be some 
                   antique pieces.  have you seen
                   anything?  some of it might be
                   valuable.

     nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry.  jane no longer 
     can bear the weight of nell's stare, checks her watch.  she nods at 
     lou.  lou rises, pocketing the coin set.  richie follows him out.

                               jane (cont'd)
                   think about our offer, nell.  you 
                   don't know how hard it is out 
                   there.
