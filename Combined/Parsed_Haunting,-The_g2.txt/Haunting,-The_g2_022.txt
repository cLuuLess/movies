     int. nell's car - day

     nell looks at the gate, some part of her aware it's a point of no-
     return.  mr. dudley eases over to her window.  mr. dudley gives her 
     one last look and goes to the gate.  he produces a keyring and 
     undoes the padlock.

                               nell
                   why do you need a chain like that?

                               mr. dudley
                   that's a good question.  what is 
                   it about fences?  sometimes a 
                   locked chain makes people on both 
                   sides of the fence just a little 
                   more comfortable.  why would that 
                   be?

     he unwinds the enormous chain, heavy turn after heavy turn.  the 
     gates swing in, revealing hill house.

                               nell
                   is there something about the 
                   house?

                               mr. dudley
                   mrs. dudley'll be waiting for you.

     grinning, dudley steps aside and nell rolls through.  and at that 
     he just grins wider.  nell pulls away.  disturbed, she watches him 
     in the rearview mirror.  she turns and in front of her sprawls hill 
     house.  at center, the features of the oldest part of the house 
     dwarf all others: towering, eye-like windows and the jaws of a 
     grand entry with carved ebony doors.
