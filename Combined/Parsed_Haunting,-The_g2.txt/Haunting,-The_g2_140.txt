     int. great hall - night

     luke and theo drag nell down the stairs into the great hall.  marrow
     brings up the rear.  they retreat for the entry as luke puts his 
     jacket over nell's shoulders.  marrow stops, looks back up the 
     stairs.

                               marrow
                   wait a second!  wait!

     all there is are the sounds of nell, luke and theo making for the 
     hall to the entry.  the house is silent.

                               luke
                   no.

     luke goes out.  but nell pauses, stopping theo with her.

     the house is quiet.  marrow's hand still outstretched.  nell looks
     around the room.  there are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads,
     humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything.
     all turning to her.

     theo looks around, but can't see what nell is seeing.  nell's breath
     comes faster, disoriented, yet aware...

                               nell
                   they're all in here.  all the ones 
                   he killed.  they're just children!  
                   we have to help them!

                               theo
                          (to marrow)
                   come on!  why are we waiting?

     even now, marrow can't believe what he just saw, but theo's voice
     brings him back.  he whirls, grabs onto nell, helps theo drag her 
     out.
