     int. great hall - night

     marrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting.  the 
     faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the 
     darkness.

     marrow approaches it.  the mesh screen is still open.  marrow stands
     there a moment.  then looks in.

     he squats and tries to open the ash-drop.  it doesn't budge; it's
     jammed by the poker nell dropped in.

     marrow considers, then shakes his head, feels stupid for even coming
     in to check.

     suddenly his cell phone rings, startling him.

                               marrow
                   shit.
                          (answering the
                           phone)
                   hello?  yes, this is dr. marrow.
                          (beat)
                   oh, hello.  thank you for 
                   returning the call.
                          (beat)
                   no.  you mean he hasn't returned?
                          (long beat)
                   no, we haven't seen him.
                          (beat)
                   can you tell me, what sort of car 
                   does he drive?
                          (beat, reacting)
                   a toyota...
