     int. great hall - night

     nell, marrow and theo reach the bottom of the stairs and pause.  
     luke is halfway across the room, looking back to make sure they're 
     with him --

     -- and nell digs her heels in, jerking marrow and theo to a stop.  
     she stares.  the others follow her gaze.

     she's looking down the connecting hall, out to the entry at the 
     front doors.  they're open.

                               nell
                   in the night...

     the door bams shut with a concussion that rocks the entire room,
     sweeping luke's jacket under it.  the handles turn, lock down.

     stunned.  all stunned.

     a rush of air.  the house exhales.  silence.  and then creeeeak.  
     they cast their eyes back up the stairs.

     bump bump.  far-off sounds, hair-raising, of infinite variety, carry
     down the halls.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   ...in the dark.

     luke rushes from the room.
