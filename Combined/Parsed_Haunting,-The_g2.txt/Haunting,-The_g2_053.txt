     ext. hill house driveway - night

     marrow slams the door on the passenger side of todd's car.  mary 
     sits there, moaning, glass covering her eye, blood spilling out 
     around the edges.  luke is on her side of the car.

                               luke
                   keep your head back, that's it.

     todd opens his door.  marrow hands him a key.

                               marrow
                   here's my key to the gate.  call 
                   me the second you know anything.

     todd takes it, jumps in.  the two men watch the car drive away.

                               luke
                   that could have been worse.

                               marrow
                   yeah.

     as they turn back, marrow taps luke.

                               marrow
                   luke, can i talk to you?

                               luke
                   sure.

                               marrow
                   because... well, i know i can 
                   trust you.

                               luke
                   why?

                               marrow
                   i've read your tests.

     that was half a joke, and both men smile.  now they're bonded.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   there's something... i... i didn't 
                   tell you everyth1ng about the 
                   house, and about hugh crain... but 
                   i'm asking you not to repeat it.

                               luke
                   i can keep a secret.

     they go in.  the house is outlined by the sky and clouds and the 
     moon.
