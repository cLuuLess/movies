     int. dining room - day

     morning sun filters in through heavy drapes, falling on marrow at 
     the dining table.  nell squeezes behind him and the sideboard behind 
     him to get at the coffee.  nell wears make up, badly applied, and 
     her hair is up in a french twist.

                               nell
                   sorry.

                               marrow
                   for an american you do a good 
                   imitation of the british at their 
                   most apologetic.
                          (veddy british)
                   pardon me.  excuse me, sorry, 
                   sorry...

     nell smiles.  theo walks in the door, sees nell and marrow, nell
     squeezed in behind him.

                               nell
                   am i that bad?

     theo is aware of marrow's curiosity and fascination with nell.  
     there's a jealousy brewing.

                               theo
                   well this is a cozy breakfast.

                               marrow
                   good morning, theo.  luke.

     luke comes in behind theo, tired-looking also.  he goes to the
     sideboard, starts helping himself to breakfast.

                               luke
                   after i went to bed, the second 
                   time, after the... noise... i had 
                   the best night's sleep of my life.  
                   anybody?

     marrow slept badly, we can see it in his eyes.

                               nell
                   yes.  i feel realy rested, too.  
                   theo?

                               theo
                   i guess.  oh, your hair!  it looks 
                   good.

     but she means exactly the opposite.  marrow looks over nell's hair, 
     but she can't stand it.  luke comes over to the table, drops into a 
     chair next to nell, digs into breakfast.  theo's face turns into an
     artificial smile.

                               theo (cont'd)
                   your makeup too.

     nell sits there flustered.  marrow senses the jealousy, isn't quite
     sure what to make of it, and intervenes.

                               marrow
                   eat your breakfast, theo, then 
                   we'll get started on the tests.
