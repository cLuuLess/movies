     int. hall of mirrors - night

     -- the hall of mirrors.  bang bang bang bang...

     the octagonal, mirror-lined pillars cast and re-cast her reflection
     throughout the room.  nell is everywhere in plain sight, but hidden 
     by the very infinity of her images.  the banging grows louder.

                               nell
                   why do you want me?

     the banging ceases.  and then we see the real nell standing there.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   who am i?

     she turns around.  her reflections all turn with her.  except one.  
     for a long moment, we see it but nell doesn't.

     and then she does.

     the reflected nell stands there, hands hanging, silent.

     nell exhales in shuddering fear.  the reflected nell mouths 
     compelling the real nell to whisper with it:

                               nell (cont'd)
                   welcome home, eleanor...

     with that the reflected nell grins and her stomach swells before our
     eyes, pregnant just like carolyn crain.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   no.

     nell runs.
