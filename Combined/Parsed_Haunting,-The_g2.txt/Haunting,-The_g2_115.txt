     int. nell's room - night

     nell lies in her bed, shivering.

                               nell
                   don't leave me.

     theo spreads an extra blanket over nell.

                               theo
                   i'm going to stay with you until 
                   you fall asleep.  and then i'm 
                   going to get some brandy.

                               nell
                   i don't think i want any.

                               theo
                   i do.

     theo spots a small candelabra with strings of crystal beads on the
     bedside table.  she lights the two candles.

     theo goes and turns out the light.  nell lies there watching the
     flicker of the candles play in the crystal.  eddies of heat mingle 
     up the frost-covered glass of the window behind the candelabra.  
     small streaks of frost begin to melt... we see eyes forming in the 
     melting frost, a face begins to form...

     theo watches nell.  there can be a time dissolve.  nell falls 
     asleep.  theo tiptoes out of the room.
