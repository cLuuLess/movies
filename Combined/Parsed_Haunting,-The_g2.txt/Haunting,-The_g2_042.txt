     int. mezzanine - dusk

     as they come out of crain's study theo stops at the top of the 
     stairs, nell behind her.

                               theo
                   jeez.

                               nell
                   i know.

     they stare out at hugh crain, the cracking and shadowing of the 
     swirls of oil that compose his face.  the figure is daunting, but 
     dead.  just a painting.  four different hallways lead into the 
     mezzanine, all dark and endless in the stray light.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   maybe we should wait for them 
                   here.

     theo walks out, swings around.

                               theo
                   which one?  pick any.

     nell looks from one to another.  she doesn't want to.  but she 
     forces a smile and points to one on the left.  they both disappear 
     into the dark gothic hallway.
