     int. greenhouse - next day

     nell stares at the tableaux of hugh crain.  in the morning light it
     seems inert, cold, just a statue.  luke and theo enter.  nell 
     doesn't seem to notice them until they're beside her.

                               theo
                   marrow said the same thing as last 
                   night, he says --
                          (meaning, this is
                           on his now
                           doubtful word)
                   -- that he checked with mrs. 
                   dudley.  and he says that she told 
                   him that all the fireplaces in the 
                   west wing connect to the main 
                   chimney.  he says that he thinks 
                   that the flue was open, and with 
                   the windstorm, he says that what 
                   probably happened was some kind of 
                   freak air current --

                               nell
                   -- what do you think?

     theo considers, then looks at her, severe.

                               luke
                          (lowers his voice)
                   don't tell the professor; he'd 
                   probably throw me out.  but test 
                   taking is one of the ways i've 
                   been supporting myself.  i 
                   volunteer for every paid study 
                   that they offer.  of course 
                   straight psych stuff doesn't pay 
                   as much as the pharmaceuticals do, 
                   or a good wound study.  check it 
                   out.

     he rolls up his sleeve revealing large, livid scars at intervals too
     regular to be anything natural.

                               luke (cont'd)
                   a thousand dollars each.  am i 
                   sick?  yes.  do you know why i 
                   only date freshmen?  by the time 
                   they're sophomores, they've 
                   figured me out.

                               theo
                          (get back on track!)
                   mister very talky, would you 
                   please say what it is about this 
                   study that bothers you?

                               luke
                   the whole thing feels like 
                   experimental misdirection.  like 
                   he says it's about one thing, a 
                   psychological profile of 
                   environmental effects on 
                   insomnia... and that'd be a 
                   legitimate study, but i think that 
                   we've been subjected to an 
                   academic bait and switch; he's 
                   really looking at something else.

                               nell
                   no.  no... jim's not doing -- 
                   these things.

     but there's a desperate, rising edge to nell's voice.  theo's, in
     response, is quiet, sober... certain.

                               theo
                   then who is?  come on, nell.  deep 
                   down, if you really thought it 
                   wasn't jim, why wouldn't you be 
                   leaving right this second?  why 
                   wouldn't you be afraid?  really 
                   afraid.

                               nell
                   because i don't want to ruin 
                   things.  because home is where the 
                   heart is.

     theo is chilled by this answer which would only make sense to 
     someone out of her mind.

     nell looks up and sees the double staircase at the end of the
     greenhouse... the one where crain's wife killed herself.

     and for a moment we see crain's wife hanging there and then the 
     image is gone...
