     int. nell's car - day

     nell takes a final switchback, and something off to the right 
     catches her eye, then is gone in the trees.  she watches again for 
     it.  there.  a glimpse of a gray stone property wall set back 
     twenty yards from the road.

     there it is again.  moss-greened, twenty feet high, a wicked array 
     of iron spikes and glass mortared atop it.

     and then out of the tangled forest in front of her looms a pair of
     immense stone pillars.  between them, a steel gate as high as the 
     wall, chained and padlocked.
