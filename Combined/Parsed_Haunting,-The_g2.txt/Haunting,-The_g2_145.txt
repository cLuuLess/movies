     ext. main gate - night

     the car fishes back and forth against the gate, hurling a shower of
     gravel on the other cars off to the side of the road.  marrow, nell 
     and theo move back.

     one of the buick's headlights breaks.  the grill mashes in.  for a 
     long moment the car struggles against the gate.  no good.  luke 
     eases up.

     theo looks at marrow.  luke puts the car in reverse.

                               luke
                   get the hell out of the way!

     they back way up.  luke vanishes up the drive in the car.  and then 
     the buick comes around the corner, accelerating, slicing down the 
     gravel road.
