     int. nell's bathroom - night

     marrow lunges into the bathroom, thrown from sleep as luke stares in
     impotent shock.  theo is there behind marrow an instant later.

                               marrow
                   what is it?

     luke can't make any words come out.  marrow shoves him aside, grabs 
     the doorknob and thrashes at it.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   help me!

     he braces luke up, and then they lunge together, shouldering the 
     door.  it splinters out of its frame --
