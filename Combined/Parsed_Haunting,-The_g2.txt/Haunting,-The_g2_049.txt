     the grand entry, where they bump into luke sanderson, 20's, charming
     and cynical.

                               luke
                   hi, luke sanderson, bad sleeper,

                               nell

                   you'll never guess.

     she won't answer.

     marrow comes in the front door.  he looks at the house like 
     macarthur studying a beachhead.

                               marrow
                   there we are.  you're eleanor, 
                   you're luke, you're theo.

                               all
                   hi... hello... dr. marrow...

                               marrow
                   and this is todd, he just came up.

     todd comes in.

                               todd
                   hi.  i'm todd aubochon.

                               luke
                          (1950's alien 
                           spaceman)
                   greetings fellow insomniac.

                               todd
                          (playing)
                   greetings fellow sheep counter.

                               marrow
                   and this is my assistant, mary 
                   lambretta.

                               luke
                   greetings.

     and mary enters.  crossing the threshold, she catches her breath, 
     and when she comes into the hall and sees everyone, she also sees 
     the house in its detail.  and she has a bad feeling.

     marrow is still putting everyone at ease.

                               marrow
                   eleanor, how was the drive?

                               nell
                   you can call me nell, dr. marrow.

                               marrow
                   nell.  good enough.  and i'm jim.

                               nell
                   i'm really... honored to be part 
                   of this study, jim.

                               marrow
                   well... we're glad to have you.

     his smile is devastating.  nell reddens, instantly taken by marrow's
     warmth, observant sensitivity.  theo notices.

                               marrow
                   have either of you seen david 
                   watts?

                               theo
                   no, but nell's been here longer 
                   than i have.

                               nell
                   i only saw theo drive up.

                               luke
                   who's watts?

                               marrow
                   the man who completes the group.

     for a long moment they stand there, silent, looking at each other --
     polite smiles, but awkward, even marrow.  one by one they all look 
     to him for a cue.

                               marrow (cont'd)
                   well, why don't we get some dinner 
                   while we're waiting for him?
                          (beat, backing 
                           through the doors 
                           to the great hall)
                   welcome to hill house, everyone.
