     int. nell's room - night

     nell finishes putting things away in drawers.  theo watches, leaning 
     in the doorway.  nell looks around at the room: and this is her new
     family's new home.  theo smiles sweetly at her, comes over.  an 
     awkward moment, as the seriousness drains away.

                               theo
                   ever try putting your hair up in a 
                   french twist?

     theo reaches for nell's hair.  nell pulls away.  theo pauses.  nell
     realizes she shouldn't have pulled back.

                               nell
                   sorry.  i'm not used to being 
                   touched.

     she moves closer to let theo examine her hair.  theo takes nell's 
     hair, holds it up in a french twist.

                               theo
                   you've been out of the world for a 
                   long time, haven't you?

                               nell
                   yes.  i've missed it.

                               theo
                   no.  the world has missed you.

     cautiously, nell peers in a mirror at herself... and likes what she
     sees.  theo lets nell's hair drop.  theo moves for the door.

                               nell
                   good night, theo.

                               theo
                   you, too.  happy tossing and 
                   turning.
