     int. grand stairway/mezzanine - day

     mrs. dudley glides up the stairs.  nell follows, hoisting her 
     suitcase after her.  it appears the mezzanine ahead leads to a 
     hallway.  but as we draw closer what we thought was a hallway is an 
     enormous oil painting.  in it stands a man, his features lost in 
     the shadows above, only his body visible.

     the nameplate reads hugh crain.

                               nell
                   hugh crain.

     nell looks up: mrs. dudley waits coldly at the top of the stairs.
