     int. great hall - night

     marrow, theo and luke barge into the great hall.

                               theo
                   nell!

                               luke
                   we can't stay here looking for 
                   her.  she doesn't want to be 
                   found...

     marrow and theo look at him.  it's what they've been thinking, but
     haven't had the courage to say.  theo stops suddenly.  turns around.  
     the men notice, and pause.

     then they hear it.  faint.  floating down from upstairs somewhere.
     nell's tune.  it doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's
     coming from so far away.

     they look at each other, start for the stairs.
