     int. nell's kitchen - day

     nell rams through the door into the small kitchen, spotless, empty.
     and then bursts into tears.  shaking, she digs in her back pocket 
     and pulls out a fine filigree necklace.  her mother's.  it's from 
     an age gone by.

     clutching the necklace, she goes back out the door.
