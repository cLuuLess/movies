     int. back stairway - day

     nell looks down from the top of the stairs.  below mrs. dudley and
     theo, 20s, exotic, sophisticated, in vera wang leather, wrestle with
     a pile of designer luggage.  theo peers up.  she's dark, sexy in an
     amused, worldly way: someone who has seen and done it all.

                               theo
                   you may think i have a sickness 
                   about packing, but asking people 
                   to help me shlep the stuff i take 
                   with me everywhere is a cheap and 
                   exploitative way of making new 
                   friends.  my name's theo.

     theo foists a very heavy bag off on mrs. dudley who looks like she's
     been handed a snake.  that makes nell smile.  she comes running down 
     to help with the bags.

                               nell
                   i'm eleanor but everyone calls me 
                   nell.  eleanor vance.  nell.  i'm 
                   really glad you're here.  really.

     theo is a little thrown by nell's gushing.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   what a beautiful jacket.

     theo looks her over... and understands.  nell is desperate to be 
     liked.

                               theo
                   and what you're wearing, that's 
                   great, too.

                               nell
                   this?  it's from a thrift shop.

                               theo
                   what did it cost?

                               nell
                   fifteen dollars.

                               theo
                   that'd be seventy in new york.  
                   you stole it!

                               nell
                          (embarrassed by the 
                           simple truth)
                   it's all i could afford.

                               theo
                   wait.  you're not wearing that 
                   ironically?  this is really you?

                               nell
                   i don't know what you mean.

     mrs. dudley, walking ahead, looks back at them.  then continues up. 
     theo makes a face at mrs. dudley's back.  nell smiles, a little.

                               theo
                   a week.  you and i?  we're going 
                   to have fun.
