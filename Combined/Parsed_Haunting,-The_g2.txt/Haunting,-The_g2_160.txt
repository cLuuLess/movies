     int. hallway outside locked room - night

     theo, marrow and luke stand at the end of the dark hallway.  they 
     stare at the gaping doors to the nursery at the far end.  the tune 
     is coming from within.  abruptly, it stops.

     and instead of nell's tune, there's a repetitive creak.  creak.  
     creak.

     in rising dread, theo starts forward.

     it takes marrow and luke a moment to come after her.  the creaking 
     gets louder, unnerving.

     they get to the doors, theo first.  she pushes them wide.
