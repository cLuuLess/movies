     int. theo's room - night

     the room is a lot less frightening now, especially with the lights 
     on.  nell sits on theo's bed.  theo looks at the walls, silent, 
     normal.

                               theo
                   i did just take a bath.

     when nell doesn't respond for a moment, theo turns to her, sees her
     wrestling with herself.

                               nell
                   mother always banged on the wall 
                   when she needed me.  the night she 
                   died... i heard her, but i 
                   pretended i didn't.  i was just so 
                   sick of it all.  and then the 
                   banging stopped.  and in the 
                   morning... she was dead.  this is 
                   the first i've ever said this to 
                   anyone.  that was the job i had, 
                   theo, it's the only job i've ever 
                   known, and i failed.  i'm actually 
                   a bad person, theo.  the world 
                   doesn't need me.

     theo shakes her head, brushes at her eyes.  the confession, on the 
     top of the fright, has moved her deeply.

                               theo
                   oh, nell.  eleven years.  with all 
                   due respect to your mother who i'm 
                   sure was a saint, i'd have called 
                   doctor kevorkian, if not for her, 
                   for me.

     it's such a horrible thought it makes nell smile, and they share a
     tearful laugh.
