     int. kitchen - day (continuous)

     -- and comes through into a vast kitchen.  a woman in black with 
     her back to nell stands at a counter.  the moaning comes from a
     disreputable old can opener.

     nell breaths, feels stupid.  the woman senses her, turns from her 
     cans of potatoes.  she is mrs. dudley, sallow, unsmiling.

                               mrs. dudley
                   it's make the soup or answer the 
                   door.  can't do both.

                               nell
                   mrs. dudley.

                               mrs. dudley
                   so far.

     mrs. dudley wipes her hands, regards nell, nods.

                               nell
                   i'm eleanor vance, i'm with --

                               mrs.  dudley
                   -- dr. marrow's group.  you're the 
                   first.

     mrs. dudley just stares with her sunken face.  it unsettles nell.

                               mrs. dudley (cont'd)
                   i'll show you your room.
