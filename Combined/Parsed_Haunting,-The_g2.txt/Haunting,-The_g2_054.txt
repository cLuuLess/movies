     int. mezzanine - night

     luke catches up with nell and theo as he reaches the mezzanine.  the
     painting of hugh crain, barely visible in the shadows, looms right
     behind.

                               luke
                   he said that hugh crain... hugh 
                   crain was a monster.  he said that 
                   he was a brutal, horrible man.  he 
                   told me that crain drove his 
                   workers to early deaths.  crain 
                   had children chained to the looms 
                   in his mill.  and listen to this: 
                   his beautiful rene killed herself.

                               theo
                   and why didn't marrow tell us?
                   doesn't he trust women?  that 
                   fuck.

                               nell
                          (she's thinking 
                           about the story, 
                           not marrow)
                   a monster?  but he built this for 
                   the woman he loved, like the taj 
                   mahal.

                               theo
                   the taj mahal wasn't a palace, it
                   was a tomb.  why didn't he tell 
                   us?

                               luke
                   he's trying to protect the 
                   experiment.  personally, i don't 
                   think he's got a large enough 
                   sample for valid results, but as 
                   long as the money's good, and the 
                   food is good, i'm in.

     he heads off.  theo turns to find nell staring at the animal heads 
     on the stairs.  theo touches her.  she starts.

                               theo
                   nell, it was an accident.
