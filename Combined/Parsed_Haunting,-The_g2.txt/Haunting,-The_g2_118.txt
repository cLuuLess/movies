     int. hallway outside kitchen - night

     luke stops theo, carrying a tray of food and tea, outside the 
     kitchen door.

                               theo
                   we're fucked.  we're in a haunted 
                   house and we can't get out until 
                   the morning.

                               luke
                   you don't really believe it's 
                   haunted... do you believe in 
                   ghosts?

                               theo
                   that depends on your definition of 
                   ghosts.  i'm going to check on 
                   her, and then i'm going to stay 
                   awake.

                               luke
                   all night?

                               theo
                   yeah.

                               luke
                   you want company?

                               theo
                   maybe someday.

     some sexual awareness.
