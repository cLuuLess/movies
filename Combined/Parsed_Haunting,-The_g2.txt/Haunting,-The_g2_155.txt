     int. hall outside locked room - night

     nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors, once locked,
     now inexplicably open.  the mythological frieze on the door split in
     half, a world cut in two, a seal broken.  like something has come 
     out of its tomb.

     nell steps into the blackness.
