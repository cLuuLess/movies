     int. theo's room - night (continuous)

     -- her bedroom and slams the door.  a long, deadly silent moment.

                               nell (cont'd)
                   it's in my room.

     but their breath no longer fogs.  theo seems to notice the fact just 
     as nell starts for her room and... knock knock knock.  behind them.  
     at the door to the hall.

                               luke (oc)
                   hey!  i heard screaming...

                               theo
                   luke.

     she grabs for the door and lets luke in.
