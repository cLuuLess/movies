     int.  kitchen - night

     jack enters.  space monkeys render fat and make soap.  they
     pinch herbs, adding them to the mix.  they add vodka.  off
     to the side, a couple monkeys stir a vat of rice.  on the
     wall is a big bulletin board with hundreds of driver's
     licenses; a sign above it: "human sacrifices."

                             freckled space monkey
                 "you are not a beautiful and unique
                 snowflake.  you are the same decaying
                 organic matter as everything else.
                 we are all part of the same compost
                 heap."

                             jack (v.o.)
                 planet tyler.

     jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

                             freckled space monkey
                 "we are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world."

     jack picks up a bottle of vodka.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i had to hug the walls, trapped
                 inside this clockwork of space
                 monkeys, cooking and working and
                 sleeping in teams.
