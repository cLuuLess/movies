     ext. auto shop - day

     a mechanic with a battered face uses a hose to wash the
     sidewalk.  as men pass, he jerks the hose up and sprays them.

                             first man
                 hey... hey...

                             second man
                 watch out, jackass!

     these men continue on their way.

     the mechanic sprays a third man, a seminary student, who
     looks down, stunned.

                             seminarian
                 you... you did that on purpose!

     the mechanic douses the seminarian.  the seminarian grabs
     the hose, wrestling the mechanic for it.  the mechanic
     shoves the seminarian, who responds with a half-assed punch.
     the mechanic purposely takes it.  the seminarian starts to
     run away.  the mechanic sprints after him, punching the
     seminarian in the back of the neck.  they fight.
