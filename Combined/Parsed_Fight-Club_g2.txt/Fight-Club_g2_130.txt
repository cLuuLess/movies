     int. boss's office - day

     jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.
     boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

                             jack
                 we need to talk.

                             boss
                 okay.  where to begin?  with your
                 constant absenteeism?  with your
                 unpresentable appearance?  you're up
                 for review...

                             jack
                 i am jack's complete lack of surprise.

     boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

                             jack
                 let's pretend.  you're the department
                 of transportation, and you discover
                 that our company intentionally did
                 nothing about leather seats cured in
                 third world countries with chemicals
                 we know cause birth defects?  brake
                 linings that fail after a thousand
                 miles.  fuel injectors that burn
                 people alive.

                             boss
                 just who the fuck do you think you
                 are?!  get out!  you're fired!

                             jack
                 what about this?  keep me on payroll
                 as an outside consultant.  in
                 exchange for my salary, i'll keep my
                 mouth shut.  i won't need to come to
                 the office.  i can do this job from
                 home.

     boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

                             boss
                 you little fucker!  i oughta...

     jack punches himself in the nose.  blood starts to trickle.
     he punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by
     the force of the punch, slams against a framed picture and
     shatters the glass.  he falls to the floor.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i am jack's smirking revenge.

     jack gets back to his feet.

                             jack
                 please... don't hit me again, please.
                 i'm your responsibility...

     he punches himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.
     he reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents
     flying.  he hits the floor.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 for some reason, i thought of my
                 first fight -- with tyler.

     jack crawls toward boss, dripping blood, grabs boss's leg.

                             jack
                 please... give me the paychecks like
                 i asked for.  i won't be any trouble.
                 you won't see me again.

     jack climbs up boss's leg while boss tries to shake him off.
     boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 under and behind and inside
                 everything this man took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     jack crawls high enough to grab boss's belt, hoisting
     himself up.  he dribbles blood an boss's clothing, smudges
     blood from his face onto the knuckles of boss's hand.

                             jack
                 please... please...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 and right then, at our most excellent
                 moment together...

     two security guards enter and gape at the sight.  behind
     them stand curious workers, looking in.

                             jack
                       (gurgling blood)
                 please don't hit me again.
