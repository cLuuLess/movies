     int. paper st. house - kitchen - morning

     jack, his face showing new bruises and cuts, makes coffee
     with a wire-mesh strainer.  tyler shuffles in, wearing a
     flannel bathrobe.  he spears pieces of bread on a fork,
     starts roasting them over a burner.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 there were no neighbors.  just
                 warehouses and the paper mill.  the
                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
                 smell of wood chips.
