     int. marla's room - moments later

     marla leads jack inside.

                             jack
                 this is a sweet side of you.  picking
                 these up for ...
                       (reads the boxes:)
                 "mrs. haniver" and... "mrs. raines."
                 where are they?

                             marla
                 tragically, they're dead.  i'm alive
                 and i'm in poverty.  you want any?

                             jack
                 no, thanks.

                             marla
                 good.

     he stares at her while she eats.

                             marla
                 what happened to your hand?

     jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

                             jack
                 nothing.
