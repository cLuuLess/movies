     ext. back yard - night

     jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  in the background, a
     space monkey whacks an applicant with a broom.  it's a
     ritual; no words.  other space monkeys tend the garden.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i'm all alone.  i am jack's broken
                 heart.

     jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  a
     space monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

                             jack
                 get away from me!

                             marla's voice (o.s.)
                 who are all these people?

     jack turns, sees marla with an overnight bag.

                             jack
                 the paper street soap company.

                             marla
                 can i come in?

                             jack
                 he's not here.

                             marla
                 what?

                             jack
                 he's not here!  tyler's not here
                 anymore!  he's gone away!

     marla stares at jack, miserable.  a tear runs down her
     cheek.  she turns and walks away.  jack watches her go.
     there's a loud commotion from the house, voices shouting.
     jack heads to the back door...
