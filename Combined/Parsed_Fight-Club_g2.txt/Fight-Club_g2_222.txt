     int. diner - moments later

     marla sits in a booth.  jack sits across from her.

                             marla
                 i don't want to hear anything you've
                 got to say.

                             jack
                 give me a minute, marla, alright...
                 just sixty seconds.

                             marla
                 sixty seconds, then i'm out of here.

                             jack
                 absolutely, you have every right.  i
                 need you to do me a favor.

                             marla
                 i've done you enough favors.

     a waiter with a black eye appears at the table.

                             waiter
                 sir!  anything you order is free of
                 charge, sir.

                             marla
                 why is it free of charge?

                             jack
                 because... i'm tyler durden.

                             marla
                 then, i'll have the clam chowder...
                 fried chicken and a baked potato with
                 everything and a chocolate chiffon
                 pie.

     jack look to the pass-through window into the kitchen where
     three cooks look out with stitches in their faces.

                             jack
                 clean food, please.

                             waiter
                 in that case, sir, may i advise
                 against the lady eating the clam
                 chowder?

                             jack
                 thanks, no clam chowder.  that's it.

     the waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

                             marla
                 you got about thirty seconds.

                             jack
                       (takes a deep breath)
                 i know that i've been... unwell.  i
                 know it's been like there's two sides
                 to me.

                             marla
                 two sides?  you're dr. jeckle and mr.
                 jackass.

                             jack
                 i deserve that.  anyway, i've... i've
                 only just realized

                             marla
                 what?

                             jack
                 i mean, the depth and breadth of our
                 relationship has only recently been
                 illuminated for me.  i know this...
                 i know us hasn't been such a great
                 thing for you...

                             marla
                 whatever.
                       (to waiter)
                 i'll take my food to go...

     marla's getting up to go, but jack rises, fed up, takes her
     by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

                             jack
                 sit down!  sit down and give me my
                 last fifteen seconds without opening
                 your mouth!

     marla crosses her arms.  jack collects himself.

                             jack
                 i'm trying to tell you -- and this is
                 where you have to trust me -- but, i
                 think your life might be in real
                 danger.

                             marla
                 what?

                             jack
                 you have to get out of here.  leave
                 as soon as possible.  go to any rural
                 town, away from any major city...

                             marla
                 you are an insane person.

                             jack
                 marla...

                             marla
                 no, no, shut up!  i've had enough.
                 i tried, tyler... i have tried...

     marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

                             marla
                 there's a part of you i really like,
                 but i can't do this anymore.  i just
                 can't.  this is killing me...

                             jack
                 i'm sorry, but i...

                             marla
                 what?!  you're sorry?  i don't
                 believe that for a minute.

     marla gets up.  jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading
     for the door.  jack gathers his files, runs to follow...
