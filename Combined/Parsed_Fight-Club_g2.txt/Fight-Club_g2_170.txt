     jack comes out, walks around ricky, hands in his pockets,
     unsure.  tyler watches, nods for jack to go ahead.

                             jack
                 uh, look.  you're too... young to...
                 train here.  you should probably be
                 on you way.

     no response from ricky, who remains at attention.  jack goes
     back inside.  tyler closes the door.
