                             marla
                 yeah?

                             jack
                 marla, it's me.  have we... have we
                 ever had sex?

                             marla
                 what kind of stupid question is
                 that?!

                             jack
                 because the answer's "yes" or because
                 the answer's "no?"

                             marla
                 is this a trick?

                             jack
                 will you just answer me, for
                 christsake?!

                             marla
                 you mean, you want to know if i think
                 we were just having sex or making
                 love?

                             jack
                 we did make love?

                             marla
                 is that what you're calling it?

                             jack
                 answer the question!

                             marla
                 you fuck me, then snub me.  you love
                 me, you hate me.  you show me your
                 sensitive side, then you turn into a
                 total asshole!  is that a pretty
                 accurate description of our
                 relationship, tyler?

                             jack (v.o.)
                 we've just lost cabin pressure.

                             jack
                 what did you say... ?

                             marla
                 what is wrong with you?

                             jack
                 say my name.

                             marla
                 what... ?

                             jack
                 say my name!  what's my name!?

                             marla
                 tyler durden!  tyler durden, you
                 fucking freak.  what's going on?  i'm
                 coming over there...

                             jack
                 marla, no, wait...

     as marla hangs up.  jack stares at the receiver, dazed...

                             tyler's voice
                 we've got six fight clubs in chicago
                 now...

     jack spins, dropping the phone -- tyler sits beside him.

                             tyler
                 four in milwaukee.

                             jack
                 what's this all about, tyler?

                             tyler
                 and, we're definitely filling a void
                 in the rural south.

                             jack
                 why do people think i'm you?

                             tyler
                 you broke your promise.  you talked
                 to her about me.

                             jack
                 why do people think i'm tyler durden?

                             tyler
                 why did you do that?

                             jack
                 answer me, tyler.

                             tyler
                 why do people think anything?

                             jack
                 i don't know!  tell me!

     tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.

                             tyler
                 people think that you're me, because
                 you and i happen to share the same
                 body.

                             jack
                 what... ?

                             tyler
                 is this really news to you?

                             jack
                 what are you talking about... ?

                             tyler
                 sometimes i control it, and you
                 imagine yourself watching me...

     flashback - hallway - night

     commissioner jacobs checks his tie in a mirror, goes to open
     the door of the men's bathroom -- face to face with jack.

     flashback - lou's bar basement - night

     jack stands surrounded by eager fight club members, under
     the bare bulb, talking and behaving like tyler...

                             jack
                 the first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.
