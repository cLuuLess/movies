     int. office building basement - night

     jack stands with a weeping middle-aged woman.  he begins to
     cry along with her.  a sign by the door: "onward and upward."

                             jack (v.o.)
                 if i didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  they cried
                 harder.  i cried harder.
