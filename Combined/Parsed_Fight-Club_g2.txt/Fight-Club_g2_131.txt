     int. tyler's house - entrance foyer - day

     jack holds a check in front of tyler's face.

                             jack
                 six months advance pay.  six months!

                             tyler
                 fucking sweet.

                             jack
                 okay, and... and...

     jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of cards.

                             jack
                 forty-eight airline flight coupons.
                 plus... hold on... just a minute...

     jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  he
     drags an unwieldy shopping cart in behind him; filled with
     his computer, phone, fax and other office equipment.

                             jack
                 i am now officially self-employed.

     jack looks at the cart, then back at tyler, proud.

                             tyler
                 good for you.
