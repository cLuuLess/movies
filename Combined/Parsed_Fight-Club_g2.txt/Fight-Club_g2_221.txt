     ext. marla's hotel - sunset

     jack's taxi halts.  marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees
     jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

                             jack
                 marla!

     marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  jack follows,
     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

                             jack
                 marla...

                             marla
                 your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
                 with a fucking broom.  i thought they
                 were going to break my arm.

                             jack
                 i'm sorry, i...

                             marla
                 the were burning their fingertips
                 with lye.  the stink was unbelievable.

                             jack
                 marla... i need to talk to you.  it's
                 going to take a tremendous act of
                 faith on your part for you to hear me
                 out.

                             marla
                 here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

     marla heads into a diner.  jack follows...

                             jack
                 -- a little more faith than that.
