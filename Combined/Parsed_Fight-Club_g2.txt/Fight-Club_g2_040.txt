     int. airport - night

     jack stands at a gate counter.  an attendant smiles at him.

                             attendant
                 check-in for that flight doesn't
                 begin for another two hours, sir.

     jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and
     looks at an overhanging clock.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 pacific, mountain, central.  lose an
                 hour, gain an hour.  this is your
                 life, and it's ending one minute at
                 a time.
