     int. airplane cabin - moving down runway

     jack is speaking to the businesswoman next to him.

                             jack
                 if x is less than the cost of a
                 recall, we don't do one.

                             busisness woman
                 are there a lot of these kinds of
                 accidents?

                             jack
                 oh, you wouldn't believe.

                             business woman
                 ... which... car company do you work
                 for?

                             jack
                 a major one.

     turgid silence.  jack turns to the window.  he sees a
     pelican get sucked into the turbine.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 every time the plane banked too
                 sharply on take-off or landing, i
                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
                 collision -- anything.

     jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
     buckles -- the cabin wobbles.  people panic.  masks drop.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 no more haircuts.  nothing matters,
                 not even bad breath.

     the side of the plane shears off!  screaming passengers are
     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
     wind.  magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 life insurance pays off triple if you
                 die on a business trip.

     jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

     ding! -- the seatbelt light goes out.  jack snaps awake.
     everything is normal.  some passengers get out of their
     seats.  from next to jack, a voice we've heard before...

                             voice
                 there are three ways to make napalm.
                 one, mix equal parts of gasoline and
                 frozen orange juice...

     jack turns to see tyler.  without turned to jack, tyler
     continues:

                             tyler
                 two, equal parts gasoline and diet
                 cola.  three, dissolve kitty-litter
                 in gasoline until the mixture is
                 thick.

                             jack
                 pardon me?

     tyler turns to jack.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 this is how i met --

                             tyler
                 tyler durden.

     tyler offers his hand.  jack takes it.

                             tyler
                 you know why they have oxygen masks
                 on planes?

                             jack
                 no, supply oxygen?

                             tyler
                 oxygen gets you high.  in a
                 catastrophic emergency, we're taking
                 giant, panicked breaths...

     tyler grabs a safety instruction card from the seatback,
     hands it to jack.

                             tyler
                 suddenly, we become euphoic and
                 docile.  we accept our fate.

     tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

                             tyler
                 emergency water landing, 600 miles
                 per hour.  blank faces -- calm as
                 hindu cows.

     jack laughs.

                             jack
                 what do you do, tyler?

                             tyler
                 what do you want me to do?

                             jack
                 i mean -- for a living.

                             tyler
                 why?  so you can say, "oh, that's
                 what you do." -- and be a smug little
                 shit about it?

     jack laughs.  tyler reaches under the seat in front of him
     and lifts a briefcase.

                             tyler
                 you have a kind of sick desperation
                 in your laugh.

     jack points to his own briefcase.

                             jack
                 we have the same briefcase.

     tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward jack.

                             tyler
                 open it.

     jack looks at tyler, then pops the latches and raises the
     lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of soap.

                             tyler
                 soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
                       (reaches in his pocket)
                 i make and sell soap...

     tyler hands jack his card.  "the paper street soap company."

                             tyler
                 if you were to add nitric acid to the
                 soap-making process, one would get
                 nitroglycerin.  with enough soap, one
                 could blow up the world, if one were
                 so inclined.

     tyler snaps the briefcase shut.  jack stares.

                             jack
                 tyler, you are by far the most
                 interesting "single-serving" friend
                 i've ever met.

     tyler stares back.  jack, enjoying his own chance to be
     witty, leans closer to tyler.

                             jack
                 you see, when you travel, everything
                 is small, self-contained--

                             tyler
                 the spork.  i get it.  you're very
                 clever.

                             jack
                 thank you.

                             tyler
                 how's that working out for you?

                             jack
                 what?

                             tyler
                 being clever.

                             jack
                       (thrown)
                 well, uh... great.

                             tyler
                 keep it up, then.  keep it right up.

     tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

                             tyler
                 ... as i squeeze past, do i give you
                 the ass or the crotch?

     tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

                             tyler
                 we are defined by the choices we make.

     tyler goes to the curtain dividing first class, slaps the
     curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  jack watches.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 how i came to live with tyler is:
                 airlines have this policy about
                 vibrating luggage.
