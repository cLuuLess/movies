     int. jack's office - day

     jack's clothes are permanently stained with blood.  he sits
     in zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing haiku.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i faxed them around to everyone.

     he hits "send," gets the "error chime" sound.  he presses
     this key over and over.  boss enters.

                             boss
                 is that your blood?

                             jack
                 some of it, yes.

     boss stares at jack like he's from mars.

                             boss
                 take the rest of the day off.  come
                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.
                 get yourself together.
