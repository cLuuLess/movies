     int. kitchen - moments later

     jack enters.  tyler, dressed in fatigues and splattered with
     paint, grabs beers from the refrigerator.

                             jack
                 hey.

                             tyler
                 hey.

     jack notices rope and rappelling tools on the table.  tyler
     comes to hand jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.

                             tyler
                 go on in.  we're celebrating.
