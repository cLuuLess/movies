     int. kitchen - late afternoon (flashback)

     tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

                             marla's voice
                       (from handset)
                 i'll tell you when i'm floating out
                 of my body.

     tyler smiles.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 how could tyler, off all people, think
                 it was a bad thing that marla singer
                 was about to die?
