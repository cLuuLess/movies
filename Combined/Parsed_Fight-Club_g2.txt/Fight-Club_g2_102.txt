     int. marla's room - continuous (flashback)

     marla pulls tyler inside and shuts the door.  her drugged
     eyes look him over.

                             marla
                 you got here fast.

     she staggers and sits on the bed.  she slides off, along
     with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

                             marla
                 the mattresses are all sealed in
                 slippery plastic.

     she tries to focus her eyes on tyler.

                             marla
                 did i call you?

     tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a dildo
     lying atop a dresser.  marla follows his gaze.

                             marla
                 don't worry.  it's not a threat to you.

     sirens and vehicles screeching outside can be heard; doors
     opening and slamming; running footfalls.

                             marla
                 oh, no!  somebody called the cops...

     she gets to her feet, grabs tyler, pulls him out the door.
