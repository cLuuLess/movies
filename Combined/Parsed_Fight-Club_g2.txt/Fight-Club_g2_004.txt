     int. copy room - day

     jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  his starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 with insomnia, nothing is real.
                 everything is far away.  everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     other people make copies, all with starbucks cups, sipping.
     jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.
