     int. city bus - night

     the driver has a broken nose.  the bus is empty, except for
     jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 he had a plan.  maybe you just didn't
                 see it till it hit you between the
                 eyes.
                       (pause)
                 but, it started to make sense... in
                 a tyler sort of way.  no fear.  no
                 distractions.  the ability to let
                 that which does not matter truly
                 slide.
