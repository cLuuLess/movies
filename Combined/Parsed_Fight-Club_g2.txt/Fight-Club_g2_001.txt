     int.  social room - top floor of high rise -- night

     tyler has one arm around jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a handgun with the barrel lodged in jack's mouth.
     tyler is sitting in jack's lap.

     they are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; tyler
     is blond, handsome; and jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  tyler looks at his watch.

                             tyler
                 one minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 this is the beginning.  we're at
                 ground zero.  maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             jack
                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 with a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             jack
                       (still distorted)
                 i can't think of anything.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 with my tongue, i can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  for a second,
                 i totally forgot about tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and i
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     tyler checks his watch.

                             tyler
                 it's getting exciting now.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 that old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 stories.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 we have front row seats for this
                 theater of mass destruction.  the
                 demolitions committee of project
                 mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  in two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  i know this
                 because tyler knows this.

                             tyler
                 look what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 thirty seconds.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 somehow, i realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about marla singer.

     pull back from jack's face.  it's pressed against two large
     breasts that belong to...bob, 45, a moose of a man.  jack is
     engulfed by bob in an intense embrace.  bob weeps openly.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 bob had bitch tits.

     pull back to wide on...
