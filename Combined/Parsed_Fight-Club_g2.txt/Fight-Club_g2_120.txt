     int. barney's - day

     jack and tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-
     over, wait as a buyer fills out forms.

     there are bars of "the paper street soap company" soap on
     the counter.  jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
     arrested.  his hand is bandaged.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 tyler sold the soap to department
                 stores at twenty bucks a ear.  god
                 knows what they charged.  how ironic.
                 we were selling rich women their own
                 fat asses back to them.
