     flashback - curbside - night

     jack sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway.
     he talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there.

                             jack
                 anyone?
                       (thinks)
                 my boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 who would you fight?

     jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.

                             jack
                 oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 i didn't really know my dad...
