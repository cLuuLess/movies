     int. paper st. house, living room/kitchen - moments later

     jack walks in to find the place empty and deserted.  he
     continues on into the kitchen, gawks at bathtubs and
     canisters holding vast amounts of liquid.  there are hoses,
     gas masks, beakers, test tubes and pumps.

     he picks up a bottle labeled "nitric acid."
