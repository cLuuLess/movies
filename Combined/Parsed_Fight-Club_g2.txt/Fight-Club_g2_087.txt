     int. jack's office - day

     jack, playing solitaire on his computer, daubs blood from
     his mouth with a handkerchief.  boss, passing by the
     doorway, looks in at jack, irritated.

                             boss
                 what are you getting yourself into
                 every week?

     jack keeps playing solitaire.  boss enters, folds his arms.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 after fight club, everything else in
                 your life gets the volume turned
                 down.  you can deal with anything.

                             boss
                 have you finished those reports?

                             jack
                       (handing him reports)
                 yes.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the people who had power over you
                 have less and less.

     jack looks at boss.  reflexively, jack's tongue plays with
     his teeth.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 by this point, i could wiggle most of
                 the teeth in my jaw.
