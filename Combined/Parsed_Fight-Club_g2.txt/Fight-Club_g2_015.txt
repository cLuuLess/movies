     int. public building conference room - night

     everyone, including jack, sits back in their seats, eyes
     closed.  the leader speaks into a microphone.

                             leader
                 tonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i wasn't really dying, i wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; i was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.

                             leader
                 ...and you open the door and you
                 step inside.  we're inside our
                 hearts.  now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  that's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             leader
                 it moves over your body, healing you.
                 keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 where does it lead?  to your cave.
                 step forward into your cave.
