     int. hotel room - bathroom - night

     jack brushes his teeth in the mirror.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 shampoo/conditioner combo.  single-
                 serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

     jack picks up an individual, wrapped q-tip, looks at it.  he
     moves out of the bathroom into...

     main room

     jack sits on the bed.  he turns on the tv.  it's tuned to
     the "sheraton channel," shows waiters serving people in a
     large banquet room.  jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small dinner mint.
