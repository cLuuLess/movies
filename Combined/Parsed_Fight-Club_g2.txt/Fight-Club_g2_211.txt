     flashback - building - night

     the parker morris building.

     jack, bob, ricky, angel face and another guy rappel down the
     side, spraying paint.  jack is "tyler" in demeanor,
     mannerisms, speech...

                             jack
                       (shouting)
                 you are not your job.  you are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

     two windows shatter outward -- two men look out and yell:

                             bruised man #1
                 i am not my job!

                             bruised man #2
                 i am not how much money i have in the
                 bank!
