     int. family household -- night

     father, mother, young daughter and son, eat dinner, watching
     television.  suddenly, the tv image turns to snow and static.

     family members stop eating.  father picks up the remote,
     points it -- all channels are snow.

     father turns the tv off.  he and his family members look at
     each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable.
