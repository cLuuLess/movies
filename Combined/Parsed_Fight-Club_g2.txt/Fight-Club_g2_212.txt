     int. hotel room - resuming

     jack's having trouble catching his breath.  tyler stands.

                             tyler
                 there!  happy?  i asked for one thing
                 from you... one simple promise.  now
                 look what you've done!

                             jack
                 this isn't possible...

                             tyler
                 we're going to have to do something
                 about marla...

                             jack
                 what... what are you saying?

                             tyler
                 it's okay.  we okay... a little
                 codependent, sure, but...

     jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

                             jack
                 no!  this isn't true.  we... we were
                 around other people, together, both
                 of us...

                                  tyler
                 you never talked to me in front of
                 anyone else.

                             jack
                 wrong, wrong -- what about the car
                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?

                             tyler
                 what about them?  they're lunatics.

                             jack
                 you took me to the house.

                             tyler
                 the house is rented in your name.

                             jack
                 you have jobs.

                             tyler
                 night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

                             jack
                 what about marla?

                             tyler
                 what about marla?

                             jack
                 she's... you... you're fucking her.

                             tyler
                 um, well... technically, no.

     jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find
     words, then -- he suddenly faints to the floor, out cold.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 it's called a "changeover."  the
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.
