     int. kitchen - continuous

     jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 to what purpose, might one ask?
                 well, one might ask, if not for the
                 first rule of project mayhem.

     jack turns to look around the kitchen.  three space monkeys
     work -- one scrubbing the floor, one washing dishes, one
     scrubbing the walls.  jack walks out.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 in tyler we trust.
