     int. small protestant church - night

     jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  people
     are chattering with each other.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 -- but, in here, in everyone, there's
                 the squint of a five-day headache.
                 yet they forced themselves to be
                 positive.  they never said
                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  they
                 always talked about getting better.

                             leader
                 okay, everyone.

     everyone sits in chairs.  jack catches sight of marla.

                             leader
                 to open tonight's communion, chloe
                 would like to say a few words.

     taking the lectern is chloe, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  she wears a
     head bondage.  she clears her throat.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 ahh, chloe.  chloe looked the way
                 joni mitchell's skeleton would look
                 if you made it smile and walk around
                 a party being extra nice to everyone.

                             chloe
                 well, i'm still here -- but i don't
                 know for how long.  that's as much
                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but
                 i've got some good news -- i no
                 longer have any fear of death.

     applause from around the room.

                             chloe
                 but... i am in a pretty lonely place.
                 no one will have sex with me.  i'm so
                 close to the end and all i want is to
                 get laid for the last time.  i have
                 pornographic movies in my apartment,
                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     the leader gingerly takes control of the microphone.

                             leader
                 thank you, chloe.  everyone, let's
                 thank chloe.

                             everyone
                 thank you, chloe.
