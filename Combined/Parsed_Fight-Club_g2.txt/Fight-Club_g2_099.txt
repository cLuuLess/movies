     int. kitchen - morning

     jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read reader's digest.
     he hears footsteps approaching.

                             jack
                 you're not going to believe what i
                 dreamt last night.

     marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's
     been raped by a hurricane.  jack's jaw drops.

                             marla
                 i can hardly believe anything about
                 last night.

     marla goes to pour coffee.  she takes a swig, gargles and
     spits it in the sink.  she gives jack a lascivious smile.

                             jack
                 what are you doing here?

                             marla
                 what... ?

                             jack
                 what the hell are you doing here?

     marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

                             marla
                 fuck you.

     marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.
     jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

     jack turns and -- tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
     marla.  he's in his usual sweatpants.  he grins at jack,
     then moves away, pours himself coffee.  jack, smoldering,
     slumps at the table and picks up reader's digest.  tyler
     puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

                             tyler
                 she's a piece of work.  get this --
                 i come in here last night, the
                 phone's off the hook...

     jack pretends to read, quickly glances at tyler.  tyler's
     voice fades...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i already knew the story before he
                 told it to me.
