     int. thrift store - continuous

     marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  an old clerk
     sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

                             jack
                 you're selling those?

     marla steps down hard on jack's foot.  he winces in pain.

                             marla
                       (for the clerk to hear)
                 yes, i'm selling some chothes.

     the clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

                             marla
                 so, we each have three -- that's six.
                 what about the seventh day?  i want
                 ascending bowel cancer.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 the girl had done her homework.

                             jack
                 i want ascending bowel cancer.

     the clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to marla.

                             marla
                 that's your favorite, too?  tried to
                 slip it by me, eh?

                             jack
                 we'll split it.  you get it the first
                 and third sunday of the month.

                             marla
                 deal.

     they shake.  jack tries to withdraw his hand; marla holds it.

                             marla
                 looks like this is goodbye.

                             jack
                 let's not make a big thing out of it.

     she walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

                             marla
                 how's this for not making a big thing?

     jack watches her go.  a moment, then he follows after...
