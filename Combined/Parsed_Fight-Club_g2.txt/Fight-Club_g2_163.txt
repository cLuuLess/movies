     int. stolen car - moving - later

     rain gushes down.  jack stews, silent.  the car moves down
     a highway, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

                             tyler
                 something on your mind?

                             jack
                 no.

     tyler shrugs; turns on the radio, ignores jack.

                             jack
                 why wasn't i told about "project
                 mayhem?"

                             tyler
                 what should i have told you?

                             jack
                 why wasn't i involved from the
                 beginning?  you and i started fight
                 club together.

                             tyler
                 fight club was the beginning.  now
                 it's out of the basements and there's a
                 name for it -- project mayhem.

                             ricky and mechanic
                       (together)
                 the first rule of project mayhem is
                 you do not ask questions.

                             jack
                 this is as much mine as yours.

                             tyler
                 is this a needlepoint club?  is it
                 about you and me?

                             jack
                 you know what i mean.

                             tyler
                 what do you want?  a statement of
                 purpose... ?

                             jack
                 look...

                             tyler
                 should i e-mail you?  should i put
                 this on your "action item list?"

                             jack
                 i want to know --

                             tyler
                 what do you want to know about
                 project mayhem?

                             ricky and mechanic
                       (together)
                 the first rule of project mayhem --

                             jack
                       (to ricky and mechanic)
                 shut up!!
                       (to tyler)
                 i want to know what's going on.

     tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...
     opposing headlights get closer fast...

                             tyler
                 this does not belong to us.  we are
                 not the leaders.  we are not special.

                             jack
                 what are you doing?!

                             tyler
                 we are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world.  we are all part
                 of the same compost heap...

                             jack
                 tyler...

     tyler steers back into the proper lane.  the other car flies
     past, horn sounding...

                             jack
                 what the hell ... ?!

                             tyler
                 you choose your level of involvement.
                 i won't make decisions for you.

                             jack
                 i'm not asking you to.

                             tyler
                 you're asking questions that don't
                 have answers.  you know just as much
                 about project mayhem as anybody else.

                             jack
                 i don't think that's true.

     tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.
     through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a truck.

                             jack
                 tyler... what is this... !

     jack fights	to turn the wheel, but tyler uses both hands.

                             tyler
                 what will you wish you'd done before
                 you died?

                             ricky
                 paint a self-portrait.

                             mechanic
                 build a house.

                             tyler
                       (to jack)
                 and you?

                             jack
                 i don't know!  nothing!

                             tyler
                 if you died right now, how would you
                 feel about your life?

                             jack
                 i would feel nothing about my life?
                 is that what you want to hear?!

     the oncoming truck honks and flashes its lights.  it moves
     to the other side of the road.  tyler steers there, too.

                             tyler
                 i want to hear the truth.

                             jack
                 fuck my life.  fuck fight club.  fuck
                 you and fuck marla.  i'm sick of
                 this.  how's that?

                             tyler
                 why do you think i blew up your condo?

                             jack
                 what?

                             tyler
                 hitting bottom isn't a weekend
                 retreat!  it's not a seminar!  you
                 have to forget everything you know,
                 everything you think you know --
                 about life, about friendship, about
                 you and me.

     nearing impact with the oncoming truck, tyler takes his
     hands off the wheel -- jack keeps his grip, turns the
     wheel... the car swerves...

     the truck roars past, spraying water, horn blasting.

     tyler looks at jack, his hands in the air.  jack looks at
     tyler with dead eyes.

                             jack
                 okay, okay... fine...

     jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.
     tyler studies jack face, impressed.  tyler makes no move to
     take the wheel.

     through thr windshield: a stalled car ahead on the side of
     the road, surrounded by flares.

     jack and tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the
     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  their faces are
     illuminated by the light of the flares.  tyler smiles.

     they smash into the stalled car -- airbags inflate!  the
     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-
     over-tea-kettle roll down a hill...

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i'd never been in a car accident.
                 this must've been what all those
                 statistics felt like before i filed
                 them into my reports.

     the car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.
