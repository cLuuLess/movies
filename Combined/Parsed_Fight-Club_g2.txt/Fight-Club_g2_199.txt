     int. city bus - day

     jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  the bus stops.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 under and behind and inside
                 everything i took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     out the window, a construction worker with a broken nose
     works a jackhammer.  he stops, wipes his brow.
