     int. marla's room - night

     marla stands facing a mirror with her shirt open.  jack
     stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her
     breast.  marla's hand guides his.

                             jack
                 where?  here?

                             marla
                 here.

                             jack
                 there?

                             marla
                 here.

                             jack
                 here.

                             marla
                 feel anything?

                             jack
                 no.

     jack's head is behind marla's.  they speak softer, slower.

                             marla
                 make sure.

                             jack
                 okay.  okay, i'm sure.

                             marla
                 you feel nothing?

                             jack
                 nothing.

     marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

                             marla
                 well, that's a relief.  thank you.

                             jack
                 no... no problem.

                             marla
                 i wish i could return the favor.

     jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

                             jack
                 i think everything's okay here.

                             marla
                 i could check your prostate.

                             jack
                 uh ... nah.

                             marla
                       (pause)
                 well... thanks, anyway.

     marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than
     just friendly.  jack pulls away.

                             jack
                 so.... are we done?

     marla sighs.

                             marla
                 yeah, we're done.  see you around.
