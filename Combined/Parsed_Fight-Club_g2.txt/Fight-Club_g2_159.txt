     int. tavern basement - night

     fight club in full swing.  jack battles angel face, beating
     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i felt like putting a bullet between
                 the eyes of every panda that wouldn't
                 screw to save its species.

     the crowd shouts maniacally, save tyler, who watches with an
     inscrutable stone face.

     angel face tries to speak, but jack pounds too hard.  blood
     flies.  the crowd begins to grow quieter.

                             jack (v.o.)
                 i wanted to open the dump valves on
                 oil tankers and smother all the
                 french beaches i'd never see.

     finally, angel face lies still, unconscious.  jack stops,
     stares down, numb.  jack walks away -- the crowd parts to
     let him pass.  jack scans faces... finds tyler.

                             tyler
                 where did you go, psycho-boy?

                             jack
                 i felt like destroying something
                 beautiful.
