	claudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad,
	sketching the bay of naples. a beautifully realized
	drawing, all in shades of grey and black. louis
	observes.

		louis, your quest is for darkness
		only. this sea is not your sea.
		they myths of men are not your
		myths. their history isn't yours.

	the sketch changes to a sketch of -


	the acropolis

	in the moonlight.

				louis (v.o.)
		we saw the acropolis by moonlight,
		shades of grey and silver. and i
		longed for the brilliant white of
		those marbles in the hot sun of
		homer...

	the sketch changes to a sketch of -


	transylvania

	and the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape.

				louis (v.o.)
		we docked at varna and searched the
		rural countryside of the
		carpathians, for what she liked to
		term "our kind"...


	montage of sketches

	a translyvanian village, a graveyard.

	ruined castle after castle, looking into the skies...

				louis
		the quest for these old world
		vampires filled me with bitterness.
		we searched village after village,
		ruin after ruin and i was glad when
		always we found nothing. for what
		could the damned really have to say
		to the damned?
