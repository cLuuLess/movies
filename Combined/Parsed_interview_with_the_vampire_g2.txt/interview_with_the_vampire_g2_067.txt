	int. claudia's bedroom - night

	canaries sing in a cage, above a child's coffin.

	claudia is writing at a secretaire. she is writing in a
	diary with a quill pen in an adult hand. she murmurs
	the date as she writes.

				claudia
		september 21st, one hour after
		sunset. the sky is still violet,
		the way louis loves and as always
		lestat was gone when we rose.

	she looks up and sees louis in the doorway, watching
	her.

				louis
		how did you learn to write,
		claudia?

				claudia
		the way i learn everything. by
		watching you.

	she closes the diary.

				claudia
		but you never let me see you kill,
		louis.

				louis
		lestat taught you all you need to
		know about that.

				claudia
		infant death, he calls me. sweet
		daughter death. you know what he
		calls you? merciful death.

				louis
		he jests.

				claudia
		why does he call you that?

				louis
		hush, claudia don't talk about such
		things. show me your book.

	she opens it. inside there is a beautiful pen and ink
	portrait of louis.

				louis
		claudia! you did that?

				claudia
		sit still. it's not finished -

	she begins to fill in the sketch.

				louis (v.o.)
		time can pass fast for mortals when
		they're happy. with us it was the
		same.
