	int. hotel suite - night

	louis enters. there is unfamiliar scent in the air, a
	doll sitting by the mirror. louis looks in the mirror
	and sees...


	madeleine

	the doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting
	like a madonna with claudia on her lap. claudia's arms
	are wound round her neck. the contrast between mortal
	woman and immortal child is plain.

				claudia
		madeleine... louis is shy.

	madeleine rises and comes towards louis. she draws back
	the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the
	two marks there. she says softly, dreamily.

				madeleine
		drink.

	louis turns away. claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.

				claudia
		do it louis. because i cannot do
		it. i haven't the strength. you saw
		to that when you made me.

	louis turns to madeleine.

				louis
		you haven't the vaguest conception
		under god of what you ask!

				madeleine
		au contraire, monsieur, i have.

	louis pushes her away. claudia screams.

				claudia
		you have found your new companion,
		louis! you will make me mine!

	louis grips madeleine and shakes her.

				louis
		how do we seem to you? do you think
		us beautiful, magical, our white
		skin, our fierce eyes? drink, you
		ask me! have you any idea of the
		thing you will become?

				claudia
		your evil is that you cannot be
		evil! and i will suffer for it no
		longer!

				louis
		don't make me, claudia! i cannot do
		it!

				claudia
		yet you could do it to me!
		snatching me from my mother's hands
		like two monsters in a fairy-tale!
		couldn't you have waited? six more
		years and i would have had that
		shape! and now you weep! you
		haven't tears enough for what
		you've done to me.

	she points to madeleine

				claudia
		you give her to me! do this before
		you leave me!

	she begins to weep, sobbing like a child.

				claudia
		oh god! i love you still, that's
		the torment of it. but you know i
		must leave you louis...

				louis
		yes...

				claudia
		and who will care for me my love,
		my dark angel, when you are gone?

	louis looks at madeleine

				louis
		you promise to care for her then?

				madeleine
		yes...

				louis
		and you know what you ask for?

	she wraps her arms around claudia.

				madeleine
		yes.

				louis
		what do you think she is,
		madeleine? a doll?

				madeleine
		a child who can't die...

	her finger clutches a locket around her neck, louis
	touches it, opens it.


	the locket

	a picture of a young girl, claudia's age, wistful,
	beautiful.

				louis
			(softly)
		and the child who did die?

				madeleine
		my daughter...

	louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.

				louis
		look at the gaslight. don't take
		your eyes off it. you will be
		drained to the point of death, but
		you must stay alive. do you hear
		me?

				madeleine
		yes!

	louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.
