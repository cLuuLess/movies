	ext. hotel saint gabriel - night

	claudia and louis enter the lobby.

				claudia
		i loathe them! i can't stand the
		sight of them! stupid bourgeois
		parisians, all dressed in black
		like some private club! i've
		searched for them the world over
		and i despise them!

				louis
		what danger?

				claudia
		i can feel it from them! they want
		to know who made us, what became of
		him. they have their rules, their
		idiotic rules!

	they come to their room, enter.
