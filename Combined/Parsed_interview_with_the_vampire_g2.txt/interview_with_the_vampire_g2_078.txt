	int. flat - night

	lestat playing the piano. louis reading. claudia
	enters, wearing a cape and hat. she walks to the piano,
	sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he
	plays.

				lestat
		what is it now? you irritate me!
		your very presence irritates me!

				claudia
			(sweetly)
		does it?

				lestat
		yes. and i'll tell you something
		else! i've met someone who will
		make a better vampire than both of
		you.

				claudia
		is that supposed to frighten me?

				lestat
		you're spoilt because you're an
		only child. you need a brother. or
		i do. i'm weary of you both.

				claudia
		i suppose we could people the world
		with vampires, the three of us.

				lestat
		not you my dear.

				claudia
		you're a liar. but you upset my
		plans.

				lestat
		what plans?

				claudia
		i came to make peace with you, even
		if you're the father of lies. i
		want things to be as they were.

	louis perks up, puzzled.

				lestat
		stop pestering me then!

				claudia
		oh, lestat. i must do more than
		that. i've brought a present for
		you.

				lestat
		then i hope its a beautiful woman
		with endowments you will never
		possess.

	claudia stares at him for a moment.

				claudia
		better than that.

	she takes his hand and leads him into an inner room.
	louis follows behind.

				claudia
		you haven't fed enough. i can tell
		by your color.
