	ext. new orleans - night

	a big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.

	italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude
	commedia dell'arte on the stage.

	plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs
	watch the show as tavern wenches move about.

				louis (v.o.)
		this was new orleans, a magical and
		magnificent place to live. in which
		a vampire, richly dressed might
		attract no more notice in the
		evening than hundreds of other
		exotic creatures.

	louis and lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree.
	teresa, a tavern wench, sits on lestat's lap, pouring
	drinks for the two of them. she lifts a fresh glass to
	lestat's lips as he flirts with her.

				teresa
		come on, mon cher. the best in the
		colony. once you touch this you'll
		never go to any other tavern again.

				lestat
		you think so, cherie? but what if
		i'd rather taste your lips?

				teresa
		my lips are even sweeter still...

	she kisses him. he lets his tongue play with hers, then
	runs it down her neck. she swoons with pleasure. then
	he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking
	playfully behind at louis, who if appalled and
	fascinated.


	antics on the stage

	laughter rocks the tavern.

	lestat slips the pale and dead teresa into a chair
	beside him and folds her hands on the table. no one
	notices. he lays gold coins on the table and touches
	louis' knee.

				lestat
		let's get out of here!

	lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.
