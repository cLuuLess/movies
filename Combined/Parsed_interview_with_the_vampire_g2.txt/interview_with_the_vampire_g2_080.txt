	ext. carriage - night

	louis whipping the horses. claudia beside him. lestat's
	skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead
	youths.

				claudia
		in europe, louis. we shall meet our
		own kind. find the one who made
		him. learn what it means.

				louis
		and suppose the one who made him
		knows nothing and the vampire who
		made him knows nothing, and it goes
		back, nothing proceeding from
		nothing, until there is nothing!
		and we must live with the knowledge
		that there is no knowledge.
		
	the carriage pulls up by a swamp. mist everywhere.
	overhanging creepers.

				louis
		and if we find the one who made
		him? do we tell him we destroyed
		his own creation? the vampire
		lestat?

	louis drags out the bodies of the boys. he slides them
	into the waters of the swamp. we see ripples in the
	water and the churning of alligators, as they attack
	the corpses. louis takes lestat's skeleton in his arms.
	he slides it into the waters. the alligators speed
	towards it.

				claudia
		he belongs with those reptiles,
		louis. he deserved to die.

				louis
		then maybe so do we. every night of
		our lives. he was my brother. my
		maker. he gave me this life,
		whatever it is.

				claudia
		i did it for us, louis. so we could
		be free.

	he stands there, saying nothing.

				claudia
		louis, look at me.

				louis
			(bitterly)
		i can't. go away from me.

	claudia is shocked to her core. she steps back. louis
	stares at the rippling waters. gradually the movement
	of alligators stops. then he hears a sound he hasn't
	heard in years. soft, choking. he turns, sees claudia
	sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the
	first time in years. she is weeping copiously.

				louis
		claudia - you're crying -

	we see her face, tears of blood running down it. she is
	heartbroken, lost.

				claudia
		you never talked to me like that -
		in all these years.

				louis
		and you never cried -

				claudia
		i can't bear it when you do - i
		would die rather than lose you
		louis. i would die the way he died.

	louis gathers her in his arms.

				louis
		hush, claudia, hush now my dear -

				claudia
		tell me you don't hate me louis. i
		did it for you -

	louis walks her towards the carriage.

				louis
		i love you claudia. always. and we
		are free now, claudia. no lestat.
		just the two of us, beginning the
		great adventure of our lives.

	he lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving
	the silent waters of the swamp.
