	int. louvre - nights later

	it is already a museum by this time and louis and
	armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it.
	they stop by a gericault - the wreck of the medusa.

				louis
		you didn't even warm them, did you?

				armand
		no.

				louis
		and yet you knew what i would do.

				armand
		i knew. i rescued you, didn't i?
		from the terrible dawn.

				louis
		you were their leader. they trusted
		you.

				armand
		you made me see their failings,
		louis. you made me look at them
		with your eyes.

	he looks at louis affectionately.

				armand
		your melancholy eyes...

				louis
		what a pair we are. we deserve each
		other, don't we?

				armand
		we are a pair, and that's what
		counts.

	armand and louis walk slowly through the louvre
	together. camera follows them for a while, then comes
	to rest on a sunrise by turner.

				louis (v.o.)
		we left paris shortly after. for
		years we wandered. greece, egypt,
		all the ancient lands. then, out of
		curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who
		knows what, i took him home, to my
		america...
