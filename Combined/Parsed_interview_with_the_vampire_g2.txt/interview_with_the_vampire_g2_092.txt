	ext. street - shop window

	claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through
	the glass at a display of dolls. each doll in there
	seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
	she peers deep into the shop and sees -

	madeleine, a young woman bent over a workbench painting
	a doll's face, oblivious to being watched.
