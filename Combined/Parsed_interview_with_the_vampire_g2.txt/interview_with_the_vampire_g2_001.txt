	int. room - night (san francisco)

	a small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight
	coming through the window.

	a hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles
	with a small microphone.

	malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. he is
	young, half-shaven, dressed in t-shirt and jeans. he
	looks too -

	louis, who stands by the window, looking out on the
	street, with his back to malloy. louis is dressed in an
	old-fashioned suit.

				louis
		so you want me to tell you the
		story of my life...

				malloy
		that's what i do. i interview
		people. i collect lives. f.m.
		radio. f.f.r.c. i just interviewed
		a genuine hero, a cop who -

				louis
			(quietly interrupting)
		you'd have to have a lot of tape
		for my story. i've had a very
		unusual life.

				malloy
		so much the better. i've got a
		pocket full of tapes.

				louis
		you followed me here, didn't you?

				malloy
		saw you in the street outside. you
		seemed interesting. is this where
		you live?

				louis
		it's just a room...

				malloy
		so shall we begin?
			(playfully, almost
			teasing)
		what do you do?

				louis
		i'm a vampire.

	malloy laughs.

				malloy
		see? i knew you were interesting.
		you mean this literally, i take it?

				louis
		absolutely. i was watching you
		watching me. i was waiting for you
		in that alleyway. and then you
		began to speak.

				malloy
		well, what a lucky break for me.

				louis
		perhaps lucky for both of us.

	still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches
	the table.

				louis
		i'll tell you my story. all of it.
		i'd like to do that very much.

	malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure,
	fascinated but afraid.

				malloy
		you were going to kill me? drink my
		blood?

				louis
		yes but you needn't worry about
		that now. things change.

	louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. malloy is
	riveted.

				malloy
		you believe this, don't you? that
		you're a vampire? you really
		think...

				louis
		we can't begin this way. let me
		turn on the light.

				malloy
		but i thought vampires didn't like
		the light.

				louis
		we love it. i only wanted to
		prepare you.

	louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb.


	louis' face

	appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. inhuman or
	not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.

				malloy
		good god!

	he struggles to suppress fear and understand.

				louis
		don't be frightened. i want this
		opportunity.

	the light appears to go out by itself and suddenly
	louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light
	from the window. the cassette is turning.

				malloy
		how did you do that?

				louis
		the same way you do it. a series of
		simple gestures. only i moved too
		fast for you to see. i'm flesh and
		blood, you see. but not human. i
		haven't been human for two hundred
		years.

	malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.

				louis
		what can i do to put you at ease?
		shall we begin like david
		copperfield? i am born, i grow up.
		or shall we begin when i was born
		to darkness, as i call it. that's
		really where we should start, don't
		you think?

				malloy
		you're not lying to me, are you?

				louis
		why should i lie? 1791 was the year
		it happened. i was twenty-four -
		younger than you are now.

				malloy
		yes.

				louis
		but times were different then. i
		was a man at that age. the master
		of a large plantation just south of
		new orleans...
