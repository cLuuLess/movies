	int. slave-hut - night

	in a tiny cabin, a slave family. kids sleeping on the
	floor, in cribs and cots. the parents sleep on the bed,
	young, beautiful, naked. beside them is lestat, who is
	drinking the husband's blood, his hand playing across
	the breast of the wife as he does so. she murmurs in
	her sleep.

				wife
		yes... please...

	she grabs his fingers and kisses them, thinking him to
	be her husband. lestat gently disengages himself and
	leaves.
