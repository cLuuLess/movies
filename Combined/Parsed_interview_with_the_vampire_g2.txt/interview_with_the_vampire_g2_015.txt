	malloy stares at louis, terrified and enthralled.

				malloy

		crucifix...

				louis
		oh, that rumor about crosses?

				malloy
		you can't look at them...

				louis
		nonsense, my friend. i can look on
		anything i like. and i am
		particularly fond of looking on
		crucifixes.

				malloy

		heart?

				louis
		the same. as you would say today...
		bull shit.

				malloy

				louis

		are a necessity...
