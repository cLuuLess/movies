	int. dining room in mansion - night

	lestat and louis sit at the table, the untouched food
	between them.

				lestat
		consider yourself lucky. in paris a
		vampire has to be clever for many
		reasons. here all one needs is a
		pair of fangs.

				louis
		paris? you came from paris?

				lestat
		as did the one who made me.

				louis
		tell me about him. you must have
		learnt something from him! it had
		to happen for you as it did for me!

				lestat
		i learnt absolutely nothing. i
		wasn't give a choice, remember?

				louis
		but you must know something about
		the meaning of it all, you must
		know where we come from, why we...

	lestat spits out in anger.

				lestat
		why? why should i know these
		things? do you know them?

	the drumming grows outside.

				lestat
			(gripping his temples)
		that noise! it's driving me mad!
		we've been in the country for
		weeks, with nothing but that
		noise!!!

				louis
		they know about us. they see us
		dine on empty plates and drink from
		empty glasses.

				lestat
		come the new orleans then. there's
		an opera on tonight. a real french
		opera! we can dine in splendor!

				louis
		i respect life, don't you see? for
		each and every human life i have
		respect.

				lestat
		respect me a little then. i'm the
		only life you know.

	louis stares. lestat turns childishly, petulantly.

				lestat
		you'll soon run out of chickens,
		louis...

	he walks out, humming a french aria. louis stares at
	his plate.
