	int. medieval room

	medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one
	corner, a blazing fire. a medieval painting of satan,
	being banished from heaven, above the fire. armand
	places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.

				armand
		disappointing, isn't it? to come so
		far and find so little. jaded
		ingenues, amusing themselves with
		make- believe...

				louis
		we had feared we were the only
		ones...

				armand
		but how did you come into
		existence?

	he glances at louis, then at claudia, who averts her
	eyes.

				armand
		you don't want to answer... two
		vampires from the new world, come
		to guide us into the new era as all
		we love slowly rots and fades away.

				louis
		are you the leader of this group?

				armand
		if there were a leader, i would be
		the one.

	claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.

				louis
		so you have the answers...

				armand
		ah! you have questions?

				louis
		what are we?

				armand
		nothing if not vampires...

				louis
		who made us what we are?

				armand
		surely you know the one who made
		you...

				louis
		but the one who made him, who made
		the one who made him, the source of
		all this evil...

	louis looks at the picture. armand watches him.

				armand
		that is a picture, nothing more.

				louis
		you mean we are not children of
		satan?

				armand
		no.

	he smiles at louis. a smile of infinite compassion.

				armand
		i understand. i saw you in the
		theatre, your suffering, your
		sympathy for that girl. i saw you
		with the boy. you die when you
		kill, you feel you deserve to die
		and you stint on nothing. but does
		that make you evil? or, since you
		comprehend what you call goodness,
		does it not make you good?

				louis
		then there is nothing.

				armand
		perhaps...

	he passes his finger through the candle flame.

				armand
		and perhaps this is the only real
		evil left...

				louis
		then god does not exist...

				armand
		i have not spoken to him...

				louis
		and no vampire here has discourse
		with god or the devil?

				armand
		none that i've ever known. i know
		nothing of god or the devil, i have
		never seen a vision nor learnt a
		secret that would damn or save my
		soul. and as far as i know, after
		four hundred years i am the oldest
		living vampire in the world.

	he stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young.
	his eyes hold them both in a trance.

				louis
		my god... so it's as i always
		feared. nothing, leading to
		nothing.

				armand
		you fell too much. so much you make
		me feel...

	he stares from claudia to louis. he seems to be reading
	their souls.

				armand
		the one who made you should have
		told you this. the one who left the
		old world for the new...

				louis
		he knew nothing. he just didn't
		care.

				armand
		knew? you mean he is...

	claudia appears suddenly to louis' shoulder,
	interrupting.

				claudia
		come, beloved. it's time we were on
		our way. i'm hungry and the city
		waits.

	she stares hard at armand. armand looks from her to
	louis.

				armand
		so soon to go?

	he seems genuinely regretful. but claudia pulls louis
	out.
