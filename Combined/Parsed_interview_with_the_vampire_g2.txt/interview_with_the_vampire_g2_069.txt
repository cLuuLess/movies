	int. flat - night

	claudia playing the piano, now like a demonic liszt.
	louis writing.

	lestat appears in the doorway. he has a big box in his
	arms.

				claudia
		another doll? i have ten, you
		realize.

	focus on early 19th century french dolls - wood, glass,
	wax, bisque - all around the bedroom, on chairs, on the
	bed. some newish, some tattered old.

				lestat
		well, i thought you could use
		another.

	he hands her the box. it is a fine parisian jumeau
	doll. she likes it and stokes its face.

				claudia
		why always on this night?

				lestat
		what night? what do you mean?

				claudia
		you always give me the doll on the
		same night of the year.

				lestat
		i didn't realize.

				claudia
		is this my birthday?

	he examines the other dolls.

				lestat
		some of these are so old and
		tattered. you should throw them
		away.

				claudia
		i have. or there would be twice as
		many.

				lestat
		but you're the fairest by far.

				claudia
		you dress me like a doll. you make
		my hair like a doll. why?

	lestat doesn't answer. claudia stands up quickly, and
	strides out into the -


	parlour

	where louis is reading by the window. she walks to a
	mirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins
	cutting her hair.

				claudia
		you want me to be a doll forever?

				louis
		claudia - don't -

				claudia
		why not?

	she continues cutting. she sees lestat emerge from her
	bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an
	angelic little boy's face now with soft curls around
	her face.

				claudia
		can't i change, like everybody
		else?

	she walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the
	door.

	a beat. louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the
	floor to lestat. then a horrid scream pierces the
	silence. more screams, which become roars.
