	int. hotel rooms - night

	louis closes the door behind him. claudia paces.

				louis
		do you think i would let them harm
		you?

				claudia
		no, you would not, louis. danger
		hold you to me.

				louis
		love holds you to me. and we are in
		danger, not you.

				claudia
		love?

	she smiles at him. a strange, sad, adult smile.

				claudia
		you would leave me for armand if he
		beckoned you.

				louis
		never.

				claudia
		he wants you as you want him. he's
		been waiting for you. he wants you
		for a companion. he bides his time
		that place. he finds them as dull
		and lifeless as we do.

				louis
		that's not so.

				claudia
		do you know what his soul said to
		me without saying a word? when he
		put me in that trance...

				louis
		so you felt it too!

				claudia
		let him go, he said. let him go.

	she touches his face.

				claudia
		is that what i should do louis? let
		you go? my father? my lover? my
		louis, who made me?

	there are tears in her eyes. louis lifts her up in his
	arms.

				louis
		he can protect us, claudia.

				claudia
		you really believe that?
