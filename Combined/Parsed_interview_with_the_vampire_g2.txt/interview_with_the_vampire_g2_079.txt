	int. dining room - night

	two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a
	table full with a half-eaten meal. lestat sighs.

				lestat
		oh, claudia, you've outdone
		yourself. where did you find them?

				claudia
		drunk on brandy wine. a thimbleful.
		i thought of you when i saw them.

				lestat
		we forgive each other then?

	claudia stares at him, sitting. she nods.

	lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks
	greedily and horribly. claudia watches him without
	expression. he finished one, is about to take the other
	when he staggers. he looks at claudia.

				lestat
		absinthe? you gave them absinthe?

				claudia
		no. laudanum.

	lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her,
	then slips to the floor.

				lestat
		laudanum!

				claudia
		yes. it killed them, unfortunately.
		but it keeps the blood warm.

	lestat tries to rise.

				lestat
		ah louis, louis, she killed them...
		and let me drink...

	louis watches, appalled. he goes to move.

				claudia
		don't louis -

				lestat
		louis, put me in my coffin...

				claudia
		i'll put you in your coffin.
		forever.

	she pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks
	rapidly to him and slashes his throat. blood explodes
	from it.

				louis
		claudia! don't do this thing!!!

				lestat
		louis, louis, i gave you the gift -
		help me -

	claudia lacerates his face. blood pours from
	everywhere. she plunges the knife in his chest. he
	falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. claudia
	leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies.
	louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.

				louis
		what have you done, claudia -

	he drags her off lestat, tries to pull her out of the
	room. she hisses at him.

				claudia
		louis! look what's happening to
		him!!

	louis looks. the floor is a sea of blood. lestat has
	begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. his
	skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment,
	his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face.
	his lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. but his
	clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. it is
	no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of
	the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.

				louis
		lestat. oh, god forgive us.

				claudia
		don't mock me, louis. help me.

	she stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin
	wrapping. she is fascinated. she sees the vampiric
	blood flow all over the floor. she touches it and
	brings her finger to her lips.

				claudia
		goodnight, sweet prince, may
		flights of devils wing you to your
		rest.

	louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde
	hair.

				louis
		he's dead, claudia, dead.

				claudia
		the one good lesson he taught me,
		louis. never drink from the dead.

	she stands up, all business suddenly.

				claudia
		help me. we must get rid of him.

	she drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the
	crockery over the dead youths, and wraps lestat's
	skeleton in it. she takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and
	places them in his skeleton hands.

				claudia
		should we burn him? bury him? what
		would he have liked, louis?

				louis
		don't mock, claudia...

				claudia
		the swamp...
