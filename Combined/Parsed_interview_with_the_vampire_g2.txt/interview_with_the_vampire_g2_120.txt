	int. brick airwell

	on the stones lie claudia and madeleine, burn to ashes,
	in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and
	daughter in the new orleans graveyard, embracing each
	other.

	only claudia's blond hair and madeleine's red hair
	remain unburnt.

	louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many
	stories to the sky. he cries out in agony.

	santiago appears behind him, staring. louis roars in
	horror and attacks santiago, scattering the ashes into
	the rainy wind. claudia's golden locks fly up into the
	wind, they whirl around the warring figure.

	armand appears, drags louis free, pulls him screaming
	from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit.

	claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the
	airwell, towards the night sky.
