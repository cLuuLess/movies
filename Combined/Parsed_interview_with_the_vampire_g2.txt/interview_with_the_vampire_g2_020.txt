	int. dining room - night

	louis and lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled
	with uneaten food. lestat is going through sheafs of
	documents.

				louis (v.o.)
		i awoke the next evening to a
		different world. and i realized
		there are as profound differences
		between vampires as between human
		beings...

	lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.

				lestat
		your wealth, dear louis, is
		inestimable. your income from
		cotton alone will keep us in
		comfort for a century.

	louis just stares at him.

				louis (v.o.)
		i sat there staring at him with
		contempt. he had the soul of a
		shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear
		out of which nothing fine could be
		made. i felt sadly cheated in
		having him as a teacher...

	lestat looks up at him and grins.

				lestat
		you'll get used to killing. just
		forget about that mortal coil.
		you'll become accustomed to things
		all too quickly.

				louis
		do you think so?

	yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at lestat
	with loathing.

				yvette
		you are not hungry, sir...

				lestat
		au contraire, my dear. he could eat
		a horse...

	lestat laughs loudly. louis turns and looks at yvette.
	her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins
	pulsing on her neck and her hands.

				louis (v.o.)
		i looked at anything mortal and saw
		all life as precious, condemning
		all fruitless guilt and passion
		that would let it slip through the
		fingers like sand...

	yvette returns his stare, troubled.

				louis (v.o.)
		it was only as a vampire that i
		could see yvette's beauty. her fear
		of me increased my desire.

	yvette reaches for his uneaten plate. louis stops her
	hand. holds it for a beat too long, looking at the
	veins in her wrist.

				louis
		i will finish it, yvette. now leave
		us.

	she turns and runs from the table. lestat leans towards
	him.

				lestat
		can't you pretend, you fool? don't
		give the game away. we're lucky to
		have such a home.

	his hand snakes out under the table. it comes up
	holding a large grey rat.

				lestat
		pretend to drink, at least.

	he bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. he
	pours the blood into a crystal glass.

				lestat
		such fine crystal shouldn't go to
		waste...

	he hands the glass to louis. louis drinks the blood and
	stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the
	fine lace tablecloth.

				lestat
		i know. it gets cold so fast.

				louis
		we can live like this? off the
		blood of animals?

	lestat shrugs.

				lestat
		i wouldn't call it living. i'd call
		it surviving. a useful trick if
		you're caught for a month on a ship
		at sea.

	lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it
	sadly.

				lestat
		there's nothing in the world now
		that doesn't hold some...

				louis
		fascination...

				lestat
		yes. and i'm bored with this
		prattle -

	he throws the rat away.

				louis
		but we can live without taking
		human life. it's possible.

				lestat
		anything is possible. but just try
		it for a week. come into new
		orleans and let me show you some
		real sport!

	he rises. louis follows.
