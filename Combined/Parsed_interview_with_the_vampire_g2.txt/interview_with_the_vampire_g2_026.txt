	ext. lawns. night

	the widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her.
	louis is trying to quiet her.

				widow st clair
		my little papillions! my
		butterflies!!! he killed them!!!

	lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth
	and breaks her neck. he spits in fury at louis.

				lestat
		you whining coward of a vampire who
		prowls the night killing rats and
		poodles. you could have finished us
		both!
		
	louis throws himself on lestat with extraordinary
	force, pummeling him towards the trees.

				louis
		what have you done to me? you've
		condemned me to hell.

				lestat
		i don't know any hell -

	louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength
	he never knew he had.

				louis
		you want to see me kill? watch me
		kill you then -

	he drags him to the ground an throttles him. lestat
	looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.

				lestat
		what strength, my friend, what
		strength. i remember why i chose
		you now.

	lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.

				lestat
		but you can't kill me, louis. nor i
		you.

	he ruffles louis' hair, with wry affection.

				lestat
		feed on what you want, mon cherie.
		rats, chickens, doves, goats. i'll
		leave you to it and watch you come
		round. just remember, life without
		me would be even more unbearable...

	he smiles. a sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.
