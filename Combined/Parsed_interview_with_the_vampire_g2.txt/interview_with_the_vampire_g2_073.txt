	ext. streets - night

	louis, walking the streets, shivering.

				louis
		i walked all night. i walked as i
		walked years before when my mind
		swam with guilt at the thought of
		killing. i found myself at the
		cathedral.

	a cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open.

				louis
		i thought of all the things i had
		done and couldn't undo. and i
		longed for one second's peace...

	louis walks towards the doors, inside.
