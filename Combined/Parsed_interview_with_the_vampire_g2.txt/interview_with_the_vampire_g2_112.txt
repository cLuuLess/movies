	ext. hotel balcony - later

	louis on the balcony, weakened terribly. a breeze blows
	on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we
	see...

	silhouettes of madeleine and claudia. madeleine her
	arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain
	coming from her. claudia comes through the curtains,
	alarmed.

				claudia
			(whispers)
		louis!

	louis speaks without turning.

				louis
		she is dying. it happened to you
		too, but your child's mind can't
		remember.

				claudia
		but if she dies...

				louis
		it's only mortal death.

	he turns to look at claudia.

				louis
		bear me no ill will, my love. we
		are now even.

				claudia
		what do you mean?

				louis
		what died tonight inside that room
		was not that woman. it will take
		her many nights to die, perhaps
		years. what has died in that room
		tonight is the last vestige in me
		of what was human.

	she takes his hand.

				claudia
		yes father. at last. we are een.

	he bends down and kisses her. he looks up, at the
	wafting curtains. he sees -


	many vampire shadows

	silhouetted, coming closer.


	claudia

	looks up and screams.


	the curtains

	are ripped aside. the vampires of the theatre surge
	through.

				estelle
		time for justice, little one.

	the vampires close on them as louis struggles,
	claudia's scream pierces the night air.
