	ext. latin quarter - night

	louis walks briskly, head bowed.

				louis (v.o.)
		for a time we had been almost
		human, in the sensual whirl of what
		paris had to offer. but the human
		delights of that city only served
		to remind her of the ageless child
		she had become. i felt her pain as
		i walked until i become aware that
		i was being followed.


	closeup - louis' feet

	walking. a step echoes his.

	louis stops. turns, sees nothing. then walks again. the
	echoing steps begin again.

	louis again. sees a shadow, flitting.

				louis
		claudia!

	nothing. he walks again, hears the same effect. then he
	stops. he stares at a gaslamp opposite.

				louis (v.o.)
		so it was when i had given up the
		search for vampires that a vampire
		found me...

	santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the
	gaslight. and louis gradually realizes that this
	vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes
	and hair-style as louis.

	louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. santiago
	mimics. louis takes a step forwards. santiago mimics.
	louis folds his arms. santiago mimics.

				louis & statiago
			(simultaneously)
		clever.

				louis
		you mean me harm?

				santiago
			(a beat later)
		you mean me harm?

	louis calculates.

				louis
		trickster. buffoon!

	santiago echoes the first word, but not the second.
	louis has broken his composure. he turns his back on
	santiago, only to come face to face with santiago right
	in front of him.

	again louis turns this back to find santiago facing
	him.

	louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.

				louis
		i've searched the world for an
		immortal and this is what i find?

	slowly he looks up. santiago draws close, breaking the
	mirror trick and suddenly slams louis back against the
	wall.

	louis is furious. he regains his balance, strikes out
	at santiago and when santiago vanishes, to reappear
	behind him, louis slams back his elbow into his
	midriff. santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at
	louis, throwing him down.

	louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement
	sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. he looks
	both ways, then sees one has vanished. he stares,
	awestruck, at this new one:

				armand
		he looks like an angel.

				armand
		you are all right.

	he reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved
	invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at louis.

	louis reads it aloud, as we see:

	"theatre des vampires
	by special invitation
	friday, 9 p.m."

				armand
		bring the petit beauty with you. no
		one will harm you. i won't allow
		it. remember my name. armand.

	armand bows and vanishes.

	louis listens to the silence.


	ext boulevard des capuchines - theatre des vampires -
	night

	louis formally dressed with claudia in rich attire on
	his arm. they pass people buying tickets for the
	theatre and go inside.

				louis
		remember what i've told you.
		they'll have different powers.
		they'll read your thoughts if you
		allow it.

	they draw close to:


	huge posters

	reading -

	"theatre des vampires presents
	the masque of the red death
	by edgar allen poe"

	the posters are illustrated with cliched images of
	vampires overcoming damsels in distress.


	another angle

				claudia
		but this can't be real. this is
		nonsense.

				louis
		nonsense all right. but something
		tell me it's going to be the
		strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

	warily, they show their invitations to the mortal
	ticket taker at the door. he glances away
	indifferently.
