	ext. notre dame door - night

	louis is slumped against the stone wall. armand stands
	beside him like a guardian angel.

				armand
		i couldn't prevent it.

				louis
		i don't believe you. i do not have
		to read your soul to know that you
		lie.

				armand
		louis, they cannot be brought back.
		there are some things that are
		impossible, even for me.

				louis
		you let them do it.

	louis climbs to his feet.

				louis
		you held sway over them. they
		feared you. you wanted it to
		happen.

				armand
		louis, i swear i did not.

				louis
		i understand you only too well. you
		let them do it, as i let lestat
		turn a child into a demon. as i let
		her rip lestat's heart to pieces!
		well i am no longer that passive
		fool that has spun evil from evil
		till the web traps the one who made
		it. your melancholy spirit of this
		century! i know what i must do. and
		i warn you - you saved me tonight,
		so i return the favor - do not go
		near your cell in the theatre des
		vampires again.
