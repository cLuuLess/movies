	ext. dank new orleans back streets - night

	a rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another.
	louis' hand grabs the rat. we see him from behind,
	walking down the street, gripping one, then another.

				louis (v.o.)
		am i damned? am i from the devil?
		is my very nature that of a devil?
		and all the while, as these dreaded
		questions caused me to neglect my
		thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my
		veins were threads of pain in my
		flesh, my temples throbbed.

	a smaller side street, in which every house is marked
	with an x. the street is crawling with rats, and louis
	is following them. a man passes with a lantern.

				man
		don't go that way monsieur. it's
		the plague. go back the way you
		came.

	louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to
	himself.

				louis
		the way i came...

	he walks on, following the rats.

				louis (v.o.)
		... and finally, when i could stand
		it no longer, i stood in an empty
		desolate street and heard the sound
		of a child crying.

	a house, the door slightly open, marked with an x. the
	sound of a child crying inside. louis walks towards it.
