	ext. golden gate bridge - night

	malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge.
	he breathes deeply, to calm himself. he takes a tape
	from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks
	it in the deck.

		1791. that's when it happened. i
		was twenty-four. younger then you
		are now.

	suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat,
	pulls his neck backwards -


	lestat

	sinks his teeth in his neck.


	malloy's hands

	on the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.


	malloy's eyes

	bulging, as the life drains out of him. lestat sucking
	him like a rat.


	the wheel

	swinging free of malloy's dying hands.


	the car

	veers wildly into oncoming traffic.


	lestat

	drinks regardless.


	a truck

	coming towards them, about to crush the car.


	lestat's bony hand

	grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.


	the car

	misses the truck by inches.


	lestat

	throws malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.

	the tape is playing.

		my invitation was open to anyone.
		sailors, whores, thieves. but it
		was a vampire that accepted...


	on lestat

	at the wheel, the corpse of malloy in the passenger
	seat. he smiles. we can see the blood renewing him.

				lestat
		dear louis... will i ever forget?
