	int. armand's room - night

	armand opens the door to louis' knock.

				armand
		i was waiting for you...

				louis
		listen to me.

	he follows armand into the room.

				louis
		claudia is dear to me. my...
		daughter.

				armand
		your lover.

				louis
		no, my beloved, my child.

				armand
		if you say so. you are innocent.

				louis
		i'm not innocent. but i'm afraid.
		she feels she's in danger from the
		others.

				armand
		she is.

				louis
		but why?

				armand
		i could give you reasons. her
		silence. her youth. it's forbidden
		to make so young, so helpless, that
		cannot survive on its own.

				louis
		then blame the one who made her...

				armand
		did you kill this vampire who made
		you both? is that why you won't say
		his name? santiago thinks you did.

				louis
		we want no quarrel with him.

				armand
		it's already begun. if you want to
		save her, send her away.

				louis
		then i leave too.

	armand smiles.

				armand
		so soon? without any of those
		answers you so longed for?

				louis
		you said there were none.

				armand
		but you asked the wrong questions.
		do you know how few vampires have
		the stamina for immortality? how
		quickly they perish of their own
		will.

				louis
		we can do that?

				armand
		you would never give up life. if
		the world were reduced to one empty
		cell, on fragile candle, you stay
		alive and study it. you see too
		clearly. you see too much.

				louis
		that's what the one who made me
		said.

				armand
		how he must have loved you.

	armand suddenly grips louis close to him.

				armand
		louis, i need you more than he ever
		did. i need a link with this
		century. the world changes. we do
		not. therein lies the irony that
		ultimately kills us. i need you to
		make contact with this age.

	louis laughs bitterly.

				louis
		he? don't you see? i'm not the
		spirit of any age! i'm at odds with
		everything and always have been!
		i'm not even sure what i am!

	armand smiles.

				armand
		but louis, that is the very spirit
		of your age. the heart of it. you
		fall from grace has been the fall
		of a century.

	louis is stunned.

				louis
		and the vampires of the theatre?

				armand
		like moths around the candle of the
		age. decadent, useless. they can't
		reflect anything. but you do. you
		reflect its broken heart.

	louis is speechless.

				armand
		are these not the answers you came
		for?

				louis
			(softly)
		yes... my god...

				armand
		a vampire with a human soul. an
		immortal with a mortal's passion.
		you are beautiful, my friend.
		lestat must have wept when he made
		you -

				louis
		lestat! you knew lestat!

				armand
		yes i knew him. knew him well
		enough not to mourn his passing.

	armand stands. he takes louis by the arm, leads him
	towards the back wall.

				armand
		but you must go now. you must get
		her safely out of paris.

	he opens a hidden door in the wall.

				armand
		no-one else knows of this door.
		when you knock you will find me
		waiting...
