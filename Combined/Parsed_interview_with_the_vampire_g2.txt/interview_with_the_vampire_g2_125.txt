	int. stairs

	louis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of
	kerosene. he creeps quietly into the -


	ballroom

	leaking kerosene from the cask. he splashes over the
	coffins that gleam in the dimness.

	then he strikes a match and heaves it into the
	kerosene. everything bursts into flame. the trail of
	kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the
	coffins and up the stairs. we hear explosions of fire
	from above.


	louis

	shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. he
	readies the scythe, like the grim reaper.


	estelle

	rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run
	through the fire but louis slashes her down with the
	scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in
	flames.

				estelle
		stop him. it's morning. the
		sunlight. stop him.

	others rise, choking in the smoke. screams from
	everywhere. they are burning.

	louis backs up the stairs to the -


	dungeon

	he can see there a thin pale light under armand's
	bolted door. suddenly -


	santiago

	comes at him from behind. louis turns. santiago rushes
	him in a blur. louis swings the scythe, too fast to see
	what he himself is doing. santiago's head streaming
	blood flies through the air.

	the body drops, flapping its arms.

	screams come from everywhere.

	another vampire rushes burning towards louis. he
	decapitates him in turn. then he staggers into armand's
	cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom
	behind him. he staggers to the outer door. there is a
	thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him.
	he throws it open, and staggers into the daylight.
