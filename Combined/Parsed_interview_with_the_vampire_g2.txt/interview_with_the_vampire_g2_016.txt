	ext. mansion - night

	louis walks up the steps to the mansion. he looks now
	like a fully-fledged vampire. yvette, the slave girl
	stares at him from the open doorway. cascades of
	harpsichord music come from the interior.

				louis (v.o.)
		killing is no ordinary act. it is
		the experience of another's life
		for certain. that night i had lost
		my own life and taken another's. i
		was drowning in a sea of human
		guilt and regret, with all the
		heightened senses of a vampire...

	louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord
	music, as if in a dream. yvette draws back as he
	approaches.
