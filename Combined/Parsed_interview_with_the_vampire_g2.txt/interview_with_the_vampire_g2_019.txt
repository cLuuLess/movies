	int. basement - pointe du lac

	a brick walled storage room. two coffins stand on the
	floor. lestat enters with a lantern, louis behind.
	lestat is apprehensive and protective of louis. he
	pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.

				lestat
		you must get into it. it's the only
		safe place for you when the light
		comes.

				louis
		and if i don't?

				lestat
		the sun will destroy the blood i've
		given you. every tissue, every
		vein. the fire in this lantern
		could do that too.

	louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he
	peers into it.

				lestat
		don't be afraid. in moments you'll
		be sleeping as soundly as you ever
		slept. and when you awake i'll be
		waiting for you, and so will all
		the world.

	louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.

				louis
		you told me something earlier. you
		said you didn't have a choice. was
		that true?

	lestat smiles bitterly and nods.

				lestat
		someday i'll tell you. we have a
		lot of time to talk to each other.
		you might say... we have all the
		time we shall ever need.

	he closes the lid.

	total darkness. sounds of louis' panicked breathing. of
	his prayer again.

				louis
		dear god, what have i done?
