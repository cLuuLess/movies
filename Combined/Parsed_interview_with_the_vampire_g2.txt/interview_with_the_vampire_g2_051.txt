	int. sewer-pipe - evening

	louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems
	close to death. lestat comes through.

				lestat
		all i need to find you louis is
		follow the corpses of rats.

	he bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his
	own coat around him.

				lestat
		pain is terrible for you. you feel
		it like no other creature because
		you are a vampire. you don't want
		it to go on.

				louis
		no...

	they emerge from the sewer and walk along the
	waterfront.

				lestat
		do what it is in your nature to do.
		and you will feel as you felt with
		that child in your arms.

				louis
		oh god lestat. i felt peace. i felt
		an end to the craving.

				lestat
		that and more.

	he puts his arm around louis, to stop his shivering.

				lestat
		evil is a point of view. god kills,
		indiscriminately, and so shall we.
		for no creatures under god are as
		we are, none so like him as
		ourselves.

				louis
		is god merciless? greedy and cruel?

				lestat
		ah, but we have even more in common
		with our creator. come, i am like a
		mother tonight. i want a child.

	louis is baffled. he follows.
