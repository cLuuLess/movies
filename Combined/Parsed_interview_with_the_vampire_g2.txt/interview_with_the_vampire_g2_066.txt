	int. parlour - night

	claudia playing the piano, now with remarkable
	dexterity. the piano-teacher sits mute beside her. as
	she plays, he topples over and falls to the ground. we
	see the puncture-marks in his neck. lestat, hearing the
	noise, comes in.

				lestat
		claudia, claudia! didn't i tell
		you, never in the house!

	claudia smiles to herself, keeps playing.
