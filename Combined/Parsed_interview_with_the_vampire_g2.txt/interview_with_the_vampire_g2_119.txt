	int. coffin

	louis sleeps, upside down. sound of bricks being
	broken, thrown aside. then of locks breaking.

	louis opens his eyes. the lid opens. he sees -

				armand
		above him, reaching down to take
		his hand.

				armand
		hurry. don't make a sound.

	louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. louis runs
	to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.

				louis
		where is she? where's claudia?

				armand
		follow me - that way - through my
		cell -

	he points to his cell at the end of the passage, the
	foot of the steps. sound of rain beyond the door.

				louis
		not without claudia. where is she?

				armand
		i can't save her.

				louis
		you can't believe i'd leave without
		her. armand! you must save her! you
		have no choice.

				armand
		louis, i can't save her. i will
		only risk losing you -

	louis runs up the stone stairs. it leads to the
	ballroom. he enters.

	estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. she
	lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it.
	a male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at
	louis.

	silence. indifference.

	louis sees lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up
	to lestat, who looks up at him, confused. he's holding
	something crumpled, made of cloth.

				lestat
		you'll come home with me louis? for
		a little while... until i am myself
		again.

				louis
		claudia!!!

	louis turns round and round in rage. passive still
	faces. a door bangs open and shut.

	louis looks again at lestat. he snatches the cloth from
	lestat's hand. we see it is a small torn bloodstained
	dress. claudia's dress.

	the door bangs again. estelle laughs. rain gusts into
	the ballroom.

	louis goes to the door, holding the dress. armand
	approaches, trying to pull him away, but louis shrugs
	him off. he draws nearer and nearer and stairs at -
