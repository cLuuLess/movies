	ext. new orleans streets - night

	louis walking, holding claudia as if he was about to
	lose her.

				louis (v.o.)
		though everything was changed,
		through the years had warped the
		contours of the streets, i found my
		way there, aware that i'd always
		known where it was and avoided it,
		not wanting to pass the doorway
		where i'd first heard claudia cry.

	louis back in the same street, outside the same house.
	he stands with claudia at the window. there is a family
	inside, a picture of domestic tranquility.

				louis
		i heard you crying. you were there
		in a room with your mother. you
		were hugging her for warmth, crying
		pitifully as you had been for days.
		because your mother was dead...

	claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert.

				louis
		i opened the shutters... i came
		into the room... i felt pity for
		you. pity, but something else.

	he can't go on. claudia's eyes are remorseless.

				claudia
		you... fed on me?

				louis
		and he found me with you. i ran,
		sickened at what i'd done. then he
		cut his wrist and fed you from him.
		i tried to stop him, but you were a
		vampire then. and have been every
		night hereafter.

				claudia
		you both did it?

				louis
		i took your life. he gave you
		another one.

	claudia speaks through indrawn breath.

				claudia
		and here it is. and i hate you
		both.

	she runs.
