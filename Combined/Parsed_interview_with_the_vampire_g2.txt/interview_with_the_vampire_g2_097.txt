	int. sumpruous hotel suite

	full of late 19th century furniture, lots of empire
	style, regency, gilt, velvet and brocade.


	close on a huge black ebony chest

	against a wall, solemn among all the light and glitter.


	claudia

	by a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes. she is
	covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears.

				claudia
		help me, mon chere...

	louis walks over, helps her with the earrings.

				claudia
		how do i look?

				louis
		still my beautiful child.

	claudia laughs.

				claudia
		a beautiful child! is that what you
		still think i am?

				louis
		yes...

	he turns away.

				claudia
		why do you turn away? why don't you
		look.

	she twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then
	stops, stares at herself.

				claudia
		you want me to be your daughter
		forever, don't you?

				louis
		yes.

				claudia
		well tell me, papa. what was it
		like making love?

	louis is stunned. he blushes.

				claudia
		you don't remember? or you never
		knew.

				louis
		it was something hurries...and
		seldom savored... something acute
		that was quickly lost. it was the
		pale shadow of killing.

				claudia
		but how will i ever know, louis?

	she stares at him through the mirror.

				claudia
		i'll never find them, will i? my
		own kind...
