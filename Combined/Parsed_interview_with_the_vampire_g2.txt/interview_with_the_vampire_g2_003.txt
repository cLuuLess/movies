	int. waterfront tavern - night

	louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between
	two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. all
	around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black african
	freedmen.

				louis (v.o.)
		i wanted to lose everything. my
		wealth, my estate, my sanity. but
		lady luck didn't oblige.

	louis displays a hand of four aces. a gambler at the
	table stands in fury, over turning money, cards,
	drinks.

				louis
		you're calling me a cheat?

				gambler
		i'm calling you a piece of shit -

	the gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points
	it at louis. the crowd hushes and draws back. louis
	smiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace
	shirt, exposing his chest.

				louis
		then do me a favor. get rid of this
		piece of shit...

	the gambler's finger on the trigger. his hand shakes.

				louis
		you lack the courage of your
		convictions, sir. do it.

	lestat, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from
	beneath the shadow of his hood. gleaming blue eyes.

				louis (v.o.)
		most of all i longed for death. i
		know that now. i invited it, a
		release from the pain of living...

	the gambler lowers his gun, scowling. louis pockets the
	fistfulls of coins he has won.
