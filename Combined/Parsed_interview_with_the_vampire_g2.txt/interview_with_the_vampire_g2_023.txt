	int. french quarter mansion - ballroom

	small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig
	and garb prancing to a french minuet. young women sit
	in chairs along the walls with their chaperones. young
	men stand opposite.

		but the triumphant kill of lestat
		was a young man. they represented
		the greatest loss to lestat because
		they stood on the threshold of the
		maximum possibility of life.

	a youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against
	french windows. he is talking to an elegant widow,
	seated, holding two manicured poodles. lestat stares at
	the youth with longing.

				lestat
		the trick is not to think about it.
		see that one? the widow st. clair?
		she had that gorgeous young fop
		murder her husband. she's perfect
		for you. go ahead.

				louis
		but how do you know?

				lestat
		read her thoughts.

				louis
		i can't.

				lestat
		the dark gift is different for each
		of us. but one thing is true of
		everyone. we grow stronger as we go
		along.

	he leads louis closer to them.

				lestat
		take my word for it. she blamed a
		slave for his murder. and do you
		know what they did to him?

	he smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.

				lestat
		the evildoers are easier. and they
		taste better...
