	int. pointe du lac dining room - night

	louis, sitting in despair by the table. yvette, the
	slave girl enters.

				yvette
		michi louis? you don't want any
		supper?

	louis laughs harshly.

				louis
		no, ma cher. i need no supper. is
		all well at pointe du lac tonight?

	yvette draws closer. light reveals her beauty.

				yvette
		we worry about you master. when do
		you ride about the fields? how long
		since you've been to the slave
		quarters? everywhere there is
		death. animals, men. are you our
		master still at all?

	louis watches her sadly. he's getting hungry. her
	throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous.

				louis
			(dazed)
		leave me alone now, yvette.

				yvette
		i will not go unless you listen to
		me. send away this new friend of
		yours. the slaves are frightened of
		him. they are frightened of you.

	she comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart.
	she touches his hair. he takes her hand and brings it
	to his lips.

				louis
		i am frightened of myself, yvette.

	he kisses her wrist. she suddenly gasps, sharply,
	withdraws her hand. she sees her wrist is red with
	blood. she sees the blood on his lips. she screams.

	louis stands.

				louis
		hush, yvette -

	she screams even louder. louis clamps his hand over her
	mouth. her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing
	the empty glasses and crockery to the floor.

	in horror, louis realizes he has broken her neck. he
	brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it,
	revolted. he carries her body outside, grief-stricken.

	the drumming grows louder.
