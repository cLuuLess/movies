	ext. ship - night

	passing through the straits of gibralter.

				louis (v.o.)
		we reached the mediterranean. i
		wanted those waters to be blue.
		they were black, nighttime waters
		and how i suffered then, straining
		to remember the color that a young
		man's senses had taken for granted,
		that my memory had let slip away
		for eternity. it was black off the
		coast of italy, black off the coast
		of greece, europe itself was black.
