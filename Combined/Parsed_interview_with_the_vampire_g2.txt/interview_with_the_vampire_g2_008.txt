	int. lavish french-furnished bedroom at point du lac

	louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with
	mosquito netting. a female slave, yvette, bathes his
	face with a rag. she is crying. other slave women hover
	in the shadows. yvette puts out all candles save one by
	the bed, and withdraws, with the others.

	candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.

	louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring
	incoherently. then he opens his eyes.

	lestat, exquisitely dressed in french clothing, stands
	by the bed smiling. in the light of the candle we see
	that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright.
	lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible
	- and angel or monster.

	louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.

				louis
		who the hell are you? what are you
		doing in my house?

				lestat
		and a beautiful house it is too.
		yours is a good life, isn't it?

	louis takes aim. lestat puts his hand over the barrel.
	louis fires. the bullet tears a hole in lestat's hand.
	lestat is unfazed. he takes the gun from louis' hand
	and throws it away. his hand begins to heal.

				lestat
		you're not afraid of anything, are
		you?

				louis
		why should i be?

	louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and
	point it. lestat laughs indulgently. he draws closer.

				lestat
		are you going to put that through
		me too? ruin my beautiful clothes?

	he comes closer to louis, right up to his face, so the
	sword passes through his waistcoat.

				lestat
		were all last night's promises for
		nothing?

	he reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out
	the sword.

				louis
		what do you want from me?

				lestat
		i've come to answer your prayers.
		you want to die, don't you? life
		has no meaning anymore, does it?

	lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. louis
	is becoming spellbound.

				lestat
		the wine has no taste. the food
		sickens you. there seems no reason
		for any of it, does there? but what
		if i could give it back to you?
		pluck out the pain and give you
		another life? and it would be for
		all time? and sickness and death
		could never touch you again?

	the vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.
