	ext. square - night

	the tinkling of claudia's piano is heard, over -

	a well-dressed lady, walking through a square lit by
	gaslight. the lady hears a child's sobbing and stops,
	turns.


	pov

	claudia, the picture of lost innocence, sitting on a
	bench and crying.

				woman
		why are you crying, child?

	the woman, all solicitude, goes to claudia.

				woman

				claudia
		mama...

				woman
		hush now, don't cry, we'll find
		her...

				claudia
		mama...

	the woman takes claudia in her arms. claudia nestles
	her head in her shoulder, her teeth near her neck.
