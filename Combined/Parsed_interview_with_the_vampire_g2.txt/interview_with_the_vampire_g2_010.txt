	int. louis bedroom - night

	louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. lestat
	places a hand on his forehead and soothes him.

				lestat
		you have to ask me for this. you
		have to want it, do you hear me?

				louis
		give it to me!!!

				lestat
		vampires. we thrive on blood.

				louis
		i want it!

	lestat bends close as if to drink louis' blood. louis
	does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. lestat
	draws back, then stands up and goes to the french
	doors.

				lestat
		tomorrow night. you must prove
		yourself. i will give you the
		choice i never had.

	he looks outside.

				lestat
		the sun's coming up. watch it
		carefully. if you come with me
		tomorrow, you'll never see it
		again.

	he leaves. louis sits dazed, staring at the empty
	french window. the sun rises with unnatural beauty,
	over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the
	room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the
	picture of his dead wife.

				louis (v.o.)
		my last sunrise. that morning i was
		not yet a vampire, and i saw my
		last sunrise. i remember it
		completely, yet i don't remember
		any sunrise before it. i watched
		the whole magnificence of the dawn
		for the last time, as if it were
		the first. and the i said goodbye
		to sunlight and went out to become
		what i became.
