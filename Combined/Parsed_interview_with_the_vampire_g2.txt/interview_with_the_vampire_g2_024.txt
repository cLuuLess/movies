	lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. he
	looks back at louis, who holds both poodles on a
	delicate leash, walking with the widow. the minuet
	spills from the french windows.

				widow st. clair
		now, young man, you really amaze
		me! i'm old enough to be your
		grandmother.

	she leans towards him concquettishly. louis, crazed
	with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. he
	allows her lips reach his. he takes her in his arms,
	gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. she
	swoons.

				widow st. clair
		yes, that's the melody, i remember
		it. oh yes...

	louis draws his lips away. she is weak in his arms, but
	still alive. he can't do it. the poodles growl. he
	shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.
