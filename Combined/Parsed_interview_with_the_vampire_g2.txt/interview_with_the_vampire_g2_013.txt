	ext. cemetery - night

	louis stops again in front of the crypt. drinks from
	the flask, leans his forehead against the stone.

	lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.

				lestat
		you really want to be with them?

				louis
		yes. kill me. kill me like you
		promised -

				lestat
		you asked for death. i didn't
		promise it -

	in a quiet rage, lestat raise his fist and shatters the
	marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. his fist
	shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body
	of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable
	as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair,
	flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over
	it.

	louis gasps.

				lestat
		it's not your wife and child my
		friend. it's death. just that
		simple. think and choose. it
		happens to everyone. except us.

	lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy
	dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. louis again is
	spellbound. he drops the flask, which shatters on the
	stones.

	lestat appears angelic in his radiance.

				lestat
		we shall be this way always, my
		friend. young as we are now. i'm
		lonely for a companion, lonely for
		your strength. but i'm not that
		lonely. do you want to come or not?

	louis capitulates in one long sigh.

				louis
		yes...

	lestat comes closer, smiling.

				lestat
		did i hear a yes?

				louis
		yes...

	lestat embraces louis, obscuring his face. he drinks
	his blood. we hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming
	together. we see louis' face, growing paler, paler, as
	his blood is drained. his eyes stare upwards, losing
	their focus.


	louis' pov

	the moon, through hanging vines. the marble statue of
	his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. her
	hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the
	child's fingers reach out...


	back to scene

	lestat lets louis fall down beside the broken crypt.
	louis looks from the rotting bodies to lestat above
	him. radiant. lestat speaks gently.

				lestat
		i've drained you to the point of
		death. if you drink from me you
		live for ever. if i leave you here
		you die.

	lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows louis a
	kiss.

				louis
		no. don't leave me here. give it to
		me.

	lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. fangs
	slash his own flesh, blood falls.

				lestat
		you're sure?

				louis
		sure...

	louis rises to accept the first drops with his open
	mouth. lestat gathers him up, as louis clamps his hand
	on lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.

	the vampire theme swells.

	lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement.
	louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.


	louis' pov

	vampire vision. the world is transformed, the swamp,
	the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all
	come to him with unnatural clarity. he looks down with
	pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear
	beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. he closes
	the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground,
	astonished at the ease of it.

	he turns and stares at lestat whom he sees now with
	vampire's vision. lestat's eyes are brighter, his
	buttons are glimmering in the light. everything is
	clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and
	color.

				lestat
		stop staring at my buttons. didn't
		i tell you it was going to be fun?

	lestat leads him into the swamp. everything astonished
	louis, as if he's never seen it before. louis is
	suddenly racked by shudders of pain.

				lestat
		you're body's dying. pay no
		attention. it will take twenty
		minutes at most.

				louis
		dying?

	louis dry-retches.

				lestat
		it happens to us all.

	lestat wipes louis' brow.

				lestat
		come, you're going to feed now.

				louis
		i want a woman.

	lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in
	louis' ears.

				lestat
		that doesn't matter anymore, louis.
		you'll see. come...


	louis' vampire pov - swamp

	small high ground. camp of runaway slaves. several
	share a bottle of rum around the fire. a male slave
	rises. a gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and
	goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.

				lestat
		they're all beautiful now. men,
		women, the old, the young...simply
		because they are alive. -

	the slave walks towards them in the darkness. a
	crucifix gleams round his neck.

				lestat
		take him.

				louis
		the crucifix -

				lestat
		forget the crucifix. take him.

	louis hesitates.

				lestat
		resist no more louis. feed...

	the slave looks up and sees them. two gleaming white
	beings standing before him with devil's eyes. the he
	runs.

	louis can resist him no more. he swoops on him with a
	vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and
	sinks his teeth in his neck.

	close on louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent
	body shuddering in its death-throes. lestat stands
	above, laughing.

	the slave dies. louis rises from him, drunkenly,
	engorged with blood.

				louis
		what have i done?

				lestat
		you have fed. you were made for
		this...

	louis looks down at the body of the slave. lestat's
	laughter echoes around him.

				louis
		dear god, what have i done?

				lestat
		you've killed louis. and enjoyed
		it.

	lestat laughs harder. louis runs from him, screaming in
	anguish.
