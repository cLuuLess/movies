	int. inn - evening

	a lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy
	french furniture. open to rooftops of colonial city.
	louis sits by an open window looking out over the city.
	behind, we can hear the laughter of lestat and tow
	female voices. louis turns and sees -

	lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked
	whores. one runs her finger down his chest. the other
	seems out of it.

				whore #1
		you're skin's icy.

				lestat
		not always...

	he presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight,
	sinking his teeth into her neck. after a time she falls
	to the bed, dead. he turns to the other.

				lestat
		your friend has no head for wine.

				whore
		she's stupid. i can warm that cold
		skin of yours better than she can.

				lestat
		do you think so?

	he rubs her breast.

				whore
		why you're warm now.

				lestat
		ah, but the price is pretty high.
		your sweet friend - i exhausted
		her.

	he bites her in turn, drinks her blood. she does into
	the swoon.

	louis looks on in disgust. he stands.

				louis
		i'm leaving you. i can't stand this
		any longer.

	lestat pulls away from the whore.

				lestat
		what, no flowery speeches? about
		what a monster i am? what a vulgar
		fiend?

				louis
		i'm not interested in you. you
		disgust me. i'm interested in my
		own nature and know i can't trust
		you to tell me the truth about me.

				lestat
		what do you imagine you are louis?

				louis
		i don't pretend to know.

				lestat
		don't you understand, louis, that
		you alone of all creatures can see
		death with impunity... you alone
		under the rising moon can strike
		like the hand of god.

	the girl moans.

				louis
		lestat, she's alive!!!

				lestat
		vampires are killers. predators,
		who's all seeing eyes were meant to
		give them detachment.

	the girl moans again, open her eyes.

				louis
		the girl, lestat -

				lestat
		i know. let her alone.

	he slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood
	drip into a glass.

				lestat
		you think you can be human. you
		think you can go back. but you
		can't. you live off the blood of
		rats now louis. how human is that?

	the girls moans again. lestat drinks that glass.

				lestat
		lie still, love...

	the girl begins to scream. lestat picks her up.

				lestat
		you're tired love, you want to
		sleep.

	he walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the
	lid. we hear muffled screaming and banging from inside.

				louis
		why do you do this lestat?

				lestat
		i like to do it. i enjoy it. take
		you aesthete's taste to purer
		things. kill them swiftly if you
		will, but do it! for now doubt, you
		are a killer louis. ah!

	he stands up. the girl pushes the lid off, hysterical.
	she looks at louis.

				girl
		it's a coffin, a coffin! get me
		out!

				lestat
		of course it's a coffin. you're
		dead, love.

	louis screams at lestat

				louis
		lestat - finish this -

				lestat
		you finish her - if you feel so
		much -

	the girl grabs louis and pleads.

				girl
		you won't let me die, will you?
		you'll save me?

				lestat
		but it's too late, love. look at
		your wrist, you breast.

	he picks her up again. he turns to louis laughing.

				lestat
		unless i make her one of us...

				louis
		no!!!

				lestat
		then you kill her!!!!!

	the girl screams. louis puts his hands to his ears.
	then lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her
	neck. she dies at last.

	a terrible silence descends. lestat looks at louis.

				louis
		my god... to think you... are all i
		have to learn from...

				lestat
		in the old world, they called it
		the dark gift, louis. and i gave it
		to you.

	louis leaves without a word.
