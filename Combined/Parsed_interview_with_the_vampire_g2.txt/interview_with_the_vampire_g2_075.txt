	int. confessional

	louis, kneeling in the darkness. the hatch slides back.

				louis
		bless me father for i have sinned
		so often and so long, i don't know
		how to change nor beg for
		forgiveness.

				priest
		son, god is infinite in his
		capacity to forgive. tell him from
		your heart.

				louis
		murders, father, death after death.
		the woman who died two nights ago
		in jackson square, i killed her.
		and thousands of others before her.
		i have walked the streets of new
		orleans like the grim reaper. and
		fed on human life for my own. i am
		a vampire, father, and have turned
		the one i love most of all into on
		too -

	the hatch slams down. louis rises, confused, and the
	door is flung open, the priest stands there.

				priest
		do you know the meaning of
		sacrilege?

	louis rises. walks out.

				louis
		then there is no mercy.

	his face comes into the light. the priest steps back,
	open-mouthed.

				louis
		you talk of sacrilege. why if god
		exists does he suffer me to exist?

	he bares his fangs. the priest runs, screaming. gets to
	the bellrope, begins to ring the bell. louis swoops on
	him.

				louis
		why does he suffer me to live?

	louis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his
	feet stop kicking.
