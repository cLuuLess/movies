	int. room. san francisco - night

	the vampire sits in silence, as if tired by his story.
	malloy speaks, hesitantly.

				malloy
		you loved yvette...

				louis
		can a vampire feel love?

				malloy
		you loved your wife, surely.

				louis
		i was human then. might as well ask
		can an angel feel love. both are
		blesses or cursed with a certain...
		detachment. though whether angels
		take as long to learn it as i, i
		will never know.

	he looks directly at malloy, shocking him with his
	gaze.

				louis
		yes, i loved yvette. as i loved
		pointe du lac. and as with each
		thing i loved, i destroyed it.
