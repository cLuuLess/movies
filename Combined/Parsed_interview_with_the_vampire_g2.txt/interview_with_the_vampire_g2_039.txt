	ext. mansion - night

	fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins.
	the slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion
	steps. they see louis come out, holding the body of
	yvette. he is deranged with grief.

				louis
		this place is cursed. damned, do
		you hear me? and your master is the
		devil.

	he places the body of yvette in a rocking chair on the
	veranda.

				louis
		get out while you can. you're free
		men.

	they don't move. they stare at him blankly.

				louis
		unlike me, you are no free men...

	he turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all
	candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.

				louis
		do i have to convince you?

	he rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and
	sets fire to the drapes. he goes from window to window,
	lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.


	slaves pov - master

	setting fire to the house.

	they rush up the stairs with shouts of "stop him, he's
	mad". a wall of flame gushes out from the interior,
	blocking their way.
