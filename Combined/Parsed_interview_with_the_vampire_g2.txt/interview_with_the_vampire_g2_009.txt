	ext. graveyard - night

	the camera drifts through the graveyard where louis'
	wife is buring. everything is lit with an eerie glow,
	as if seen through some unearthly eye.

				lestat
		vampires, that's what we are.
		creatures of darkness, only we see
		it that darkness more clearly than
		any mortal has ever seen...

	louis and lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the
	overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and
	child. above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and
	child.

				lestat
		wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain
		goodbye? to wave away anguish and
		grief? to embrace the peace of the
		unending night?

	the marble fingers of the child on the statue move. the
	angel raises her head and has the face of louis wife,
	diane. she raises her hand and touches louis tear-
	streamed face. the child speaks.

				marble child
		papa...

	louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself
	touching cold marble. he cries out in anguish-

				louis
		diane!!!!

				lestat
		they are gone, louis. death took
		them. death which you can now
		destroy...

				louis
		no!!!!!
