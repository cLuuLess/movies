	ext. plantation - night

	lestat and louis walk through the slave quarters,
	huddles groups around fires, music, singing. the sound
	of whipping is heard.

				lestat
		your grief has unhinged you. you've
		let your estate rot.

	in the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is
	whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.

				lestat
		you let your overseer run riot,
		work your slaves to the bone. we'll
		start with him.

				louis
		how do you mean, start?

				lestat
		call him.

	louis calls.

				louis
		carlos!!!

	the overseer turns and comes towards them, with the
	bloodied whip.

				lestat
		why the bloody whip, carlos?

	the overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror,
	drops the whip and runs for the trees. lestat is on him
	in an instant. he sinks is teeth in his neck. louis
	runs to him, tries to pull him off. but lestat turns to
	louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.

				lestat
		let's call that a start.

				louis
		i can't do it.

				lestat
		you've just done it -

				louis
		kill me if you will, but i can't do
		this...

	he flees, as lestat ends to finish off the overseer.
