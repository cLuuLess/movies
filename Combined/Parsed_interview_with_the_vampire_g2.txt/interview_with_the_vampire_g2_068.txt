	ext. rue royale - night (1800's)

	street lamps are oil at this period. houses are now
	tall two-story spanish style. streets are flagstone.
	passing carriages are black.

		it was a very different life. and a
		new century was beginning. what had
		once been a small godforsaken
		french colony was growing into a
		great port, giving us an endless
		train of magnificent strangers...

	claudia, louis and lestat, dressed in the same clothes
	walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows.
	crowd milling around, sailors, whores, children,
	thieves, freed slaves, indians. they pass a wild west
	display, jugglers, fire-eaters, three-card
	tricksters...

				louis (v.o.)
		all human life was here, for the
		taking. and we took, all three of
		us, in our different ways...

	they come to a raised platform where a troupe of
	perfectly-formed midgets do a burlesque show.

	claudia stops. she stares, at these small, perfect
	creatures like herself, intrigued and troubled.

	louis and lestat walk on, not noticing as -


	claudia

	circles the troupe. she comes to a small tent, behind
	it. at the entrance stands a midget youth.

				youth
		you want to come inside, lovely?

	claudia walks up to him.

				youth
		ever been kissed?

	claudia shakes her head. he kisses her. claudia allow
	her to be kissed, then bites his tongue. he youth
	struggles, as claudia holds him and drains him. she
	lets him go as louis appears behind her.

				claudia
		she's like me, louis. small and yet
		not small at all. like me.

	louis hurriedly draws her away.

				louis (v.o.)
		i watched her grow yet stay the
		same, her doll-like face possessed
		of adult eyes, eerie, powerful,
		seductive...
