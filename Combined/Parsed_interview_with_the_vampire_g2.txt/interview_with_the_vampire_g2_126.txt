	ext. theatre des vampires - dawn

	louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the
	thin daylight. great gusts of smoke cover the street.
	he staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to
	fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -


	a magnificent hearse

	as in a dream, driven by armand's human boy. the door
	of the hearse opens. through the curtains enclosing the
	interior, we see armand. he reaches a hand out to louis
	and pulls him inside.

	the hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the
	spectacle of the burning theatre.
