	int. mansion - night

	louis wanders into the parlor, where lestat is playing
	the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. louis goes to
	a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there
	- quite the perfect vampire.

				lestat
		yes, that's you, my handsome
		friend. and you'll look that way
		till the stars fall from heaven.

				louis
		it can't be...

				lestat
		give it time. you're like a man who
		loses a limb and still imagines he
		feels pain. it will pass. and we
		must sleep now. i can feel the sun
		approaching.
