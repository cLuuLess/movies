	ext. wharf - night

	louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a
	wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. the
	pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to
	slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. he
	turns, and we see the face of lestat, who lifts him
	into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the
	whore screams and lestat's other hand clamps over her
	mouth. lestat drags her towards him. louis falls to the
	ground, supported no more, insensible. close on his
	face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,
	off.

				louis (v.o.)
		but it was a vampire that accepted.


	in the water

	the bodies of the thief and whore float by. above on
	the wharf, louis, now awake, stares down at them. he
	turns, to see lestat, towering above him.

				lestat
		they would have killed you -

				louis
		then my luck would have changed.

				lestat
		you want death? is it death you
		want?

				louis
		yes...

	lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the
	air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his
	teeth in his neck.


	on louis' face

	every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is
	drained from him.


	on their feet

	hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.

	the wind billows through the ghostly white sails and
	rigging of the boats around the wharf.


	lestat

	floats higher, with louis in his arms, draining his
	blood. one hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging
	from a shipmast. the other holds louis. he withdraws
	his teeth, and looks into louis' drained face.

				lestat
		you still want death? or have you
		tasted it enough?

	louis can barely get the words out.

				louis
		enough...

	lestat smiles and lets him go. louis falls and plummets
	into the water below.


	louis' face

	coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the
	wharf. the bodies of the whore and thief float beside
	him. he looks up and sees lestat way above him,
	dangling from the rope of the shipmast.
