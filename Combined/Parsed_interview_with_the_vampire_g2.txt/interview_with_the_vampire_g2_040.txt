	int. burning mansion - night

	louis, wandering from room to room of the burning
	mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the
	flames. he is weakening with the fumes, the heat. we
	can see this in his face, the texture of his skin.

	suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and
	lestat stands there, whip in hand. behind him we can
	see the morning sky.

				lestat
		you fool, what have you done?

				louis
		what you wouldn't do. it's almost
		sunrise. it will be the sun or the
		fire. you said they can kill me.
		the sun or the fire!

	louis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the
	floor. lestat darts forward and catches him before he
	drops. he runs out the shattered window, carrying him
	on his shoulder.
