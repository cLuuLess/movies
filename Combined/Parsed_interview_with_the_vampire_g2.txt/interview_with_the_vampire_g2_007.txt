	ext. waterfront - day

	louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,
	the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
	he gets to his feet and walks weakly through the
	mudflats. the sun is coming up over the sea behind him.

				louis (v.o.)
		he left me half dead that morning.
		he wanted something from me. he
		came back the following night.
