	int. claudia's bedroom

	she stands before the dressing-table, all her long hair
	grown back over her shoulders. she holds it with both
	hands, screaming and screaming. lestat and louis come
	through the door.

				claudia
		which of you did it? which of you
		made me the way i am?

				lestat
		what you are? you would be
		something other than you are?

				claudia
		and if i cut my hair again?

				lestat
		it will grow back again!

				claudia
		but it wasn't always so! i had a
		mother once! and louis - he had a
		wife! he was mortal the same as
		she! and so was i!

				louis
		claudia -

	she turns on lestat.

				claudia
		you made us what we are, didn't
		you?

				lestat
		stop her louis!

				claudia
		did you do it to me????

	she runs at him with the scissors, scoring his face.
	the cut heals. she scores it again. it heals again. she
	stares at him in horror.

				claudia
			(whispering)
		how did you do it?

				lestat
		and why should i tell you? it's in
		my power.

				claudia
		why yours alone? tell me how it was
		done!!!!

				lestat
		be glad i made you what you are!
		you'd be dead not if i hadn't.

	he storms out. louis goes to claudia and picks her up
	in his arms.

				louis
			(tenderly)
		we're immortal. you've always known
		that.

				claudia
		tell me why... you've got to tell
		me...

	louis carries her outside, onto the porch. there is an
	old flower-seller going by.

				louis
		you see the old woman? that will
		never happen to you. you'll never
		grow old. you will never die.

				claudia
		and it means something else too,
		doesn't it? i shall never, ever
		grow up.

	she clutches louis desperately.

				claudia
		i hate him. but i cannot bear to
		lose you. you're the only companion
		i have, forever. you taught me
		everything i know. please tell me
		louis. tell me how it came to be
		that i am this... thing...

	louis strokes her beautiful face, her hair.

				louis
		come... i've something to show
		you...
