	ext. new orleans street - night

	cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. louis
	emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.

				louis (v.o.)
		i had returned to new orleans. as
		soon as i smelt the air, i knew i
		was home. there was sadness there,
		rich, almost sweet, like the
		fragrance of jasmine. i walked the
		streets, savoring it like a long
		lost perfume...
