	ext. garden district - night

	louis walks past the many greek revival mansions.

				louis (v.o.)
		and then on prytania street, only
		blocks from the lafayette cemetery
		i caught the scent of death and it
		wasn't coming from the graves...

	camera pans over white-walled lafayette cemetery and
	its surrounding mansions.

				louis (v.o.)
		the scent grew stronger as i
		walked. old death. a scent too
		faint for mortals to detect.

	louis sees rats darting across the street. they rush
	into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined
	mansion. no lights.

	louis stops at a rusted gate. he forces it open and
	enters -


	a veritable jungle

	of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a
	faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass
	window of a huge greek revival house. he approaches
	then he sees -


	old shrivelled corpse

	of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny
	rosevines.


	louis

	looks around. walks on. sees another corpse, almost
	nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the
	roots of an oak overgrowing it.

	he looks up at the distant light.

	he passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
	vine, only bones and clothes.

				louis (v.o.)
		they were like the doomed princess
		caught in the thorny vines of
		sleeping beauty's castle. i knew
		what it meant. a vampire had lured
		them here, but had been to weak to
		get rid of them.

	louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.

				louis (v.o.)
		it spelt weakness, madness, the
		behavior of a dying animal that
		pollutes its own lair.

	louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves
	along the porch. more dead rats. he sees through the
	floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked
	books. virtually walled with them. water seeps down
	from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the
	books. the floors of the splendid rooms are bare,
	except for a rotten french chair by a dead fireplace. a
	single mirror reflecting the moon.

	dead rats.

	he moves along the porch to the parlor windows. the
	candle flickers inside. he sees -


	his pov

	lestat lying on the floor. he is gaunt to near
	starvation. all his scars are gone, but he is almost a
	skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
	his clothes are rags. blond hair beautiful, as always.


	malloy's entrances face superimposed over

				malloy (v.o.)
		lestat escaped the fire!

				louis (v.o.)
		he hadn't even been there. and all
		those years i thought he was dead.


	back to lestat

	one tiny candle stands beside him. he reads an early
	comic, from the turn of the century. without turning
	his head, he speaks.

				lestat
		i'm so glad you're here louis...
		i've dreamed of your coming...

				louis
		don't try to speak... it's
		alright...

				lestat
		i didn't mean to let them do it...
		that santiago, he tricked me...

				louis
		that's all past, lestat.

				lestat
		yes. past... she should never have
		been one of us...

	he turns and looks at louis. old, fearful, broken.

				lestat
		still beautiful louis. you always
		were the strong one.

				louis
		don't fear me, lestat. i bring you
		no harm.

				lestat
		you've come back to me, louis?
		you've come again to me?

	louis shakes his head. a series of police sirens go by,
	piercing the night sky. a helicopter goes overhead. red
	flashes illuminate his face. lestat shivers, covers his
	ears. he's terrified. louis touches him, calming him,
	until the lights pass over.

				louis
		it's only a siren...

				lestat
		i can't bear it louis! the machines
		out there, that fly and that roar!
		and such lights! they make the
		night brighter than the day!

				louis
		and they frighten you?

				lestat
		you know i love the dark. but
		there's no dark anymore.

				louis
		it's false light, lestat. it can't
		harm you...

				lestat
		if you stayed with me louis, i
		could venture out... little by
		little... become the old lestat.

	louis shivers. he releases him.

				louis
		i have to go now lestat...

				lestat
		you remember how i was, louis.. the
		vampire lestat...

				louis
		yes. i remember...

	lestat shivers.

				lestat
		i tried to tell you louis... that
		night in paris... when i first came
		to you... no-one can refuse the
		dark gift, louis... not even you.

				louis
		i tried...

				lestat
		and the more you tried, the more i
		wanted you... a vampire with your
		beautiful, suffering human heart.
		and how you suffered... i need your
		forgiveness, louis.

				louis
		you have it...

	louis walks slowly away from him. lestat turns back to
	his candle, his magazine.

				lestat
		you'll come back, louis... take me
		out... little by little... and
		maybe i'll be myself again...

	a bluebottle buzzes by him. his hand shoots out and
	grabs it, squeezes the blood.

				louis
			(whispering)
		yes, lestat...


	on louis

	as he walks through the decayed house. his eyes are
	expressionless.

				louis (v.o.)
		and my story ends there. but in
		fact it ended a long time ago, with
		claudia's ashes in that theatre. my
		love died with her. i never really
		changed after that. what became of
		lestat i have no idea. i go on,
		night after night. i feed on those
		who cross my path. but all my
		passion went with her yellow hair.
		i ma a spirit with preternatural
		flesh. detached. unchangeable.
		empty.
