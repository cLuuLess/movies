	int. flat - night

	louis enters, silently, like a corpse. he hears a voice
	behind him.

				claudia
		locked together in hatred -

	he turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. she is
	wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls,
	weirdly adult and seductive. she comes towards him.

				claudia
		but i can't hate you louis.

	she sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer.

				claudia
		is this the aroma of a mortal
		child?

	she whispers.

				claudia
		louis. lover.

	she kisses his cheek.

				claudia
		i was mortal to you. you gave me
		your immortal kiss. you became my
		mother and my father. and so i'm
		yours. forever.

	she takes his face in her hands.

				claudia
		but now's the time to end it,
		louis. now's the time to leave him.

				louis
		he'll never let us go.

	claudia smiles.

				claudia
		oh... really?
