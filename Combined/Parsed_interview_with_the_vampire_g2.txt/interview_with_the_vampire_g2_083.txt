	ext. deck of ship - near dawn

	louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the
	ship moves down the river. he sees...


	city of new orleans

	with flame lighting up the sky.

				louis (v.o.)
		though the fire seemed to spread
		through the quartier, i stood on
		that deck until dawn, fearful he
		would come out again of the very
		river like some monster to destroy
		us both. and all the while i
		thought, lestat, we deserve your
		vengeance. you gave me the dark
		gift. and i delivered you into the
		hands of death for the second time.
