	int. inn - supper room

	lestat enters.

				lestat
		she's here, your wounded one.

				louis
		what are you saying?

				lestat
		you need company, louis. more
		congenial than mine...

	lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four-
	poster bed. claudia lies there, angelic, under the
	coverlet, two marks on her neck.

				louis
		lestat!

				lestat
		you remember how you wanted her,
		the taste of her -

				louis
		i didn't want to kill her.

				lestat
		don't worry, louis, you're
		conscience is clear. you left her
		alive.

	lestat shakes her gently.

				lestat
		claudia, claudia, listen to me.
		you're ill, my precious and i'm
		going to give you what you need to
		get well.

				louis
		lestat, what do you mean?

	louis runs at him, but lestat brushes him aside
	effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. lestat bites
	his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's
	mouth... he winces in pain.

				lestat
		that's it dear. more. you must
		drink it to get well.

	claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little
	noises like a person waking from sleep.

	louis rises to his feet as claudia clutches lestat's
	arm, sucking the blood fiercely. lestat moans.

				lestat
		stop, that's enough. no more.

	he pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him
	with big clear astonished eyes.

				claudia
		i want more.

				louis
		what have you done?

	lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her,
	holding his wrist, obviously in pain.

				claudia
		more.

				lestat
		yes, cherie, of course you want
		more. and i'll show you how to get
		it. you drink from morals, my
		beauty, but from me? never again.

	still suffering, lestat pulls the bell-rope.


	close on claudia

	being transformed. becoming white yet robust, bright-
	eyed yet crazed. she shakes her beautiful curls and the
	dust falls from them. they are shining in the
	candlelight.

	louis cannot stop looking at her. he does not notices
	as -

	the maid enters.

				maid
		ah, quelle belle enfant!

	the maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of
	claudia. lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and
	claudia watches keenly.

				lestat
		gently, cherie. they are so
		innocent. they must not be made to
		suffer.

	claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck,
	locking on to the flowing blood.

	the maid is transfixed.

	close on louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror.

				louis
		you are the devil! you are the
		instrument of satan!

				lestat
		that's enough, cherie. stop before
		the heart stops.

	he lets the dead maid onto the floor. claudia looks at
	the corpse.

				claudia
		i want some more.

				lestat
		it's bet in the beginning, lest the
		death takes you down with it. yes,
		that's it. my child. my beloved
		child.

	lestat and claudia sit on the louis xvi settee. claudia
	is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. animated, voice
	crisp.

				claudia
		where is mamma?

	the words echo in louis' head, as he puts his hands to
	his ears.

				lestat
		mamma's gone to heaven, cherie,
		like that sweet lady over there.
		they all go to heaven. and you did
		very well, cherie. not a drop
		spilt. very good! you're going to
		be our child now.

	lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair.

				lestat
		your mama's left you with us. she
		wants you to be happy.

				louis
			(whispers)
		you are the devil! you are the
		instrument of satan!

				lestat
		shhhh! do you want to frighten our
		little daughter?

				claudia
		i'm not your daughter.

				lestat
		yes you are, my dearest. you are
		mine and louis' daughter. you see
		louis was going to leave us. he was
		going to go away. but now he's not.
		he's going to stay and make you
		happy.

	claudia runs over to him. she smiles at him.

				claudia
		lou...eee...

	louis is conflicted. he cannot leave her. he touches
	her cheeks, her hair. same as his. vampire skin and
	hair. he draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty,
	then he embraces her as a father might a daughter. he
	looks over her shoulder to lestat.

				louis
		you fiend. you monster.

	lestat smiles

				lestat
		one happy family.
