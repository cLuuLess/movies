	int. darkened corridors and theatre - night

	louis and claudia feel their way through darkened
	corridors, trying to find their way out.

				louis (v.o.)
		the place was dark as we left, a
		darkness that confounded even
		claudia. and as we blundered
		through it, again came the thought:
		i have wronged lestat, i have hated
		him for the wrong reasons.

	suddenly a light comes on. they see they are in the
	empty theatre. santiago stands on the stage, under a
	candle.

				santiago
		how did you wrong him?

	louis is stunned.

				louis
		you read my thoughts?

				santiago
		you said a name -

				louis
		a name i don't want to say again.

				santiago
		i seemed to recognize it...

	other vampires appear behind him.

				santiago
		there is but one crime among us
		vampires here.

	he looks at claudia.

				santiago
		you should know, who are so
		secretive about the vampire who
		made you.

	claudia laughs.

				claudia
		boredom!

				santiago
		it is the crime that means death to
		any vampire. to kill your own kind!

				claudia
		aaaah! i was so afraid it was to be
		born like venus out of the foam, as
		we were! come louis, let's go!
