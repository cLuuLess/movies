	int. corridor of theatre des vampires - night

	in a press of vampires, louis, claudia and madeleine
	are forced down the dark corridor. into -


	the ballroom

	vampire chaos, as they are dragged through. louis
	struggling like a demon.

				louis
		armand! get me armand! he wouldn't
		countenance this -

				santiago
		you can make no demands here!
		buffoon! bastard -

	santiago strikes louis to the ground. as he struggles
	to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure
	coming through. he gasps at the sight of -


	lestat

	dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the
	fire as well as the earlier stabbing. lestat is
	confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for santiago's
	shoulder to steady himself.

				lestat
		louis...

				santiago
		is he the one?

	lestat shakes his head.

				lestat
		no, the child. the child was the
		one...

				santiago
		all the murderers!!!

				louis
		you are alive, lestat! it can't be
		murder! tell them how you treated
		us...

	lestat reaches out to louis.

				lestat
		no... you come back to me louis...

				louis
		are you mad???

				estelle
		the sentence is death! to all of
		them!!!

				lestat
		only the girl - it was the girl -

	the sound of something being dragged through the crowd.
	horrible echoing, scraping -

	lestat grips santiago.

				lestat
		you promised me - i could take him
		back to new orleans - louis -
		there's something i must tell you -
		about that night - that night i met
		you -

	he stares around him, confused. the scraping gets
	louder.

				louis
		you let her go, lestat - you let
		her free - and i'll come back with
		you -

	santiago grabs louis by the neck.

				santiago
		death for the others. for you
		eternity in a box -

	we see now what caused the scraping. a huge metal
	coffin being dragged through the vampires. claudia
	screams.

				santiago
		walled in a dungeon. your only
		company will be your screams...
		perhaps it will take centuries...

	the vampires grab louis. they force him towards the
	coffin. lestat struggles with them.

				lestat
		he's coming home with me - you
		promised -

				santiago
			(laughing)
		we promised nothing!

	louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the
	coffin. claudia weeps.

				louis
		they've fooled you, lestat! you
		must reach armand! armand has the
		power!

	louis, struggling in the coffin. then the lid is forced
	down, huge locks closed over it.
