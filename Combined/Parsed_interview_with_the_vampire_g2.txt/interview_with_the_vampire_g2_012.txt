	ext. pointe du lac - night

	louis running up the steps leading to the gallery. he
	is crazed with guilt. he looks up and sees -


	lestat

	sitting collected at the head of the steps.


	louis

	backs away as lestat rises and descends the steps so
	fluidly he hardly seems to move.

				lestat
		don't worry. he was white trash,
		they come at two a penny. i dumped
		him in the swamp and untied the
		slave, licked his wounds clean.

				louis
		you're the devil, aren't you?
		that's who you are.

				lestat
			(gently)
		i wish i were. but if i were, what
		would i want with you?

				louis
		i can't go through with it, i tell
		you.

				lestat
		your perfect. your bitter and
		you're strong.

				louis
		but why do you want me?

				lestat
		because you're as strong as i was
		when i was alive.

	louis takes out his flask and drinks. drunkenly, he
	turns and heads for a nearby swamp.
