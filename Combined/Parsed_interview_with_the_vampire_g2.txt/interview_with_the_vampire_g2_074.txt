	int. cathedral - night

	louis enters. the dim lights of candles. a sacristan
	tending the altar, an old woman praying - otherwise
	empty.

				louis
		i had no fear. if anything i longed
		for something to happen, for the
		stones to tremble as i entered the
		foyer.

	louis walking down the nave of the church. he stops by
	the alter.

				louis
		i almost genuflected from old
		habit. i almost prayed.

	louis sits in a pew.

				louis
		and then it struck me.


	louis' pov

	the cross, the statues, the tabernacle.

				louis
		what if the statues gave an image
		to nothing? what if i was the
		supernatural in this cathedral? the
		only immortal under this roof. and
		i felt nothing but loneliness.
		loneliness to the point of madness.

	suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. louis almost
	jumps. he turns and sees the face of a grey-haired
	priest.

				priest
		you wish to go to confession? i was
		about to lock up the church.

	louis stares at him, tears in his eyes.

				priest
		you are troubled, aren't you? can i
		help?

				louis
		it's too late, too late -

				preist
		no, it's never too late. come...

	the priest gestures to the confessional. louis rises,
	slowly.
