	int. room. san francisco - night (present)

	malloy, staring at louis.

				malloy
		no... it can't end like that...

				louis
		but it has. there is no more to
		tell.

				malloy
		but you talk about passion, about
		longing, about things i'll never
		know in my life! it's still inside
		you, in every syllable you speak!
		and then you tell me it ends like
		that? just empty?

				louis
		it's over, i'm telling you...

				malloy
		you need a new passion, louis, a
		new reason to feel... what a story
		you've told, you don't understand
		yourself.

	louis looks at the cassettes on the table.

				louis
		do what you want with it. learn
		what you can. give the story to
		others.

	malloy rises.

				malloy
		you have another chance, louis.
		take me! give me your gift, your
		power...

	louis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry.

				louis
		is this what you want? you ask me
		for this after all i've told you?

				malloy
		if i could see what you've seen,
		feel what you've felt i wouldn't
		let it end like this! you need a
		like to the world out there, a
		connection... then it won't end
		like this...

	he stares at louis.

				malloy
		you need me.

	louis turns away.

				louis
		dear god. i've failed again,
		haven't i?

				malloy
		no...

				louis
		don't say anymore. the reels are
		still turning. i have but one
		chance to show you the meaning of
		what i've said.

	he looks at the boy. then suddenly grabs him, lifts him
	off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings
	them to his throat. malloy screams, in involuntary
	terror.

				louis
		you like it? you like being food
		for the immortals? you like dying?
		is it beautiful? is it intense?

	malloy, now terrified, whispers

				malloy
		no... please...

	louis drops him.

				louis
		thank god.

	malloy, falls on the floor, terrified. when he looks
	up, louis has vanished.

				malloy
		louis... louis...

	he looks up at the tape. it is still turning.

				malloy
		holy shit...

	he shakes his head. he gets up, and with shaking
	fingers gathers his tapes. he runs out of the room.
