	int. theatre box - night

	claudia and louis look at the crowd as the lights go
	down.

				claudia
		mortals, mortals everywhere. and
		lots of drops to drink.

				louis
		they are here. i know they are.
		listen for something that doesn't
		make a sound.

	stage: curtain rises.

	an elaborate painted set of an italianate castle. death
	standing before it, the traditional image of the grim
	reaper, complete with magnificent scythe.

				louis
			(whispers)
		it's a vampire. it's the one i saw
		in rue st jacques.

	a version of the poe story unfolds before them. all of
	the participants are vampires. all beautiful gleaming
	white, aged 20 or 30.

				louis
		they use no paint. and the audience
		think it is paint.

				claudia
		how devilishly clever.

	a spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out
	upon the stage.

				claudia
		she's no vampire.

				louis
		no. she's frightened. she doesn't
		know where she is.

	the audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the mortal
	woman comes into the footlights. she is too beautiful,
	too confused. santiago, as death, advances on her. she
	backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in
	a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.

				mortal woman
		i don't want to die!

	she looks around in panic. santiago swoons, arms over
	his breast as if he is hopelessly in love.

				santiago
		we are death!

	the mortal woman steps to the footlights.

				mortal woman
		someone help me. please... what
		have i done?

	louis whispers to claudia.

				louis
		this is no performance.

				claudia
		and no one knows but us...


	on the stage

				santiago
		we all die. death is the one thing
		you share with all those here.

	santiago gestures to the audience.


	audience

	rapt faces.


	on the stage

				mortal woman
		but i'm young...

				santiago
		death is no respecter of age. he
		can come any time, any place. need
		i tell you what fate has in store
		for you?

				mortal woman
		i would take my chance. let me go!
		please...

				santiago
		and if you take that chance and
		live, what is your fate? the
		humpbacked toothless visage of old
		age?

	santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of
	her peasant blouse. it opens completely and starts to
	slip. she tries to catch it, but gently stops her
	wrists. the blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.


	louis and claudia

				louis
		this is monstrous!

				claudia
		yes, and very beautiful.


	on the stage

				santiago
		just as this flesh is pink now, it
		will turn grey and wrinkle with
		age.

				mortal woman
		let me live, please. i don't care.

				santiago
		then why should you care if you die
		now?

	she shakes her head, confused. he catches her wrists
	behind her back.


	audience

	is awestruck by her beauty, her suffering.


	santiago

	draws near her cheek.

				santiago
		and suppose death had a heart to
		love and to release you? to whom
		would he turn his passion? would
		you pick a person from the crowd
		there? a person to suffer as you
		suffer?


	audience

	a young girl cries out in jest.

				young girl
		oh, yes, take me monsieur vampire!
		i adore you!

	audience roars with laughter.


	on the stage

				santiago
		you wait your turn.

	the audience laughs again.

	the mortal woman shakes her head in panic.

				santiago
		well, have you a sister, a mother,
		a daughter you would send in your
		place?


	close on claudia

	even she is repelled by the cruelty. she shakes her
	head.


	mortal woman

	shakes her head. she is helpless.

				santiago
		we alone can give death meaning. do
		you know what it means to be loved
		by death, to become our bride?

	mortal woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or
	fainting. but then her eyes mist over. she is being
	entranced.


	from her pov

	we realize she is looking past santiago at the divinely
	beautiful armand, who has just stepped out of the
	wings. armand has entranced her. he passes santiago.
	santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.

				armand
		no pain.

				mortal woman
		no pain?

	armand takes her by the naked shoulders.

				armand
		your beauty is a gift to us.


	on the stage

	armand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully
	close in.

				armand
		who deserves such a gift?

	he pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls
	revealing her nakedness. but she is spellbound.

				mortal woman
		no pain...

	armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark
	against her black clothes, then he passes her to the
	other vampires one by one.


	close on louis

	who battles desire and hunger with anger.

				louis
		i've seen enough of this! i loathe
		it!

				claudia
		be still!


	on the stage

	the naked mortal woman lies dead on the floor. the
	vampires seem to vanish one by one. as the curtain
	draws across, the audience loudly applauds what they
	presume are theatrical tricks.


	another angle

	the audience, milling towards the exits. they talk in
	vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the
	symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave.

	gradually louis and claudia are left alone in the empty
	theatre. louis seems anxious to leave. claudia whispers
	in his ear.

				claudia
		patience, louis. patience.

	he looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than
	when the play was on. the red curtain shifts slightly
	in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a
	box. then the candle flares again, and we see armand in
	the box, looking down on them. he stares with a dreamy
	expression, saying nothing.

				louis
		we've been searching for you for a
		very long time...

	his voice echoes eerily. armand gestures for them to
	follow him.
