	int. movie theatre - night

	a deco cinema of the twenties. louis and armand,
	dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle
	through the crowded seats.

				louis (v.o.)
		and there, a technological wonder
		allowed me see sunrise, for the
		first time in two hundred years...

	on the screen, murnau's "sunrise", in black and white.
	we see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of
	movies, in black and white.

				louis (v.o.)
		and what sunrises! seen as the
		human eye could never see them. we
		would sit in the dark, night after
		night among nameless humans,
		entranced with the miracle of
		light. silver at first, then as the
		years progressed in tones of
		purple, red and my long-lost
		blue...

	the sunrises continue, in color now, and the
	backgrounds in them change to the fifties.

				louis (v.o.)
		and in time parted. we had become
		so alike, we both wanted the
		certainties of loneliness once
		more.

	the lights come up in a different theatre. louis
	sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed
	in the clothes of the fifties. he rises, exits with the
	others.
