	ext. louisiana - day (1791)

	a disheveled louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket
	frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of
	indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.

	he passes slave quarters and the distant colonial
	mansion of pointe du lac.

	he comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he
	dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate
	one in greek style.

				louis (v.o.)
		i had just lost my wife in
		childbirth. she and the infant had
		been buried less than half a year.

	there is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with
	a tiny cherub angel in her arms. louis looks from the
	angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:

	"dianne de pointe du lac 1763 - 1791
	infant jean marie - 1791"

	louis rips away the vines already covering the
	inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. his face
	is ashen.

				louis (v.o.)
		i was twenty-four and life seemed
		finished. i couldn't bear the pain
		of their loss. i longed for a
		release from it.
