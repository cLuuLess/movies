ext. culvert, vale of morgul - dawn

angle on: a grim landscape, covered in thorn bushes and the
scars of recent fires. the dark morgul valley disappears up
towards the mountains.

settle on: frodo and sam in a filthy culvert.
sam twitches in a restless sleep. but frodo is awake . . . his
hand trails down to the chain around his neck ...

a sudden hiss! frodo quickly hides the ring as gollum peers
at them with gleaming eyes.

                        gollum
             wake up! wake up! wake up, sleepies! we
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

sam stirs, looks at frodo . . .

                        sam
             haven't you had any sleep, mr frodo?

frodo shakes his head.

                        sam (cont'd)
             i've gone and had too much!


                                                        (continued)

sam looks at the dead, brown twilight, below the lowering
cloud.

                        sam (cont'd)
             it must be getting late.

                        frodo
             no . . . no it isn't. it isn't midday yet.
             the days are growing darker.

the ground suddenly quivers, as a rolling, rumbling noise
echoes down the valley.

                        gollum
             come on, must go, no time ...

                        sam
             not before mr frodo's had something to eat.

                        gollum
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

sam shoots gollum a hostile look and turns back to rummage in
his knapsack. he holds up a piece of dried lembas bread to
frodo.

                        sam
             here.

                        frodo
             what about you?

                        sam
                  (lying badly)
             i'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

                        frodo
             sam.

                        sam
                  (confessing)
             alright. we don't have that much left.
                         (more)


                                                          (continued)

                      sam (cont'd)
            we have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. you go ahead and eat that, mr frodo.
            i've rationed it. there should be enough.

frodo looksa t sam questioningly.

                        frodo
            for what?

                       sam
            the journey home.

frodo says nothing.                                            .
