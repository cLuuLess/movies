ext. minas tirith streets - day

angle on: faramir leading a column of 200 knights through the
streets towards the city gate ... people are rushing forward,
throwing flowers over the knights.

close on: gandalf hurries alongside faramir's horse.

                    gandalf
          faramir! your father's will has turned to
          madness! do not throw away your life so
          rashly!

                     faramir
               (deadened)
          where does my allegiance lie if not here?

gandalf reads the pain in faramir's eyes . . . he calls after
him, trying one more time to stop the young man.

                     gandalf
          your father loves you, faramir!
               (quietly)
          and will remember it before the end.
