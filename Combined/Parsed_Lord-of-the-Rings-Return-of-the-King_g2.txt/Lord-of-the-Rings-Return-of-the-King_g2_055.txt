angle on: faramir and his men are fighting a losing battle
against the mordor invasion.

                        madril
             we can't hold them. the city is lost!

                       faramir
             tell the men to break up. we ride for minas
             tirith.

on the soundtrack: ominous sounds of wind rising ... huge
wings beating ...

                       ranger
             nazgul!

spinning angle: faramir looks up at the sky . . . ithilien
rangers are suddenly nervous, frightened . . . a huge shadow
passes overhead!

                       faramir
             take cover!

a sudden terrifying shriek rends the air!

                       faramir (cont'd)
             pull back! pull back to minas tirith!

angle on: soldiers retreating through the ruins of the city
as, high in the sky above, the nazgul swoop ...

angle on: madril as he is cut down by an orc . . .

close on: madril . . . his breathing quick and shallow . . .
footsteps approach . . .

angle on: the hideously deformed features of gothmog standing
over the prone figure of the injured ranger.

grabbing a spear from a nearby underling, gothmog drives the
shaft into madril's chest . . .

close on: gothmog surveys the carnage with satisfaction.

                      gothmog
           the age of men is over. the time of the ore
           has come.
