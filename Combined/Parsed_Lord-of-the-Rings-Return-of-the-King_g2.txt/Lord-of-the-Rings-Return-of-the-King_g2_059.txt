ext. cirith ungol stairs - night

angle on: frodo and sam following gollum up the dizzying
stairway, carved into the sheer cliff.

the steps are narrow, unevenly spaced, and many are broken.
they are so steep that frodo and sam climb as if on a ladder Â·
their desperate fingers clinging to the steps above - trying
not to look at the long black fall below them.

angle on: frodo's foot slips and for a brief moment he is
hanging precariously from the rock-face.

                      gollum
            careful, master - careful! very far to
            fall. very dangerous on the stairs.
