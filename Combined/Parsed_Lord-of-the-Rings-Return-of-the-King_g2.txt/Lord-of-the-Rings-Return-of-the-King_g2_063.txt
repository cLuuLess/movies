close on: pippin . . . dressed in over-sized armour . . . kneels
before denethor . . .

                        pippin
                  (nervous)
             here do i swear fealty and service to
             gondor, in peace or war, in living or
             dying, from this hour henceforth, until my
             lord release me, or death take me.

                        denethor
             and i shall not forget it, nor fail to
             reward that which is given ...

angle on: denethor proffers his ring which pippin kisses . . .

                       denethor (cont'd)
             ... fealty with love ...

denethor gently raises pippin's head . . . denethor's eyes meet
faramir' s.

                       denethor (cont'd)
             ... valour with honour ...
                                                         (continued)

continued:


denethor crosses to a table ... attendants begin serving him
a me l . . .
    a

                       denethor (cont'd)

             ... disloyalty with vengeance.

denethor addresses his meal . . .

                        denethor (cont'd)
                  (reasonable)
             i do not think we should so lightly abandon
             the outer defences; defences that your
             brother long held intact.

                        faramir
             what would you have me do?

                       denethor
             i will not yield the river and pelennor
             unfought - osgiliath must be retaken.

                        faramir
             my lord, osgiliath is overrun.

                        denethor
             much must be risked in war. is there a
             captain here who still has the courage to
             do his lord's will?

close on: faramir as he finally realises the truth.



                        faramir
                  (quietly)
             you wish now that our places had been
             exchanged, that i had died and boromir had
             lived?

close on: for a brief second, denethor seems to hesitate,
then ...




                                                         (continued)

                        denethor
                 (coldly)
            yes, i wish that.

                       faramir
            since you are robbed of boromir, i will do
            what i can in his stead.

angle on: faramir bows low to denethor, then turns to leave,
stops, turns back ...

                       faramir (cont'd)
            if i should return ... think better of me,.
            father.

                       denethor
            that will depend on the manner of your
            return.

denethor continues with his meal. faramir exits.
