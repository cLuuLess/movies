                 the cop comes out with his hands up.

                                 cop

                       "whaddya want with me?"

                               gregory

"i dont know. i just thought id find out what you wanted without you
                shooting at me. so, what do you want?"

the cop is a tough one. far taller than gregory, muscular and serious.

                                 cop

                      "youre all under arrest."

the pack explodes with laughter. gregory walks up to the policeman and
circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction.

                               gregory

 "this is your lucky day, officer. were gonna give you a night off."

chandra walks up to him. seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard
liquour.

                               chandra

                               "drink."

when  he  pauses,   gregory  places  the   gun  against  his   temple.
reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol.

gregory lowers the gun. he and chandra return to their motorcycle.

                               gregory

                    "you never even saw us, man."

                               chandra

                          "keep the bottle."

they start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows  of
the road.

                                                               cut to:
