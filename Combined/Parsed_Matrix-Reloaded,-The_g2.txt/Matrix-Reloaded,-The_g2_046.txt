int. morpheus cabin

its dark, but  quiet classical music  can be heard.  hes not in  bed
alone. niobes shaded form can be made out behind him.

morpheus sounds awake,  but looks anything  but. he grabs  the buzzing
handset only an arms length from him.

                               morpheus

                             "im here."

                                razor

                   "sir, you gotta get down here."

morpheus starts  dressing as  he talks.  he puts  a reasurring hand on
niobes shoulder.

                               morpheus

                          "proximity alarm?"

                                razor

             "the matrix, sir. the coding is going nuts."

                               morpheus

                          "be right there."

morpheus hangs  up the  phone and  jumps into  his boots.  he turns to
niobe as he works.

                               morpheus

    "it sounds bad. theyre readjusting quicker than we thought."

                 niobe jumps up and dresses quickly.

                                niobe

                              "already?"

                               morpheus

          "it appears that they are learning their lessons."

                        niobe shakes her head.

           "morpheus, how much are you going to tell him?"

                           morpheus pauses.

                               morpheus

            "tell neo? about his predecessors, i suppose?"

                        niobe, dressed, nods.

                               morpheus

                           "he is the -"

                   niobe puts a finger to his lips.

                                niobe

                   "six came before him, morpheus."

                   morpheus shakes his head slowly.

                               morpheus

"to me, none came before him. the oracle told me i would find the one.
          it is prophecy. you havent seen what he can do."

                                niobe

       "what if they toughen the matrix code, like last time?"

                               morpheus

 "there are lots of ifs. how about this one: what if we lose faith in
                             our cause?"

  he disappears through the door, leaving niobe standing in the dim
                                light.
