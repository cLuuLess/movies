they smell somethings wrong. they  move, back to back in  a triangle,
for the  phone booth,  weapons draw  and looking  in all  direction at

                               morpheus

                         "niobe, you first."

                               trinity

                      "bullshit, its my turn."

                                niobe

                     "junior ranks leave first."

trinity enters the booth as the phone starts ringing.

he bursts  out of  the door,  gun firing  at the  booth. inside, glass
shatters, and blood sprays as  trinity is riddled with bullets.  smith
doesnt stop. he sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses,
phone still ringing. her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth
door as it shuts from her weight.
