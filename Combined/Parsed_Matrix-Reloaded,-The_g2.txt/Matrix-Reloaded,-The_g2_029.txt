we look  through the  windshield as  the cop  drives down the highway,
calling in his  stop-vehicle report. he  suddenly sees something  that
makes him slam on the brakes.

                                 cop

                             "holy shit!"

angle through the  copÂ’s windshield. the  ten bikers, with  gregory at
their center, are  parked in the  middle of the  road, looking at  him
casually."
