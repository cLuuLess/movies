gregory  and  chandra  lie  on  the  blanket,  staring  at  the   sky.
inexplicably, gregroy holds a hand toward the sky.

                               gregory

                       "which one do you want?"

                               chandra

                    "any one. it doesnt matter."

with his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts  glowing
stronger  and stronger.  it vibrates,  then fades  suddenly and  comes
loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky.

        chandra draws closer to him, enraptured by his power.

                               chandra

                     "how do you do it, gregory?"

                               gregory

   "i dont know. sometimes it feels like... im reaching beyond the
                               world."

his hand drops and his head turns. he sits up, startled by something.

                               chandra

                            "what is it?"

            gregory holds up a hand for her to be silent.

                               gregory

                 "they found us. cant you hear it?"

                               chandra

                    "what? i dont hear anything."

                               gregory

  "we can only rebel so long. we can only push until they will hit
                                back."

                               chandra

                     "they? the men in black?"

cu on gregory. in the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can
                      be heard, growing louder.

                               gregory

                      "fuck! get to the bikes."
