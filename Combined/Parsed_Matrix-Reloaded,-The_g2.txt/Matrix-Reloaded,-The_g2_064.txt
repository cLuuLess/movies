ext. street

the metacortex building stands across  the street. neo has been  along
this road a thousand times, but in another lifetime.

neo raises one hand, palm pointed toward the building.

cut to:  neoÂ’s  pov:  the  building  is  a  massive  tower of  glowing
shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional polygon.
