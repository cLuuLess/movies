ext. road

the cruiser comes to  a stop mere inches  from gregorys leg. the  cop
bursts out of the door.

                                 cop

                    "what the hell are you doing?"

                               gregory

 "well tell you when to stop, little man. not the other way around."

                                 cop

                               "fuck."

he dives back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. gregory  pulls
a huge silver .44 from his jacket and fires. the cruisers antenna  is
blown off at the  base, and the nine-foot  whip flips onto the  ground
with a metallic clang.
