int. dead duck

neo is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the  bag.
hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet.

                                 choi

        "so, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?"

trinity nods,  herself in  disbelief. neo  picks his  head up  off the
table.

                                 neo

                    "kicked... kicked smiths ass."

           choi eyes morphes and niobe coming toward them.

                                 choi

     "hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, neo? like morpheus?"

                                 neo

             "morpheus? yeah, i smacked him around, too."

morpheus arrives just  in time to  hear the last  part. he stands  and
grins down at neo.

                               morpheus

                 "so, you can smack me around, neo?"

                                 neo

                         "oh yeah. anytime."

morpheus taps him on the forehead. neo blinks and falls back into  the
booth. he stands before them.

                               trinity

                            "hows tank?"

                               morpheus

 "hes on bereavement leave with his mother. dozer was the second son
                       shes lost in this war."

                    his comments set a sober tone.

                               morpheus

  "the nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. but,
                    thats not giving us a rest."

                               trinity

         "let me guess. weve been ordered back out anyway."

                               morpheus

 "yes. this is another special op. im in command, niobe and trinity
             are team leaders. neo is our secret weapon."

     flash to: neo, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.

                               morpheus

 "we dont know exactly what hes capable of. he may be just tapping
his potential, or he may have already reached it. we are to learn from
                      him, as he does from us."

                                 choi

"why are we always getting screwed? not only do i have to go straight
           back into the shit, but i lose my command, too?"

                               morpheus

"youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, choi."

                                dujour

 "yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
                              to death."

                                 choi

 "oh my god thats so funny. my point is, dont we need some r-and-r?
unwind a little? we lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five,
   right? shit. im glad we found mr. invincible, here, but jesus..."

                               morpheus

            "you dont have to go, choi. volunteers only."

                               trinity

        "hes got a point, m. i have faith, but why so quick?"

                               morpheus

 "we have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. our
 ships say the matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our
                          entry. and neos."

                                 choi

"fuck. every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do."

                               morpheus

                         "he is the one."

                                dujour

             "you havent lost the faith, have you choi?"

        choi grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down.

                                 choi

 "well, these are the times that try mens souls. heres to victory."
