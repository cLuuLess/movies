ext. desert highway (night)

far off  in the  distance, the  glow of  motorcycle headlights  racing
toward us. as we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close  to
avoid.  they  rip  by  us, thundering  explosions  and  men  and women
cheering.

the pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets.  they
fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total
abandon.


angle on the lead  motorcycle, a massive, custom-made  harley. gregory
lowfield, thomas j. anderson without  a desk job, without cares,  revs
his bike and locks  the accelerator. he hands  his beer to the  blonde
who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat,
leaning into the slipstream.

                       the feat is impossible.

his girlfriend,  chandra, screams  at him  as she  grasps the seat and
lowers herself to the bike.

                               chandra

                    "greg, are you fucking crazy?"

                                 greg

                       "yes. but dont worry."

she clings to  his legs as  they barrel down  the highway. they  blast
pass a darkened cruiser.
