neo closes the cell  phone. he reaches to  tuck it away, then  pauses,
looking at it. he drops it to the ground and walks on.

he stands out on   a finger of crumbling   church, the night air   all
around him.  the  city  lights are   alive below.  he  focuses  on the
metacortex building. leaving  him there, we  rush to it  until we dive
into the dark  shadows  of the  very building,  going  microscopically
close, until the  darkness gives way  to the glowing  green miasma  of
quantum  code.  it  fills  the  screen  before  we  bust  through into
darkness again.
