          shane and the kids are holding up a home-made sign:
          welcome home, mom! todd pushes stop on a cd player: the
          sound of music stops.
          
          zoe is in a conservative dress, todd a button down and
          khakis: barely recognizable. lulu has bows in her hair.
          peter is fresh faced, smiling, tyler is asleep: a picture-
          perfect family.
          
                                 zoe
                    welcome home, mom.
          
          julie starts bawling. the kids rush forward and hug her.
          across the room, shane sees bill enter. shane stiffens
          and salutes proudly.   s
                                   shane
                    captain.
          
                                 bill
                           (he smiles wryly, then
                            salutes back)
                    good job, lieutenant.
