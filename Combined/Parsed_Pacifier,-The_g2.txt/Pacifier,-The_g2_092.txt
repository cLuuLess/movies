          ext. plummer house - night
          
          shane is exhausted, as he pulls up in the minivan. he
          gets out -- and groans in disbelief. it's insanity: hip
          hop blasts, gyrating teenagers everywhere, chugging
          drinks, making out, peeing in the bushes, jocks throwing
          footballs.
          
          reeling, shane takes lulu, peter and tyler up the path.
          he protectively guides them past the craziness -- until a
          football suddenly whizzes by. outraged, shane snatches
          it mid-air -- then crushes the ball. pop!
          
           hane gives a blood-curdling stare.
          
                                 shane
                    party's over.
          
          the jocks flinch, scared, then run.   shane unlocks the
          club lock off the door.
