          int. family room - continuous
          
                                 shane
                    who are those people?
          
                                 lulu
                    it's my troop, it's monday. monday,
                    wednesday and saturday are troop nights.
          
                                 shane (o.s.)
                    get rid of them.
          
                                 lulu
                    i can't. everybody's parents go out on
                    troop nights. they won't be home `til
                    ten. mom's our den mother.
          
          lulu starts to sniffle, close to tears.
          
                                 lulu (cont'd)
                    tonight we're supposed to sell cookies.
          
                                 shane
                    selling cookies isn't imperative to my
                    mission.
          
                                 lulu
                    we have to. if we don't sell enough
                    cookies, we can't go the jamboree, and if
                    we can't go to the jamboree.
                           (whispers:)
                    come on, shane. you gotta help me out.
                    they already think i'm a loser. and it's
                    not like i have any other friends, cause
                    mom never lets me out of her sight...
          
                                                                 44.
          
          
          
          lulu's about to burst into tears. shane sighs.
