          shane enters... to find the kids are all gloomy.    the
          baby cries. shane awkwardly picks the baby up.
          
                                 shane
                    okay, listen up. there's been a change of
                    plans. your mom's not coming back as
                    soon as she thought...
          
          
          
                                                                     28.
          
          
          
                                   lulu
                             (worried)
                      when is she coming back?
          
                                   shane
                      soon. in the meantime, we're just gonna
                      have some more big fun.
          
                                   todd
                      that's what we've been doing?
          
                                   lulu
                      but tomorrow's a school day.

          shane reacts, inundated.
          
                                   shane
                      whoa, whoa! halt! we'll take this hill
                      one inch at a time. only then can we
                      rise to the challenge. all for one, and
                      one for all!
          
                                   lulu
                             (singing)
                      "be all that you can be!"
          
                                   shane
                      that's army. i'm navy.     but i appreciate
                      your enthusiasm.

                                   shane (cont'd)
                      tell me that was the duck?
          
          fwrppp!    we zoom in on the baby's leering face.
          
           hane quickly moves the baby away from his body. pure
          self-preservation, everyone bolts from the room.
          
                                    shane (cont'd)
                      hey.   hey!
          
          nobody will help.     even peter runs, holding his nose.
          
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
          close-up - shane
          
          he gulps.
