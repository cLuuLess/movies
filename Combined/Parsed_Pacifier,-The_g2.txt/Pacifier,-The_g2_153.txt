          int. garage - day
          
          shane leads bill inside. bill holds the pronged key.
          
                                  ill
                    i'm really proud of you, shane. i'm
                    giving you your choice of assignment,
                    anywhere you want. you just name it.
          
                                 shane
                    that's kind of you, sir...
                            pause)
                    but i'll have to think about it.
          
          bill stops, surprised.   shane continues, a bit reluctant.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    sir, all i've never known is the
                    military. at nine years old my father
                    put me in cadet school and from there i
                    never looked back. don't get me wrong, i
                    wouldn't trade it for anything and i have
                    no regrets...
          
          s
          
          
          
          
                                   s
          
          
          
          
                                                                    87.
          
          
          
                                 bill
                    i should hope not.
          
                                 shane
                    but being with these kids has made me
                    feel like there's more to life than
                    taking out your enemy. and i think i
                    want to explore that some more.
          
          suddenly, an angry voice.
          
                                 man's voice
                    put your hands up!!
          
          wide
          
          shane and bill spin, startled.    the chuns strides up,
          guns drawn.
          
                                 mrs. chun
                    give us the key!
          
                                 shane
                    mr. and mrs. chun?     they checked out-
          
                                   korean man
                    h
                        ands up!
          
          compliant, shane puts his hands behind his head. he
          takes a submissive position... mrs. chun comes closer,
          reaching for bill's key... shane shoots bill a glance...
          
                                   shane
                    now!
          
          shane spins and grabs both guns! he whacks the koreans'
          forearms, while slamming their heads together.
          
           hane takes control! he smiles, relishing a second of
          glory -- when suddenly, crack! a third gun butts him in
          the head.
          
          close-up - shane
          
          lights out. he turns, startled, and starts to fall.
          disoriented, confused, he looks up as he drops...
          
          shane's pov
          
          he is losing consciousness. things are spinning... woozy.
          
                                   b
          
          
          
          
                                                                        88.
          
          
          
                                  korean man
                            (arguing with bill)
                     you promised us ghost months ago!
          
                                  bill
                     i'm sorry, mr. chun. there were delays...
          
          shane peers in confusion, then passes out.
