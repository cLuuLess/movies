          int. plummer house - living room - continuous
          
          as zoe hangs up, we widen out: the house is packed with
          teenagers: they're keeping quiet until the phone is in
          its cradle, then the teenage dj starts the music back up.
          
          zoe looks around at the mess. she turns to scott, who
          doesn't seem concerned at all.
          
                                 zoe
                    dude, this is outta hand. who are all
                    these people?
          
                                 scott
                    jus' ma peeps. and the folks who read my
                    blog.

          zoe rolls her eyes, then notices a weird sweaty kid,
          who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the
          ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying squish.
          
                                 zoe
                    dude, not cool...

          - its a huge party: the place is jammed, kids everywhere.
          
          - teenagers come and go through the kitchen's doggy door.
