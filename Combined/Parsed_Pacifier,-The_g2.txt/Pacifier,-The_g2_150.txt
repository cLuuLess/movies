          int. julie's house - moments later
          
          julie opens the door, comes into the dark hall. bill is
          carrying her suitcases.
          
                                 julie
                    i had a fight with zoe when i left, so
                    they probably trashed the place...
          
          she trails off...
          
                                 bill
                    what's wrong?
          
          they listen -- they hear, in the next room, kids singing
          a beautiful, a capella version of the hills are alive
          (with the sound of music). she turns on the lights --
          what she sees makes her drop her luggage, in shock.

          julie's p.o.v.: the house is spotless. the rug is
          vacuumed. the fish tank is clear, filled with healthy
          tropical fish.
          
                                 kids voices
                           (singing, a capella)
                    ... with songs they have sung, for a
                    thousand years...
          
          dumb-struck, julie goes to the...
