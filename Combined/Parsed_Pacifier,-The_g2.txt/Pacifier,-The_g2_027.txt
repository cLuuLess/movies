          int. plummer house/foyer - day
          
          it's warm and quiet.   petite julie screams up the stairs-
          
                                 
          
          
                                                                   11.

                    kiiidds!!!
          
          shane startles, covers his ears.
          
                                 julie (cont'd)
                    get your butts down here and say "hello!"
          
          and then three pairs of feet come down the stairs. lulu,
          zoe, 15, and todd, 14 line up like the perfect family
          portrait. todd's hair hangs in his face. he wears a sid
          vicious shirt and a long trench coat.
          
                                 julie (cont'd)
                    you've already met lulu. this is peter,
                    zoe and todd. kids, this is lieutenant
                    wolfe. he's the man who is going to be
                    staying with us for a while.
          
          all the kids except for todd-
          
                                   kids
                    hi.
          
          shane nods, stern. on the stairs, a romanian maid walks
          by, carrying a baby.
          
                                 julie
                    and this is helga and tyler.
          
          shane nods hello to them.
          
                                 shane
                           (official:)

          zoe, lulu and todd climb back up the stairs. julie leads
          shane into...
