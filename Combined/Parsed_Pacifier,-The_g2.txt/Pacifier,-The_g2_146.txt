          we pan up from the white "us gov" license plates to bill
          at the wheel. julie sits beside him. bill's cell phone
          rings, he answers it.
          
                                shane
                    sir! excellent news. i think i found
                    ghost.
          
          bill reacts, excited.
          
                                 bill
                    ... do you have it?
          
                                 shane
                    no. it's in a steel vault. i've been
                    trying all night, can't crack it, sir.

                           (remaining calm)
                    good! good work. okay, don't do
                    anything further. we'll be there shortly
