          int. house/family room - night
          
           hane rushes in -- and finds lulu screaming and giggling
          in front of a video game. shane shakes his head.
          
                                 shane
                    could you turn that dow-
          
          and shane spies half of todd's face peeking around a
          corner staring at him...
                                 s
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    hey-
          
          todd disappears. waaaaa!! waaaaa!! shane spins, looks
          around for the crying baby... can't find him.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    ... where's the baby?
          
          without looking lulu points. a diapered peter stands in
          the half full aquarium, pouring in cheerios. helga
          enters holding the wailing tyler. gary suddenly flies by -
          - whrrp! shane ducks. shane scowls at helga:
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    you run a very loose ship.
          
                                 helga
                    you don't like it? you're the seal. you
                    do something. i make bottle.
          
           elga stomps out. shane heads down the hall, when in the
          corner of his eye -- he sees a figure scurry across the
          back lawn. shane turns off the light. he shuts off the
          window alarm and sneaks out silently.
          
                                                                   16.
