          ext. construction site - continuous
          
          two big construction workers are standing on the other
          side of the plywood wall -- shane kicks out one entire
          section, and charges through.
          
                                 construction worker
                    what hell do you think you're doing?
          
          he turns around, to see several construction workers, all
          brandishing tools.
          
                                 shane
                    tell me where the kids are and i'll let
                    you all live!
          
                                 construction worker
                    buddy, you're about to get a beat down.
          
          three workers rush him. shane easily takes them out. the
          remaining workers give shane a scared look -- then run.
          
          angle - shane
          
          he's alone. he catches his breath, then checks his
          tracker. todd and zoe's beeps are coming from a manhole.
          
          shane pries off the manhole cover.    he looks down.
          
          in the manhole - it's dark and dank.
          
          no sweat. shane lowers himself down.
