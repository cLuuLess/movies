          int. grocery store - moments later
          
          shane watches the brownies on the store's closed circuit
          monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store. he looks
          around at the bright, colorful boxes of children's
          cereals, rainbow fruit roll-ups, snack packs... nothing
          looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food.
          
          he sees: a huge, 100 pack value case of spam. he smiles.
          tyler looks at him -- "what are you, nuts?"
