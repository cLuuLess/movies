          ext. mall parking lot - early morning
          
          the lot is empty. shane and zoe sit in the minivan, shane
          holds a stopwatch. he signals her, she burns rubber, and
          races through a slalom of orange cones -- she hits every
          one -- the wheel hubs are clogged with cones. she skids
          to a stop just short of the "severe tire damage" spikes.
