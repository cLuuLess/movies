           the droning of engines becomes less pronounced. foam
          from the boat and skis bubbles.
          
          calm. then from out of nowhere five navy seals wearing re-
          breathers appear, in neat formation like the blue angels.
          jet propelled backpacks push the seals through the water.
          
          the lead seal: shane wolfe, points upwards. all eyes
          follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above.
          from his belt, shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive
          disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and fires.
          a cable shoots up -- thud... the disc sticks to the
          boat's hull. shane pushes a button on the wand retracting
          the cable and drawing himself closer.
          
          dangling from the cruiser, shane fixes a bomb to the
          hull. he releases himself from the boat and speeds away --
          
                           
          
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
          boom. a dense explosion sends ripples through the water
          and electricity crackling around the boat.
