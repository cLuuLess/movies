          ext. back yard - late night
          
          the house is dark. shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping
          the area with night vision goggles on. gary sits in the
          next chair. shane sighs morosely.
          
                                 shane
                    just another assignment. no reason for
                    personal attachments.
          
          shane takes a sip out of a juice box. he pets the duck.

                    hey gary, your wings aren't clipped. how
                    come you don't fly away?

                    i guess you've got it good.    kids to play
                    with. three squares a day.
          
           he duck stares, unblinking.

                    all quiet on the western front. i guess i
                    better fix that playroom window.

           hane rises.
