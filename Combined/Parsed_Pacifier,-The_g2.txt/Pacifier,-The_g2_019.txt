          int. helicopter - a second later
          
          shane appears at the pilot's door, holding the professor.
          shane addresses the pilot in perfect serbian.
          
                                 shane
                    you know how to swim?
          
          the pilot nods, terrified. shane tosses the pilot out.
          
          shane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls,
          pulling the professor in behind him.

          on the surface of the water - continuous
          
          the seals on the jet skis salute shane in the chopper,
          then disappear gracefully back into the water.
