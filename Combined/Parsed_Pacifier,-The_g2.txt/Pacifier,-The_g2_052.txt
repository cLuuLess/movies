          int.   hallway - night
          
          shane patrols the hall, making sure all the doors and
          windows are locked. lulu is in her pj's.
          
          a hand tugs on shane's shirt, he looks down to see lulu.
          
                                   lulu
                      hi. zoe thinks you look like the hulk. i
                      think you're cute.
          
                                   shane
                             (unsure how to respond...)
                      thank you.
          
          lulu doesn't go away, she just stares at him, it starts
          making shane uncomfortable.
          
                                   lulu
                      do you know kung fu?
          
                                     shane
                      affirmative.
          
                                   lulu
                      did you ever punch someone so hard that
                      their head came off?
          
           hane walks away from lulu. she follows. shane is again
          twirling the medal in his fingers. lulu follows at his
          heels, like a puppy.
          
                       
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          
                                 lulu (cont'd)
                    what's that medal for?
          
                                 shane
                    none of your business.
          
                                 lulu
                    i'll trade you a spongebob button for it.
          
          shane walks room to room, pulling down the shades on
          every window.
          
                                 lulu (cont'd)
                    is that so people can't hurt us?
          
          he bends down to her level, and tries to sound sweet:
          
                                 shane
                    i think -- it's time for you take a nappy-
                    poo, in beddibye land, little girl.
          
          lulu looks at him, like he's an idiot.
          
                                 lulu
                    do i look like i'm five to you?
          
          lulu sulks off to bed, and shuts off her light.
          
          all the lights are out, all the kids asleep. shane
          breathes a sigh of relief, and patrols.
