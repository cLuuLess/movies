                    oh my god!

                    no - it's okay. they're gone, everyone's
                    fine. they were looking for ghost, but
                    they didn't find it. you have any luck?
          
                                 julie
                    well, yes and no. we found something in
                    the box... but we're not sure what it is.
                    bill thinks it's part of the ghost. it
                    looks like some kind of "key". we just
                    don't know what its for.
          
          she holds up the strange, metal two pronged key.

                    the good news is i'll be home in two
                    days, as soon as the customs paperwork
                    clears.

                           (very genuine)
                    ...so soon? we were just starting to have
                    fun. don't worry -- we'll be just fine.
