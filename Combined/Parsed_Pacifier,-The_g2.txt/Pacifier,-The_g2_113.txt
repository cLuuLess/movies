          int. plummer house - upstairs hallway - later
          
          shane's patrolling the hallway. he hears zoe in her
          room, breaking something, angrily. he peeks in -- just as
          zoe throws her cell-phone into the wall, furious.
          
                                 shane
                    ... what's up?
          
                                 zoe
                           (embarrassed)
                    nothing... it's stupid... scott. i called
                    him in his room, another girl picked up
                    the phone. i know it's no big deal. i
                    don't know why i let it get to me.
          
                                 shane
                    i don't see what you see in this guy.
          
                                 zoe
                    it's just nice to think someone's
                    thinking about you, you know?
                                 s
                                 shane
                           (he nods)
                    it won't happen again.
          
                                 zoe
                    ... no wait! ...what are you gonna do?
                    you're not gonna hurt him are you?
                    promise you won't touch him.
          
                                 shane
                    okay. i promise. i won't touch him.
          
          shane exits. he turns out the light.
