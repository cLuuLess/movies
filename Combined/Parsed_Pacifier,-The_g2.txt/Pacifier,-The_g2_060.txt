          int. lunch-line - continuous
          
          students are in a ring, cheering, as four students in
          wrestling jackets hold todd. one reaches down and gives
          todd a "wedgy" then another wrestler punches him. todd
          slips out of their hold and decks the wrestler. vp murney
          is watching, but not stopping it. zoe, in the crowd,
          cheers todd on:
          
                                 zoe
                    kick his butt, todd!
          
          shane and claire push through the students. as soon as
          they see the principal, the crowd freezes.
          
                                  rincipal claire
                    who started this?
          
          silence. then vice principal murney steps forward.
          
                                 murney
                    he did. (todd)
          
          
                                                                    38.
          
          
          
                                 principal claire
                    todd started a fight with five students
                    at once?
          
          shane turns to todd, and "punches fists" with him,
          impressed.
          
                                 murney
                    the kid's mixed up. look at him.
          
                                 principal claire
                    if i catch anyone on the team fighting
                    again, next week's tournament is off. i
                    don't care who starts it.
          
          murney smirks, and gives her a "i'll handle it" wink.
          
                                 murney
                    you heard the lady. any more fighting and
                    there'll be no more wrestling. personally
                    i think that's a little harsh. boys'll be
                    boys. (low, to todd:) `scept for plummer
                    here.
          
          todd lunges at him. shane effortlessly grabs todd and
          judo flips him -- todd lands on his feet, sticking the
          landing. no one is more ssurprised than todd and shane.
          
                                 shane
                    ... nice moves, man.
          
          the bell rings, the crowd breaks up. murney approaches
          shane.
          
                                 murney
                    pretty slick, frogman -- i'm a black belt
                    myself. s'why they asked me to coach the
                    wrestling team.
          
          murney makes a loud kung fu cry and throws a punch,
          stopping an inch from shane's head. shane doesn't flinch.
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    see -- total control. maybe you could
                    stop by practice, we'd show the boys how
                    a couple of pros do it, what do you say?
                    come on, promise i'll go easy on you.
          
                                 shane
                    ... sorry, sir. i'm on duty.
          
                           
          
          
                                                                39.
          
          
          
                                 murney
                    oh, yeah. that's right. i forgot you had
                    to baby-sit. maybe some other time then.
          
          shane puts an arm over todd's shoulder. todd shakes him
          off and heads to class. murney snickers to claire:
          
                                 murney (cont'd)
                    looks like pretty boy there's all bark
                    and no bite.
          
                                 principal claire
                    ... don't even think it, murney. he'd
                    kill you so fast, i wouldn't even have
                    time to get my camera.
