          int. zoe's bedroom - moments later
          
          shane's finishing up the last window.
          
                                 zoe
                    this is totally cruel and unusual! you
                    can't do this -- we could run out of air!
          
          shane lifts her window so it's open a half inch, then
          drills it into place. shane ushers the troop out the
          door, then loads peter and tyler into two snuggles -- one
          attached to his front, the other to his back. shane
          closes the front door and attaches a "club" lock to it.
          
                 
          
                                                                 45.
