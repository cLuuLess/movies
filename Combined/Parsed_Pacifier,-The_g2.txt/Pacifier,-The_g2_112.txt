          int. old warehouse - continuous
          
          shane follows the hitler youth into a large room, set up
          with folding chairs. he hides in a dark corner. todd and
          the hitler youth enter, and take seats. a creepy man in
          a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them. shane
          watches as the man addresses the hitler youth.
          
                                 man
                    alright. all my nazis are finally here.
                    okay, i want all of you at attention.
          
          the nazis stand at attention. shane is horrified...
          
                                 man (cont'd)
                    and on stage left - (he yells) von
                    trapps! i need my von trapps!
          
           hane watches... as a group of blonde actors, all dressed
          in lederhosen as the singing von trapp family enter, and
          join the "nazis." there's also a few nuns, a captain von
          trapp, and a maria. the creepy man is, in fact, a good
          natured, slightly foppish director.
          
          
                                                                64.
          
          
          
                                 director
                    okeydokey. starting from where we left
                    off gimme rolf and liesl -- let's give
                    you are sixteen a run up der flagpole...
          
          todd heads up to the stage, the director arranges him and
          the actress playing liesl (40ish) into position. an
          accompanist begins on piano, todd sings, remarkably well:
          
                                 todd
                    you wait little girl, on an empty
                    stage/for fate to turn the light on/your
                    life little girl, is an empty page/that
                    men will want to write on...
          
                                 actress/liesl
                    to write on...
          
                                 todd
                    you are sixteen, going on seventeen...
          
          shane bursts into laughter. his whole face lights up for
          the first time ever...
          
          todd and liesl dance. todd is good, but nervous. he
          attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the
          stage, clutching his ankle. he gets up, and limps to the
          seats. the director walks onto the stage, upset. he
          looks up, to heaven:
          
                                 director
                    baby jesus, have i done some unspeakable
                    evil that i deserve to be saddled with
                    the world's worst production of sound of
                    music? (he shouts, at the cast:) we open
                    in a week. the set's not finished... the
                    cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every
                    kick ball change would make bob fosse dig
                    himself out of the earth, so he could
                    have a heart attack again.
          
                                 todd
                    i'm sorry... i'll get it right.
          
                                 director
                    none of you will ever get it right! which
                    is why, i quit.
          
          he throws down his script. the cast is stunned.
          
                                 director (cont'd)
                    and with that, he exits stage right...
                    end scene.
          
                              
          
          
                                                                   65.
          
          
          
          and, on his own cue... he exits stage right, in a huff.
          the entire cast looks to todd, fuming.
          
          shane jumps up from his hiding place, startling
          everybody. everyone steps back. todd is terrified.
          
          shane kneels down beside todd. he closes his eyes, and
          begins rubbing his hands together like mr. miyagi.
          
                                 liesl
                    you gonna fix him?
          
                                 shane
                    no. my hands are freezing.
          
          shane grabs todd's ankle hard and unceremoniously cracks
          it, and yanks him to his feet.
          
                                 todd
                    i'm not going to quit. i hate wresting...
          
                                 shane
                    at ease. (todd shuts up) would you
                    listen, just once? look, i don't know a
                    hell of a lot about this kinda stuff,
                    but... you're good. a lot to learn, but
                    with hard work, discipline -- you could
                    make a go of this.
          
                                 todd
                    ... but what about murney?
          
                                 shane
                    that guy's an idiot.
          
          todd smiles, relieved. they sit on the edge of the stage.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    "sound of music" is a great show. my dad
                    took me to see it when i was a kid.
          
          shane smiles wistfully. todd relaxes.
          
                                 todd
                    you don't seem like the musical type.
          
                                 shane
                    come on. julie andrews was hot.
          
                                 todd
                    what if... girls'll think i'm... weird or
                    something?
          
                                                                66.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                    you know what girls think is weird?
                    wrestling. men in leotards pinning each
                    other to the floor? i've never understood
                    that. chicks dig guys who can dance.
          
                                 todd
                    doesn't matter now anyway... show's
                    off... it's over.
          
          shane looks at the cast, they look pretty glum as they
          pack up their costumes. todd looks devastated -- only a
          moment after shane saw him happier than ever. shane
          straightens up, grabbing todd by the shirt collar. beat.
          
                                 shane
                    company -- center stage!
          
          everyone looks around, they're not sure what to do... off
          shane's glare, they quickly assemble on stage.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    do you, or do you not have what it takes
                    to perform this musical?
          
          there's some mumbling. liesl chimes in.
          
                                 liesl
                    we don't have a director...
          
          shane shakes his head.
          
                                 shane
                    no director? i have directed rescue
                    missions in afghanistan! i've directed
                    numerous snatch and grabs in countries
                    who's names you are not allowed to know.
                    i have choreographed multi-pronged
                    amphibious landings and stealth air
                    attacks!
                           (full of bravado)
                    do you think i have the stomach to whip
                    this production into shape, or not?
          
          everyone nods... todd looks up at shane. he smiles.
          
                                   todd
                    yes.
          
                                   shane
                    yes what?
          
                           
          
          
                                                                67.
          
          
          
                                 todd/cast
                    yessir.
