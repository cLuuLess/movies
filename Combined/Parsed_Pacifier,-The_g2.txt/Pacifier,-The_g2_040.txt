           hane marches to todd's shut door. he tries the knob,
          but it's locked. shane bangs hard on it.

                    red 4!    open this door!
          
          no answer. shane turns away from the door and donkey
          kicks it...smash! the wood cracks, then crashes inward.
          the entire frame collapses.
