          int. hospital - day
          
          shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. his arm and
          face bandaged.
          
          shane's captain enters: bill fawcett (35) -- friendly,
          unassuming. he looks like he hasn't slept in days. shane
          salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute,
          but he does it anyway.
          
                                 shane
                    captain, sir.
          
                                 bill
                    as you were lieutenant.
          
          bill sits down beside the bed. he takes a long look at
          shane. he holds a report in his hand.
          
                                 bill (cont'd)
                    we've been through a lot together shane.
                    you're the best man i ever trained. and a
                    good friend.
          
                                 shane
                    ... i know sir. and i except full
                    responsibility for the mission's failure.
          
                                 bill
                    why the hell did you let him use the
                    satellite phone?
          
                                 shane
                    he had to call his family. a lapse in
                    judgement on my part that i regret sir.
          
                                                                   8.
          
          
          
          bill shakes his head, disappointed. he pulls up a chair,
          and sits opposite shane.
          
                                 bill
                    ... plummer was the best security expert
                    the department of defense ever had -- a
                    genius. he was working on a program that
                    scrambles launch codes. he called it
                    g.h.o.s.t.: guided high-altitude
                    scrambling transmitter. one pulse from
                    the ghost satellite and a country can't
                    launch its own nukes. that's what the
                    serbians kidnapped him for, but they
                    couldn't get s
                                 inside the briefcase.
          
                                 shane
                    the case was empty sir, as i stated in my
                    report.
          
          bill considers this. then...
          
                                 bill
                    not a surprise, really. not like the
                    professor to hide things where someone
                    might look for them. g.h.o.s.t. is still
                    out there, (bill smiles:) which is why
                    i'm going to give you another shot.
          
          shane sits up. he can't believe his good fortune.
          
                                 shane
                    sir. thank you. i... appreciate your
                    confidence.
          
          invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an iv,
          and starts to rise.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    i'll need to put a team together. i'm
                    gonna need the mini sub, i need access to
                    an ep3 aries 2 spy plane...
          
                                 bill
                           (interrupting:)
                    negative. it's not that kind of mission.
          
          shane listens, intrigued.
          
                                 bill (cont'd)
                    two days ago, i got a call from the
                    professor's wife... widow. she told me
                    someone had broken into her home.
                    searched the place, top to bottom.
                                 (more)
          
                             
          
                                                                   9.
                                 bill(cont'd)
                    she's scared. the family's scared.
                    whoever killed the professor must think
                    g.h.o.s.t. is in that house. maybe it is,
                    maybe it isn't. either way, i need
                    someone to stay at that house, and
                    protect them. and while you're there --
                    find out if the program is in there.
          
                                 shane
                    that's it? why would you want me for
                    that, sir.
          
                                 bill
                    the professor's wife requested you.
          
          shane is surprised... bill pulls a tiny tape recorder
          from his pocket, presses play, we hear professor
          plummer's voice.
          
                                 charles (o.s.)
                    honey, i'm alive. listen: a lot can
                    happen between here and home -- if
                    anything happens to me, call lt. shane
                    wolfe. he's a good man... anyway, i
                    should go. i'll call you in an hour. i
                    love you.
          
          shane is shocked, hearing the dead man's voice.
          
                                 bill
                    ... you gotta problem with this mission?
          
                                 shane
                    sirnosir. it's just that... i've never
                    been very good with kids, sir. not even
                    when i was a kid sir.
          
                                                               cut to:
