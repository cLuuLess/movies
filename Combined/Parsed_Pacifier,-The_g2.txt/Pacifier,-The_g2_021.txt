          ext. mountain clearing - a little later
          
          a pave hawk sh-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly,
          waits. shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line
          and sets down atop the mountain by a stream.
          
          shane and charles sprint from the chopper towards the
          waiting hawk. charles stops shane.
          
                                 charles
                    lieutenant, thank you. (he pats his
                    briefcase) you saved more than just my
                    life today. can i call my wife to let
                    her know i'm okay?
          
                                 shane
                    negative. not imperative to the mission.
                    we have to keep moving. i have strict
                    orders to get you out of here safely.
          
                                 charles
                    i'm safe, lieutenant. please. she thinks
                    i'm dead. (then) don't you have a family?
          
                  
          
                                                                    6.
          
          
          
                                  shane
                            (this gets him:)
                     make it quick.
          
          charles picks up his briefcase. he holds the lock up to
          his mouth and whispers into it:
          
                                  charles
                     joe, todd, lulu, peter, tyler.
          
          the briefcase pops open. shane looks at him, puzzled.
          
                                  charles (cont'd)
                     my kids. it's voice activated. designed
                     it myself. i do security, that's my
                     specialty. (gestures back:) those guys
                     back there tried to get this case open
                     for five days -- couldn't crack it. and
                     you should see what happens to you if
                     open it without the code. i have a
                     picture of my kids in here, you want to
                     see it?
          
                                  shane
                     negative.
          
          charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. shane looks
          in the case: it's empty, except for the phone and a
          family photo. charles dials his cell phone... nothing
          
                                  charles
                     battery's dead...
          
          shane considers, then hands him his satellite phone.
          charles dials, and talks...
          
                                  charles (cont'd)
                     honey, i'm alive...
