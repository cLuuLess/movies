          int. school hallway - 2:55
          
          shane looks exhausted. peter is asleep in his shoulder,
          tyler is crying, as he keeps watch. the principal strolls
          up.
          
                                 principal claire
                    another day, another dollar twenty, minus
                    taxes... aren't you gonna change him?
          
                                 shane
                    i'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not
                    cry.
          
                                 principal claire
                    that's not what i mean, lt.
          
          then shane smells what she means -- tyler's diaper is
          full. shane recoils in disgust, holding tyler out like a
          grenade.
          
                                 shane
                    oh -- change him. roger that. uh...
          
          panicked, he pushes tyler towards the principal.
          
                                 principal claire
                    sirnosir. not my job.
          
                                 shane
                    but...
          
                                 principal claire
                    instructions are right on the box.
                    bathroom's down the hall. have fun.
          
                                                                   40.
          
          
          
          just then, an alarm in his jacket goes off. he looks at
          his tracker: it's flashing red 3 red 3. shane hands off
          peter and tyler to the principal.
          
                                 shane
                    emergency!
