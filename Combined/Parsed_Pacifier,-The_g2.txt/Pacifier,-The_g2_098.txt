          int. plummer house - various
          
          shane works his way through the house. it's spotless:
          counter tops glisten, furniture polished. it looks like
          better homes and gardens. he heads upstairs. zoe blows
          past him -- into the bathroom, where she throws up. shane
          sits down, outside the bathroom door.
          
                                 zoe
                    ... thanks a lot, rambo. my friends will
                    never come here again.
          
                                 shane
                    those people aren't your friends. they
                    show no respect for you or your house.
                    because you have no respect for yourself.
          
                                 zoe
                    i do too respect myself.
          
           ueasy, she pukes again. shane hands her a handkerchief.
          
                                 shane
                    you got barf on your tank top.
                    (announces:) company, downstairs!
          
          he walks down the hall, zpounding on doors.
          
                                 zoe
                    you're not my dad!
          
          shane stops. lulu and todd step into the hall. zoe gets
          up, shaky and furious, and screams in shane's face.
          
                                 zoe (cont'd)
                    we hate you, you hate us. you're like a
                    robot. why don't you just leave us alone?
          
          silence. lulu's crying, todd picks her up. shane stands,
          helpless. after a beat...
          
                
          
          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          
                                 shane
                    you're right, red 1. i'm not the man for
                    this job.
          
                                 lulu
                    shane --!
          
                                 shane
                    in all my years i have never been treated
                    with such disrespect. not even from the
                    enemy. don't worry, as soon as your mom
                    comes back, i'm gone.
          
          suddenly -- the power goes out.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    now what?
          
                                 zoe
                    (sighs, tired) it's scott...
          
                                 shane
                    puberty... talking doesn't do any good.
                    go to your rooms.
          
          suddenly, two ninjas, all in black burst in through the
          window. shane spins in fight-stance.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                           (to the kids:)
                    go!
          
          terrified, zoe and todd scoop up the kids and rush down
          the hall.
          
          the ninjas pull a retractable kendo staffs. wielding them
          with great skill. it takes all of shane's skill to fend
          them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast.
          until shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded folding
          ladder and clocks a ninja with it. he goes down, but
          shane is shocked from behind by the other ninja. the
          ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. their kendo
          staffs hiss with a powerful electric current. the ninjas
          knock shane backwards down the stairs...
          
                                 ninja
                    ghost -- hand it over!
          
          they leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs,
          knocking him into...
          
          
          
                                                                56.
