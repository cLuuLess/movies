          int. todd's room - morning
          
          todd sits up, disoriented, not understanding what's
          happening. the whistle gets louder. suddenly his door
          flies open -- and shane strides in with a boom box. todd
          blinks groggily.
          
                                 todd
                    w-what are you doing??!
          
                                 shane
                    you're burning daylight. move.       move.
          
                                  odd
                    it's sunday...!
                           (he squints at a clock)
                    and it's six a.m. you're insane.
          
          todd pulls the blanket over his head. shane flips the
          mattress over spilling todd to the floor.
          
                                   shane
                    now move it!
          
          todd scrambles to his feet and out the door.
