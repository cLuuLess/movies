          ext. parking lot - seconds later
          
          shane runs up to the minivan. the brownies are huddled
          behind it, trembling.
          
                                 shane
                    what happened? (no one answers) well?
          
                                 lulu
                    those boys over there broke our cookies.
          
          shane eyes the cub scouts. dead serious:
          
                                 shane
                    well then -- i'm afraid i have to
                    eliminate them. if i don't come back --
                    avenge my death.
          
          he heads toward the scouts. the brownies scream.
          
                                 brownies
                    no!
          
          shane stops. he bends down, and points at lulu's panic
          button. he firmly tells lulu, who's close to tears:
          
                                 shane
                    this is not a toy. i'm here to protect
                    you. not cookies. get in the car, we're
                    going home.
          
                                 brownie
                    you can't take us home yet, you're
                    supposed to take us to dinner.
          
                                 shane
                    where?
