          at the end of peter's crib, shane performs the "panda
          dance." singing and doing all the moves -- he's got it
          down, adding a james brown flourish, now and then.

                    don't touch that dial sleep for a while --
                    heaaay! and say good night, peter panda.
          
          he does a spin kick. then he tucks peter in.
          
                                 shane (cont'd)
                    good night, peter.
          
                                 peter
                           (going to sleep)
                    good night, daddy.
          
          shane is so touched, he almost bursts into tears. he
          kisses peter on the forehead.
          
                                 shane
                    i'm not your daddy, peter. but sweet
                    dreams.
