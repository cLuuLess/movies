          int. plummer house - morning - later
          s
           hane does one-handed push ups in the living room while
          the duck watches. with his other hand he loads the photo
          of the chun's license plate into his laptop computer.
          his head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the
          rumble of a car approaching.
          
                                    l
          
                                    s
          
          
          
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
          he rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and
          opens it, just as -- whack -- the morning paper connects
          with his face, hard. from off-screen we hear a paperboy.
          
                                    paperboy (o.s.)
                    sorry dude!
          
          shane rubs his nose. lulu screams at the top of her
          lungs. shane turns, to see that peter is chasing her,
          wearing a towel as a sheet. he pretends to be a ghost.
          
                                    peter
                    whhhoooooo!
          
                                 lulu
                    stop it, peter!
          
          lulu hides behind shane. peter booos again. lulu screams.
          
                                 shane
                    hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of
                    anything.
          
                                 lulu
                    this house is haunted. daddy even said
                    so. he said there's a ghost.
          
          and then it hits shane.       his eyes light up.
          
                                  shane
                    really?   and where is this ghost?
          
                                     ulu
                    i don't know.     i've never seen it.
