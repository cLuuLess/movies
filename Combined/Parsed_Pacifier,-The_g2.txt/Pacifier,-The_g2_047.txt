          int. swiss bank - day
          
          bill and julie, looking jet-lagged, sit across a desk
          from a swiss banker. he seems to be about 100 years old.
          he's reading a huge stack of paperwork with a magnifying
          glass, mouthing along in french. it's taking him a long
          time. they wait patiently -- til their patience runs out.
          
                                 bill
                    as we discussed, this is an urgent
                    matter.
          
          the banker puts up a finger to "shush" him. then looks
          back to the paperwork, then licks his finger to turn the
          page. he licks his finger again, but can't get the page
          to turn.
          
                                                                     25.
          
          
          he feebly gets up, and shuffles across the room to a
          water cooler. he fills a paper cup with water and
          shuffles back to his desk. he dips his finger in the
          water to turn the page.
          
                                 julie
                    can't you call somebody? do something to
                    get us around all this paperwork?
          
                                 bill
                    sorry. not in switzerland, i can't.
          
           bill can't stand it anymore. he jumps to his feet.
          
                                  bill (cont'd)
                    this is absurd. if we can't get some
                    faster service, we're going to have to
                    file a complaint.
          
          the banker looks at him blankly.
          
                                   banker
                    marcel!
          
          another banker, marcel, enters.
          
                                   marcel
                    oui.
          
                                 banker
                    je ne comprende pas.
          
                                 marcel
                           (to bill and julie:)
                    i'm so sorry, the chief does not speak
                    english. but i can tell you -- you will
                    have access to the box tout-suite. as
                    soon as your background checks clear.
          
                                 julie
                    thank you. how long is that?
