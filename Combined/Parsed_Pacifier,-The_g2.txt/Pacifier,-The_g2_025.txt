          int. shane's apartment - night
          
          shane packs his duffel bag. he opens a drawer: there's
          five t-shirts, identical to the one he wears. he opens
          another drawer: five khaki pants, also identical to the
          one he wears. he opens the closet: there's a massive fur-
          collared coat. hm. he rejects it.
          
          shane packs his duffel with military gear: gps compass,
          night vision goggles, camouflage vest, machete... they
          all go in. shane heads to the door, then goes back to his
          chest of drawers. he reaches in, and pulls out a small,
          old medal: the ribbon is faded and frayed. he looks at it
          for a moment, then unzips his suit and pins it to the
          inside, like it's a lucky rabbit's foot.
