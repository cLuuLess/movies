          the groundhog is just poking his head out of the hole. he
          stands full height and looks around.
          phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming
          madness.
          suddenly, phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his
          icoat and dives at the groundhog. town officials and police
          throw themselves on phil as the groundhog scampers safely back
          into his hole.
          rita and larry videotape the incident, aghast at phil's insane
          attack.
