          int. berghof restaurant - day

          phil enters the crowded restaurant and pushes past all the
          people waiting to be seated. he walks casually but quickly and
          purposefully around the tables, squeezing past busy waitresses
          and seated patrons toward a commotion in the back of the
          restaurant.
          two businessmen are leaning over a third.

           businessman
           oh, my god! he's having a heart
           attack!

           second businessman
           lay him down!

           breathing1

           second businessman
           he's turning blue! help!
          phil walks straight up to the blue-faced man, grabs him from
          behind, gets him in the heimlich grip and squeezes sharply.
          a bolus of food flies across the room. the victim coughs and
          sputters, then starts breathing again.

           first businessman
           jerry, you okay?

           second businessman
           i think that did it.
          phil lets go of the grateful victim.

           phil
           if you're going to eat steak, get
           better teeth, will you? enjoy
           the rest of your lunch, gents.
          he exits.

           jerry
           wow. who was that guy?
          phil gets to the door and finds rita standing there, looking at
          him in awe.

           phil
           rita!

           want to know what' s going on and
           i want to know right now.

           right now. meet me outside the
           hospital about 5:00 and we'll

           rita

          phil looks at his watch and rushes away.

           phil
