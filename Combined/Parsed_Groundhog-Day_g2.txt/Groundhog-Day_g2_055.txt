          ext. main street - moments later

          phil passes the old bum, ignoring him as usual.

           ned (o.c.)
           hey, phil!
          phil slips off his glove as ned ryerson lumbers toward him.

           ned
           phil! phil connors!

           phil
           ned! ned ryerson! ned the head!
          before ned can say another word, phil slugs him. ned goes
          down, phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking.
          phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before. a
          pedestrian walking behind him steps right into it.

          ext . gobbler's knob - later
          phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area
          when he notices nancy, the girl he met at the hotel bar, and
          stops to talk to her.

           phil
           you here to see the groundhog?
          she gives him a look. it's obvious she's never seen him
          before.

           nancy
           can you think of another reason
           anybody'd be out here at dawn on
           a freezing day?

           phil
           what's your name?

           nancy
           nancy taylor. and you are--

          

           phil

           nancy
           what is this?

           phil

           (playful)
           high school?
          she really doesn't know what to make of phil but she decides to
          play along.

           nancy
           lincoln high school. in
           pittsburgh. who are you?

           phil
           who was your twelfth grade
           english teacher?

           nancy
           are you kidding?

           phil

           phil
           walsh. nancy, lincoln, walsh.

           nancy

           phil
           i'm not really sure. we'll have
           to see.
          phil walks off and joins rita at their camera position.
