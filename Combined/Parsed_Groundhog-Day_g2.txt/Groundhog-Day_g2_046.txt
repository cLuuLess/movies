          phil is at a bar getting drunk with two local blue-collar
          workers, gus and phil.

           phil
           gus, what would you do if there
           was no tomorrow?

           gus
           you mean like if the world was
           gonna end?

           phil
           no, i mean like if it was never
           going to end. if everyday was
           the same and you were stuck here
           and you couldn't get out and
           nothing you did mattered?

           gus
           you're right. everyday is the
           same, i can't get out of here and
           nothin' i do matters.

           spend all my time drivin' fast,
           gettin1 loaded and gettin' laid.
           that's it.

           phil

           any better than this, does it?
