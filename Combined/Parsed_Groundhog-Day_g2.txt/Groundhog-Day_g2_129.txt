          ext. street corner - day

          phil walks briskly toward an intersection, glancing nervously
          at his watch. rita follows him at a distance, hurrying to keep
          up.
          marie, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection
          shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat. she isn't
          paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck
          bearing down on her.
          as she steps off the curb, phil arrives and, with split-second
          timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her
          back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly
          missing her.

           phil
           hey! did you forget to look both
           ways? you didn't even look one
           way.

           marie
           my doggie was cold.

           phil
           yeah, well, my doggies are
           freezing, but i ' m still gonna
           watch out for cars. see you
           around, kid.
          phil looks at his watch and rushes off.
          rita looks on amazed and follows him at a distance.
