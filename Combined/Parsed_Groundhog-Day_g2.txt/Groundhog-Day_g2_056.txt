          int. diner - later that morning

          phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an
          incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage,
          pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc.
          rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs
          himself with pastry.

           rita
           is this some new fad diet? don't
           you worry about cholesterol?
          phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate
          eclair.

          

           -52-

          

           phil
           i don't worry about anything
           anymore.

           rita
           what makes you so special?
           everybody worries about
           something.

           phil
           that's exactly what makes me so
           special.
          he takes a big bite of cake. rita shakes her head.

           phil
           (with his mouth full)
           what?

           rita
           "the wretch, concentered all
           in self,
           living, shall forfeit fair
           renown,
           and doubly dying, shall go
           down to the vile dust from
           whence he sprung,
           unwept, unhonored, and
           unsung." sir walter scott.

           phil
           (stares at her for a
           long moment)
           "there was a young man from
           na n t uc k e t-- "

           rita
           that's really funny. when are
           you going to grow up, phil?

           phil
           at this rate-- never.
           (he pulls out a pack of

           cigarettes)
           okay if i smoke?
          rita shrugs. phil lights up a cigarette.

           rita
           you really do have a death wish,
           don't you?

           phil
           just the opposite, rita. i have
           a life wish. i'm just trying to
           enjoy it. taking pleasure in the
           little things. don't you ever
           just want to cut loose and go
           wild?

          

           -53-

          

           rita
           i wouldn't even know what it
           means to go wild.

           phil
           yeah, well, that's where i come
           in. going wild is one of my
           specialties. last night i got
           completely loaded and drove head-
           on into a police car.

           rita

           (disbelieving)
           oh, really? you look pretty good
           this morning.

           phil
           that's my point. i know you
           won't believe me, but we could do
           anything we want today and it
           wouldn't matter one bit.
           absolutely no consequences.
           complete and total freedom.

           rita
           and how. . , do we manage that?

           phil
           you leave that to me. why don't
           you send larry back and hang out
           with me for the rest of the day?
           you never make it through that
           blizzard anyway.
          larry enters the diner and spots them.

           rita
           i'll take my chances with the
           -weather. but you have a good
           time.

           phil
           don't worry. i plan to.

           cut to:
