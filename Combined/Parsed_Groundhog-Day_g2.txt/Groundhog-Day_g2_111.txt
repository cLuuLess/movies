          rita and larry are in the packed press area, beginning to set
          up the equipment.
          phil arrives, carrying two cups of coffee.

           phil
           rita?
          she looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the
          night before.

           rita
           oh, hi, phil.

           phil
           thought you might like some--
          he hands her the coffee.

           rita
           thanks!

           phil
           careful, it's hot. larry?
          he hands larry a cup.

           larry
           (surprised, mutters)
           yeah, great.

           rita
           we're just setting up.

           phil
           you know, i bumped into buster
           greene, he kind of runs this
           thing, and he tipped me off that
           we might get a better shot over
           there.

           rita
           really?

          

           -99-

          

           phil
           i mean, maybe we should go for
           it. what do you think?

           rita
           sounds good to me. larry?

           larry
           sure, why not?

           rita
           all right. thanks, phil. good
           work.
          she reaches for an equipment case.

           phil
           i'll get that.
          phil helps larry carry the camera gear.

           phil
           (to larry)
           you and i never talk, larry. you
           got kids?
          larry looks suspicious. rita looks on, reevaluating phil.
