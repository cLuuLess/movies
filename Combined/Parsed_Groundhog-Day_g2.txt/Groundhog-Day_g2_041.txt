          int. psychologist's office - day

          punxsutawney's only psychologist is a marriage and family
          counselor at the local lutheran church. his appearance and
          manner indicate he may have some serious problems of his own.

           psychologist
           (not too confident)
           that's kind of an unusual
           problem, mr. connors. most of my
           work is with couples and
           families.
          phil is lying on a couch. his head is completely shaved.

           phil
           yeah, but you're still a
           psychologist. you must have had
           some course in school that
           covered this kind of thing.

           psychologist
           sort of, i guess. abnormal
           psychology.

           phil
           so based on that what would you
           say?

           psychologist

           (hesitant)
           i ' d say that maybe you're -- i
           don't know -- a little delusional.

           phil
           you're saying this thing is not
           really happening to me?

           psychologist
           uh-huh.

           phil
           then how do i know this
           conversation is really happening?

           psychologist
           i guess you don't.

           phil
           then forget about me paying you.
          a discreet little alarm sounds.

           psychologist

           (relieved)
           i'm afraid that's all the time we
           have, mr. connors.

           phil
           wait! are you saying i'm crazy?

          

           -43-

          

           psychologist
           (humoring him)
           not necessarily. if it concerns
           you we should schedule our next
           session as soon as possible.
           how's tomorrow for you?
          phil glowers at him.

           cut to:

          insert - a model of the solar system
          a scientist in a white lab coat is holding up the model. phil
          looks on with interest.

           scientist

           (authoritatively)
           now if the moon exerts a
           gravitational pull strong enough
           to cause the tides, .then it may
           be theoretically possible for a
           black hole or a singularity of
           sufficient magnitude to actually
           bend time enough to cause it to
           fold back ,on itself.

           phil
           you think that's a realistic
           possibility?
          a paper airplane sails past his head, accompanied by a noisy
          outburst of juvenile laughter. we pull back to reveal:
