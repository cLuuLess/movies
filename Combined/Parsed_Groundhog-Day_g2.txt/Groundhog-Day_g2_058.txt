          int. phil's room - night

          phil is making passionate love to a woman in the dark.

           woman

           (moans)
           oh, phil.

           phil
           oh , rita .
          the woman suddenly freezes. there is a moment of silence, then
          she snaps on the light. it's nancy, not rita. phil is as
          surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue.

           nancy

           (cold)
           who's rita?

           phil

           (caught)
           no one. it's just something i
           say when i make love. you know --
           "orita", "orighta"-- it's like
           "oh, baby" or something.

           nancy
           (not entirely

           convinced)
           oh.

           phil
           (corrects her)
           o-rita.
          nancy laughs uncertainly. phil switches off the light,
          thinking now about rita.
