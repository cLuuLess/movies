           in fact, the groundhog's
           legendary ability to predict the
           weather may be more than just the
           german folklore of the region.
           higher temperatures trigger
           hormonal changes in the
           testosterone levels of male
           groundhogs, which may in fact
           wake them from hibernation and
           send them out to battle with
           other males ;for mating rights.
           so, the truth is they're not
           looking for their shadows,
           they're looking for groundhog
           chicks.
          rita looks on, clearly delighted with the report.
