          int. hotel bar - evening

          phil is at the bar in punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the
          pennsylvanian. he looks very bored, drinking a beer,
          unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named nancy.

           phil
           you never saw me on tv-- on the
           news?

           nancy
           i don't think so. what part of
           the news do you do?

           phil
           i ' m the white house correspondent
           for nbc news.

           nancy
           oh , i ' m so sure .

           phil
           ask me anything?

           nancy
           okay, how big is the white house?

           phil
           three bedrooms, two and a half
           baths. looks much bigger than it
           , is.
          nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor.
          suddenly, a bride in full white wedding gown and veil rushes
          into the bar, crying and shouting. a gaggle of bridesmaids
          flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding
          but she won't budge. then the groom, wearing a bad rented tux,
          comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the best
          man restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away.
          phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to
          nancy .

           phil
           good start. i ' m sure they'll be
           very happy. so what do you say?
           you want to play doggie obedience
           school with me?

          

           -24-

          

           nancy
           thanks. i'll pass.
          she gets up to leave.

           phil
           sit! stay!
          he watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits
          somewhat unsteadily.

           cut to:

          insert - a thick book
          the cover reads "101 curses, spells and enchantments you can do
          at home." a well-manicured feminine hand opens the book to a
          marked page .
