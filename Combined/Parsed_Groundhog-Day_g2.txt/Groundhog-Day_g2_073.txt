          int. fudge shop - day

          phil and rita are sitting at a table in a small confectionery,
          tasting chunks of different flavored fudge. rita takes a bite

           rita
           this is terrific.

           phil
           best fudge in town.

           rita
           how do you know so much about
           punxsutawney?

           phil
           i like small towns. i think they
           engender real community more than
           big cities.

           rita
           that is so true! i've always
           thought that, too.

           phil
           no kidding. here-- try the white
           chocolate.

           rita
           oh, yuk, don't make me sick.

           phil
           (making mental note)
           no white chocolate.

           rita
           there's something so familiar
           about this. do you ever have
           deja vu?
          phil smiles. then larry enters.

          

           -68-

          

          

           larry
           (irate, to rita)
           i don't believe it. someone
           bought every distributor cap in
           this town. we're going to be
           stuck here all night1
          over phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, "i can't get
          started with you".
