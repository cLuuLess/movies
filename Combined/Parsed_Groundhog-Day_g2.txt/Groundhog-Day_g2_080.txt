          int. phil's room - dawn

          "i got you, babe" is playing. phil hits the clock radio to
          turn it off. he lies there for a moment, then hefts himself
          heavily out of bed, not eager to repeat the day yet another
          time. with the radio off, phil does the deejays' morning
          routine himself, seemingly for the millionth time.

           okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's cooooold out there
           today.
          phil continues the radio report at his own pace, obviously
          fatigued.

           it's cold out there everyday.
           what is this -- miami beach? haw.
           not hardly. and you can expect
           hazardous travel later today with
           that, you know, blizzard thing.
