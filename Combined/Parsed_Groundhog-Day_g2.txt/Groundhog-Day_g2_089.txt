          ext. gobbler's knob - another day

          larry and rita are loading their equipment back into the van.
          rita spots phil standing on the other side of the crowd,
          staring at her. she marches straight over to him, furious.

           rita
           where were you this morning? how
           could you possibly miss the
           shoot?

           phil
           (at the end of his

           rope)
           i've come to the end of me, rita.
           there's only one way out now.
           just remember/we had a wonderful
           day together once.
          phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the
          back of the knob. rita watches him, then follows at a discreet
          distance, very worried.
          in a small clearing behind the man-made groundhog burrow,
          buster greene and two other groundhog club officials are
          lifting a cage into the front seat of buster's pickup.

           b uster
           (to the groundhog)
           there you go, ol' buddy. good
           job. hey! he smiled at me. see
           that?

           first official
           right.

          

           -80-

          

           buster
           (securing the cage)
           there, little fella.
          the other official looks up and sees phil walking toward them
          like a zombie.

           other official
           hi, there, mister. something i
           can do you for?
          without a word, phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup
          and starts it up .

           first official
           hey! what 're you -- !
          phil drives off in buster's truck.
          rita witnesses the groundhog-napping and runs back toward the
          knob.

           rita

           (shouts)
           larry!
          buster and his aides race for another car parked nearby.

           buster
           jake! call the police, and get
           the word out. somebody kidnapped
           phil. we're going after him.
           come on, tommy!
          they jump into a car, buster guns the engine and takes off
          after the pickup.
          rita runs up to larry and grabs the camera on the fly.

           rita
           let's go! phil just snatched the
           groundhog!
          larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the
          gear.

           larry

           (mutters)
           probably some kind of gerbil
           deal. pervert.
