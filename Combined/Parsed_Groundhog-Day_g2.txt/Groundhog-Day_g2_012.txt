          ext. main street - punxsutawney - later

          the van drives along , the small-town main drag. there are
          cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has
          been gaily festooned with banners and bunting.

          

          ext . motel - later
          the van pulls into the parking lot at a quality inn. the
          announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "groundhog
          day breakfast special - feb.2 - all you can eat - $5.99." the
          parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of
          other news vans. the lexus pulls in behind the van and
          everybody gets out.
          phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.

           phil
           (calls out)
           rita! i can't stay here.
          rita is already helping larry unload equipment from the van.

           larry

           (muttering)
           prima donnas.

           rita
           it's okay. i'll handle it.
          she crosses to the lexus where phil is trying to make another
          call on his earphone.

           rita
           what's the problem, phil?

           phil
           i hate this place. i stayed here
           two years ago and i was
           miserable. it's like a minimum
           security prison. i'm not staying
           here.

           rita
           you're not staying here.

           phil

           (brightening)
           i ' m not?

           rita
           no, larry and i don't care but i
           thought you might, so i booked
           you at a very nice bed and
           breakfast on cherry street.
           here's the address.
          she hands him a card.

           phil

           (pleased)
           great. that's great. that's the
           mark of a really good producer.
           making the talent happy.

           rita
           whatever i can do.

           phil
           really? will you be my love
           slave?

           rita
           whatever i can do within reason.
           would you like to have dinner
           with larry and me?

           phil
           no thanks, i've seen larry eat.
           why don't you ditch larry and let
           me take you someplace nice?

           rita
           you mean like a date?

           phil
           yeah.

           rita
           oh, no.

           phil
           okay. i get it. you're a little
           intimidated by me, you're all
           excited about the shoot tomorrow,
           you want everything to go just
           perfect. i understand. you just
           get some sleep. tomorrow will be
           great.

          

           -11-

          

           rita
           well, that's something to look
           forward to. i'll see you in the
           morning.
          he drives off, leaving her standing there shaking her head.

           larry
           did he actually call himself "the
           talent?"
          larry snorts and continues unloading their gear.

           cut to:
