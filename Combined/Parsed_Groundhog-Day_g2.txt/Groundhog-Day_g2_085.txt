          ext. gobbler's knob - night

          phil is walking around the mound, casing it out. he takes a
          rifle out from under his coat and sneaks up to the burrow. he
          pulls a smoke bomb from his pocket, lights it, and throws it
          into the hole, then scurries for the edge of the knob and hits
          the deck. he lifts his rifle and aims it.
          smoke is now pouring from the mound. lots of it.
          phil waits, his trigger finger twitching.
          a woman casually walks by, stops. she surveys the situation.

           woman
           he ain't there.
          phil doesn't move. he-doesn't care that she sees him.

           woman
           you can wait all night, but he
           ain't coming out. he don't live
           there. they keep him in the
           library.
          phil's gun droops. the woman begins to walk off, then stops.

           woman
           plug him once for me.
