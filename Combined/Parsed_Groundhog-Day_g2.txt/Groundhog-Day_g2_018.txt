          ext. main street -kpunxsutawney - continuous

          there are a lot of people on the street for this hour. traffic
          is so heavy in fact, the pedestrians are moving faster than the
          cars. everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making
          the annual trek to see the groundhog.
          an old bum is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a
          storefront. someone throws him a coin. phil walks by without
          taking any notice.

           man (o.c.)

          a big pie-faced man, ned ryerson, comes huffing and puffing
          right up to him. there is something about this guy that makes
          us dislike him on sight.

           ned
           phil! phil connors! i thought
           that was you!
          phil looks at him vaguely.

           trick with my belly button in the
           talent show. bing! ned ryerson,

           (resigned)
           ned ryerson.

           -16-

          

           phil
           (sorry he asked)
           no kidding.

           to you but i really have to--
          phil starts to walk away,,but ned won't take the hint.

           ned
           that's okay. i'll walk with you.
           when i see an opportunity, i
           charge it, like a bull. ned the
           bull, that's me now. some of my
           friends live and die by actuarial
           tables, but i think it's all just
           a crap shoot anyhoo. ever heard
           of single .premium life? that
           could be the ticket for you,
           buddy. god, it's good to see
           you! hey, what're you doing for
           dinner?

           phil
           dinner? umm, i don't think
           that's going to work for me.
          as they continue walking, phil steps into what looks like a
          shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. ned laughs
          like a donkey.

           ned
           hey, look out for that first
           step! it's a doozy!
          phil looks at him with murderous contempt.
