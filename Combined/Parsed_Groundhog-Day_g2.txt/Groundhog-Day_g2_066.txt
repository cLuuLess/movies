          int. phil's room - night

          it looks like ;outtakes from fellini's "satyricon." heavy metal
          is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and
          women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off
          whatever hit them. someone is knocking loudly on the door,
          shouting complaints about the music. a beer bottle smashes
          against the door.
          phil is sitting up on the bed with angie. he has his arm
          around her shoulder and a fifth of wild turkey in his hand.

           phil
           (more to himself than
           to angie)
           yeah, but eventually you' d just
           get tired of screwing around and
           then you'd want a real
           relationship, wouldn't you?

           angie
           i don't know.
          a big german shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them.

           phil
           get down, brunoi

           (continuing)
           someone decent, someone who you
           respected, who respects you.

           angie
           i guess so.
          the dog jumps up again.

           phil
           down , bruno !
           (still musing)
           it's tough to find a relationship
           like that, especially if your
           time is kind of limited. but you
           still have to try, don't you?
           (the dog again)
           bruno! i told you! off the bed!
          phil looks over at angle who's passed out with her mouth open

           phil
           there ' s got to be more to it than
           this.
