           groundhog day, february second,
           also known as candlemas day or
           the feast of the purification of
           the virgin mary, the day mary
           first came to the temple for
           ritual blessings following the
           birth of the infant jesus, and
           celebrated since the middle ages
           by the sacramental lighting of
           candles. hence the old scottish
           couplet which long predates the
           .american groundhog tradition: "if
           candlemas dawns bright and clear,
           there'll be two winters in the
           year."
