          ext. street - day

          phil is walking through town, still dressed only in his pajamas
          and overcoat, counting the sidewalk cracks, taking giants steps
          from one to the next. he looks crazy.

          a woman passes walking her dog.

           phil
           hey, pick up after your dog!

           dog walker
           he hasn't done anything.

           phil
           he's going to!

           (pointing)
           there and there. and there!
          phil continues walking, counting the sidewalk cracks. three
          neighborhood kids notice phil and walk along, matching him step
          for step.

           joey, mike and sue
           two, eight, nine, forty-six--
          phil stops. he has lost count. his lip curls up like an
          animal as he turns slowly, growling at the kids. they run away
          screaming with glee. phil starts after them but runs right
          into a cop.

           cop
           you got a problem, buddy?

           phil
           (out of control)
           yeah, i got a problem, buddy! i
           can't stand this place anymore!
           i can't stand this street and i
           can't stand the fourteen bars and
           the five banks and the one star
           food and the bad weather and the
           "quaint" little shops and most of
           all, i can't stand anything--
           anything-- with a groundhog on
           it.
          he rips a groundhog patch off the cop's jacket sleeve.

           cop

           (calmly)
           okay. then let's see what we can
           do about getting you out of here.
           you got a name?

           phil
           (eyes downcast)
           phil.

           cop
           phil. like the groundhog!
          phil turns to the cop like a rabid dog, ready to strike.

           phil
           yeah, like the--
           (he stops as if struck)
           --groundhog.
          some big new idea has formed in his mind.

          ext . gobbler's knob - early morning
          rita is looking at phil as larry videotapes his report.

          

           -77-

          

           larry
           (turning to rita)
           the guy's nuts. he's out of his
           gourd.

           rita
           let him finish, then i'll call
           the station.
          they turn back to watch phil's wrap-up.
          phil is completely unkempt, still wearing only pajama bottoms
          and his overcoat, looking even more demented.

           phil
           (to camera)
           there is no way this winter is
           ever going to end as long as that
           groundhog keeps seeing his shadow
           everyday. i don't see any other
           way out. he's got to be stopped
           and i've got to stop him. for
           channel 9 news, this is phil
           connors.
