           rita hugs him again and starts to exit.

           rita

           phil
           tomorrow? wait, aren't you going
           to come up to my room for a
           while?

           rita
           (very reluctant)
           i don't know, phil--

           noÂ·reason to end a perfect day.

           rita

           (deciding)
           well-- we better not.

           phil

           poetry! i've got some books,
           rimbaud, beaudelaire, we could

           rita
           thanks, but --

           phil
           (seeing it all slip

           away)
           please come, rita. it'll be --

           rita

           (definite)
           phil, i'm tired. we can be
           together tomorrow.

           phil
           (getting desperate)
           but there is no tomorrow for me!

           rita

           (adamant)
           let's not ruin it, phil. there's
           no way i ' m sleeping with you
           tonight.

           phil
           why not? rita, i love you!

           rita
           you don't even know me!

           phil
           (grabs her hand)
           please! you have to!
          rita shakes loose from his grasp.

           rita
           what's wrong with you!
          there is a long moment of silent tension, then all her old
          doubts about phil come rushing back.

           rita
           (shaking her head)
           oh, no. i can't believe i fell
           for it. this whole day was just
           one long set-up. and i ate
           fudge. yucchh! i hate fudge.

           phil
           no, it was real. i love you.

           rita
           stop saying that! do you really
           expect me to trust you? the
           whole secretarial pool is a phil
           connors recovery group.

           phil
           but i can change! i really can--
          rita slaps him hard on the cheek.

           rita
           that's for making me care about
           you.
          she turns and stomps off, leaving phil standing there hurting.
