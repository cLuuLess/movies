               int. macguff house - juno's bedroom - day

               pile of neglected cacti festering in a corner of juno's room.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         and i'm like, "thanks a heap, coyote 
                         ugly. this cactus-gram stings even 
                         worse than your abandonment."
