               int. loring house - mark's "special" room - day

               the walls are plastered with framed posters of early-90s alt 
               rock bands. (mudhoney, jane's addiction etc.) mark removes 
               his les paul from its moorings and hands it to juno.

                                     juno
                         it's beautiful. i've always liked 
                         gibson better than fender.

                                     mark
                         what do you play?

                                     juno
                         i rock a harmony.

                                     mark
                              (holding back a chuckle)
                         oh.

                                     juno
                         what? i'm a pawn shop rocker.

                                     mark
                         sorry. i swear i'm not a gear snob.

               juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.

                                     juno
                         what is that, mahogany? what happens 
                         if you crack the neck?

                                     mark
                         tell me about it. i used to play in 
                         a really tight band back when i lived 
                         in chicago, and one night we opened 
                         for the melvins... do you know who 
                         the melvins are?

                                     juno
                              (lying)
                         yeah.

                                     mark
                         well, we were playing with them and 
                         i busted this guitar onstage. it 
                         cost me $800 and a dime bag just to 
                         have it fixed.

                                     juno
                         when was this, like '96?

                                     mark
                         '93. i'm telling you that was the 
                         best time for rock and roll.

                                     juno
                         nuh-uh, 1977! punk volume 1. you 
                         weren't there, so you can't understand 
                         the magic.

                                     mark
                         you weren't even alive!
