               mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family 
               finances while drinking one of bren's weight loss shakes.

               juno enters.

                                     juno
                         hi dad.

                                     mac
                         hey, big puffy version of junebug. 
                         where have you been?

                                     juno
                         dealing with stuff way beyond my 
                         maturity level. where is everyone?

                                     mac
                         bren took liberty bell to her tot 
                         ice skating class.

                                     juno
                         tot ice skating? tots can't ice skate. 
                         liberty bell's still getting the 
                         hang of stairs.

                                     mac
                         no, but you know bren. she dreams 
                         big.

                                     juno
                         yeah, she does.

                                     mac
                         you look a little morose, honey. 
                         what's eating you?

                                     juno
                         i'm losing my faith in humanity.

                                     mac
                         think you can narrow it down for me.

                                     juno
                         i guess i wonder sometimes if people 
                         ever stay together for good.

                                     mac
                         you mean like couples?

                                     juno
                         yeah, like people in love.

                                     mac
                         are you having boy trouble? i gotta 
                         be honest; i don't much approve of 
                         you dating in your condition, 
                         'cause... well, that's kind of messed 
                         up.

                                     juno
                         dad, no!

                                     mac
                         well, it's kind of skanky. isn't 
                         that what you girls call it? skanky? 
                         skeevy?

                                     juno
                         please stop now.

                                     mac
                              (persisting)
                         tore up from the floor up?

                                     juno
                         dad, it's not about that. i just 
                         need to know that it's possible for 
                         two people to stay happy together 
                         forever. or at least for a few years.

                                     mac
                         it's not easy, that's for sure. now, 
                         i may not have the best track record 
                         in the world, but i have been with 
                         your stepmother for ten years now, 
                         and i'm proud to say that we're very 
                         happy.

               juno nods in agreement.

                                     mac
                         in my opinion, the best thing you 
                         can do is to find a person who loves 
                         you for exactly what you are. good 
                         mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty, 
                         handsome, what have you, the right 
                         person will still think that the sun 
                         shines out your ass. that's the kind 
                         of person that's worth sticking with.

               a wave of realization crosses juno's face.

                                     juno
                         i sort of already have.

                                     mac
                         well, of course. your old d-a-d! you 
                         know i'll always be there to love 
                         and support you, no matter what kind 
                         of pickle you're in.

               he nods toward her belly.

                                     mac
                         obviously.

               juno laughs and hugs her father, planting a smooch on his 
               cheek.

                                     juno
                         i need to go out somewhere for just 
                         a little while. i don't have any 
                         homework, and i swear i'll be back 
                         by ten.

               she salutes and dashes out of the kitchen.

                                     mac
                         you were talking about me, right?
