               int. loring house - nursery - day

               mark and vanessa stand silently in the nursery. the walls 
               are primed slate gray. a single antique rocking chair sits 
               in the corner. vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint 
               samples up near the wall.

                                     vanessa
                         what do you think? custard or 
                         cheesecake?

                                     mark
                         they're yellow.

                                     vanessa
                         well, i wanted to pick something 
                         gender-neutral for now. once we get 
                         the baby, god willing, we can create 
                         a more decisive palette.

                                     mark
                         why do people think yellow is gender-
                         neutral? i don't know one man with a 
                         yellow bedroom.

                                     vanessa
                         i think i'm leaning toward custard 
                         in this light. i don't know. i should 
                         paint a small area...

                                     mark
                         or you could just wait a couple 
                         months. it's not like the baby's 
                         going to storm in here any second 
                         and demand dessert-colored walls.

                                     vanessa
                         what to expect says that readying 
                         the baby's room is an important 
                         process for women. it's called 
                         "nesting."

                                     mark
                         nesting, huh? are you planning to 
                         build the crib out of twigs and 
                         saliva?

                                     vanessa
                         you should read the book. i even 
                         flagged the "daddy chapters" for 
                         you.

                                     mark
                         i just think it's too early to paint. 
                         that's my opinion.

                                     vanessa
                         and i disagree.

               mark shrugs, resigned.

               vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall.

                                     vanessa
                         that wall is going to need something. 
                         maybe we could put our first family 
                         picture there.

                                     mark
                         hm.

                                     vanessa
                         can you see it?

               mark stares at the wall, looking lost.
