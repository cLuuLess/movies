               juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a 
               lock around it. in the background, a group of 3 nerds play a 
               live-action rpg.

                         you did not! you don't have the armor. 
                         that orc armor you bought from the 
                         wizard doesn't have the power level 
                         to parry my hit!
