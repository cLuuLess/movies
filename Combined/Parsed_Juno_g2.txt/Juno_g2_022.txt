               int. macguff house - juno's bedroom - afternoon

               juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a 
               distraught teen girl clutching her head in a moment of staged 
               conflict. the ad reads: "pregnant? find the clinic that gives 
               women choice. women's choice health center."

               juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials. for a moment, 
               she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad, 
               checking herself out in the mirror.

                                     juno
                              (talking along with 
                              voice prompt)
                         "para instruciones en espanol, oprima 
                         numero dos."

               she presses a few buttons in succession.

                                     juno
                         yes, hello, i need to procure a hasty 
                         abortion?... what was that? i'm sorry, 
                         i'm on my hamburger phone and it's 
                         kind of awkward to talk on. it's 
                         really more of a novelty than a 
                         functional appliance.

               she smacks the phone a couple of times.

                                     juno
                         better? okay, good. yeah, as i said, 
                         i need an abortion, two... sixteen... 
                         um, it was approximately two months 
                         and four days ago that i had the 
                         sex. that's a guestimate. okay, next 
                         saturday? great.

               she hangs up the phone.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         i hate it when adults use the term 
                         "sexually active."
