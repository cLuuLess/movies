               int. loring house - nursery - day

               the nursery is perfectly decorated in vanessa's immaculate 
               taste. nothing looks as though it's been touched. we see the 
               antique rocking chair sitting empty.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         it ended with a chair.

               we pan past the wall vanessa had said "needed something." 
               there's a framed note on the wall. it looks like it was 
               handwritten on the back of a jiffy lube bill. we see that it 
               says: "vanessa -- if you're still in, i'm still in. juno."

               we move to the door and get a view of vanessa's bedroom. we 
               see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her 
               shoulder, feeding the baby. for the first time ever, vanessa 
               looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. there 
               are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed 
               close to the bed. obviously, she hasn't been away from the 
               baby for a single moment.

               the baby reaches up and grabs vanessa's thumb. vanessa glows 
               with an expression of pure bliss.
