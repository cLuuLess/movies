               ext. park bench - day

               juno and leah are sitting at a bench in a park. they slurp 
               giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of penny savers.

               juno has her pipe with her.

                                     juno
                         the penny saver sucks.

                                     leah
                         yeah, but it sucks for free.

               they turn the pages in silence for a moment. their lips and 
               teeth are windex-blue.

                                     leah
                         look at this one "wholesome, 
                         spiritually wealthy couple have found 
                         true love with each other."
                              (checks to see that 
                              juno is paying 
                              attention)
                         "all that's missing is your bastard."

                                     juno
                              (reading a different 
                              page)
                         there's a guy in here who's giving 
                         away a piano. free for the hauling! 
                         we should put it in bleeker's yard.

                                     leah
                         you're not listening to me.

                                     juno
                         no, i heard you. i just can't give 
                         the baby to people who describe 
                         themselves as "wholesome." i'm looking 
                         for something a little edgier.

                                     leah
                         what did you have in mind, a family 
                         of disturbed loners who are into 
                         gunplay and incest?

                                     juno
                         i was thinking a graphic designer, 
                         mid-thirties, and his cool asian 
                         wife who dresses awesome and plays 
                         bass. but i'm trying to not be too 
                         particular.

                                     leah
                         all right, how about this one? 
                         "healthy, educated couple seeking 
                         infant to join our family of five. 
                         you will be compensated. help us 
                         complete the circle of love."

                                     juno
                         yeesh, they sound like a cult. 
                         besides, they're greedy bitches. 
                         they already have three kids!

                                     leah
                         hey, juno. juno! look at this one.

               she points to the paper and motions for juno to look. juno 
               scans the ad silently.

               we see the ad. it contains a photo of an attractive couple 
               with ambiguous mona lisa smiles. it reads "educated, 
               successful couple wishes to..."

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         they were mark and vanessa loring, 
                         and they were beautiful even in black 
                         and white.
