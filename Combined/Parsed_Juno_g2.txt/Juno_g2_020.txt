               int. dancing elk school - hallway - day

               juno rummages through her locker, which is plastered with 
               photos of leah and bleeker, plus a giant poster of iggy pop 
               in his heyday.

               she grabs a dilapidated physics textbook. a few pages slip 
               out. steve rendazo (the same asshole who harassed her as she 
               walked to the drugstore) passes by in the hallway.

                                     steve rendazo
                         hey, your book fell apart!

                                     juno
                         yeah.

                                     steve rendazo
                         it must have looked at your face. 
                         pwah!

               he high-fives his klatch of buddies and moves along.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         the funny thing is that steve rendazo 
                         secretly wants me. jocks like him 
                         always want freaky girls. girls with 
                         horn-rimmed glasses and vegan footwear 
                         and goth makeup. girls who play the 
                         cello and wear converse all-stars 
                         and want to be children's librarians 
                         when they grow up. oh yeah, jocks 
                         eat that shit up.

               we see steve looking back at juno for a brief second with 
               mixed feelings.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         they just won't admit it, because 
                         they're supposed to be into perfect 
                         cheerleaders like leah. who, 
                         incidentally, is into teachers.

               we see leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly 
               with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, keith.

                                     leah
                              (from a distance)
                         me too! i love woody allen!
