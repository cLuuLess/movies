               int. loring house - upstairs hallway - day

               juno opens the bathroom door and instantly bumps into mark.

                                     juno
                         whoops! yikes, i didn't expect to 
                         see you up here.

                                     mark
                         sorry. i was just getting something.

                                     juno
                         did your wife send you up here to 
                         spy on me?

                                     mark
                         what? no! do we come off like paranoid 
                         yuppies or something?

                                     juno
                         well, you don't just invite a random 
                         pregnant teenager into your house 
                         and leave her unsupervised. i could 
                         be a total klepto, for all you know.

                                     mark
                         i don't get a klepto vibe from you. 
                         evil genius? maybe. arsonist? wouldn't 
                         rule it out.

                                     juno
                         i did steal a squirt of perfume. 
                         what do you think? it's clinique 
                         happy.

               she holds her wrist up to mark's twitching nostrils.

                                     juno
                         smell those sparkling topnotes!

               mark inhales.

                                     mark
                         am i supposed to feel happy now?

                                     juno
                         you should be happy, holmes. i'm 
                         giving you and vanessa the gift of 
                         life. sweet, screaming, pooping life! 
                         and you don't even have to be there 
                         when the baby comes out of me all 
                         covered in...

                                     mark
                         viscera?

                                     juno
                         blood and guts.

                                     mark
                         we'd better get back downstairs asap.

               juno mocks his use of "asap" silently.

                                     juno
                              (halting)
                         wait a minute. is that a les paul?

               juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar. we 
               see guitars mounted on the wall, and the edges of posters.

                                     mark
                         oh. that's, uh, my room. vanessa 
                         lets me have a room for all my old 
                         stuff.

                                     juno
                         wow, you get a whole room in your 
                         own house? she's got you on a long 
                         leash there, mark.

                                     mark
                         shut up.
