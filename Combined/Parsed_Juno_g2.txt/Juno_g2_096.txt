               int. loring house - dining room - night

               vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events 
               sink in. after a beat, mark comes down the stairs to join 
               her.

                                     mark
                         i called gerta rauss. she says she 
                         can represent both of us. they call 
                         it "collaborative divorce." it's 
                         apparently all the rage right now. 
                         and it's easy because we don't have 
                         children.

                                     vanessa
                         no, it's fine. thanks for making the 
                         call, i guess.

               mark nods and sits down.

                                     vanessa
                         we're actually, finally doing this?

                                     mark
                         looks like it, yeah.

                                     vanessa
                         have you found a place to stay?

                                     mark
                         yeah, downtown.

                                     vanessa
                         a hotel?

                                     mark
                         it's a loft.

                                     vanessa
                              (lightly teasing)
                         aren't you the cool guy?

               they stare at the wall, speechless and defeated.

                                     vanessa
                         i wanted a baby so bad. so bad.

               she buries her head in her hands.

                                     mark
                         i know you did.

               there's a loud knock on the front door.
