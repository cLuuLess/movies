               int. bleeker house - hallway - night

               bleeker's mom escorts juno wordlessly up the stairs and down 
               the hallway to paulie's bedroom. juno discreetly tries to 
               charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents her 
               from getting past bleeker's mom. they share an extremely 
               awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway.

               bleecker's mom nudges past juno and knocks on bleeker's 
               bedroom door. the door has a cheesy racecar-themed decoration 
               hanging on it that says paulie's vrrooom! it looks like 
               something a 5-year old might have.
