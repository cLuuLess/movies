               a dog barks, jarring juno back to reality.

                                     juno
                         quiet, banana. hey, shut your gob 
                         for a second, okay?

               we see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away 
               from the abandoned living room set. the dog yaps again.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         this is the most magnificent discarded 
                         living room set i've ever seen.

               she swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and 
               wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.

               begin animated title sequence:

               juno marching down various street, pumping her arms like a 
               jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of 
               juice. we watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia, clearly 
               on a mission.
