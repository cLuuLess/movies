               int. hospital - birthing suite - day

               we see juno is in a birthing suite at the hospital, pacing 
               impatiently, bent over in obvious discomfort. she's wearing 
               her chuck taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown. 
               leah and bren stand nearby.

               juno doubles over in pain.

                                     juno
                              (panicked)
                         ow, ow, fuckity-ow. bren, when do i 
                         get that spinal tap thing?

                                     bren
                         it's called a spinal block, and you 
                         can't have it yet, honey. the doctor 
                         said you're not dilated enough.

                                     juno
                         you mean i have to wait for it to 
                         get even worse? why can't they just 
                         give it to me now?

                                     bren
                         well, honey, doctors are sadists who 
                         like to play god and watch lesser 
                         people scream.

               juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain.

                                     bren
                              (checking her watch)
                         shit.
                              (to the doctor)
                         hey, can we give my kid the damn 
                         spinal tap already?
