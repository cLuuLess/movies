                         so, i've been spending a lot of time 
                         listening to that weird cd you made 
                         me.

               mark instantly smiles.

                         oh really? what's the verdict?

                                     juno

                         cute?

                         well, when you're used to the raw 
                         power of iggy and the stooges, 
                         everything else sounds kind of 
                         precious by comparison.

                                     mark
                         i imagine you have a collection of 
                         punk chestnuts to prove your point.

                                     juno
                         consider it your musical education.

                                     mark
                         i'm dying to see what you've got to 
                         teach me.

                                     juno
                         okay, stop surfing porn and get back 
                         to work. just wanted to say hi.

                                     mark
                         go learn something.
