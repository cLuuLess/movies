               ext. bleeker house - day

               juno bikes up to find bleeker sitting on the stoop. she smiles 
               and takes out her guitar. she sits across from bleeker and 
               pulls the pick out of the strings.

                                     juno
                         ready?

               bleeker nods.

               juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "anyone else 
               but you," by the moldy peaches. bleeker joins in. at first 
               their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.

                                     bleeker
                         you're a part time lover and a 
                         fulltime friend. the monkey on your 
                         back is the latest trend. i don't 
                         see what anyone can see, in anyone 
                         else but you.

                                     juno
                         here is the church and here is the 
                         steeple. we sure are cute for two 
                         ugly people. i don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

                                     bleeker
                         we both have shiny happy fits of 
                         rage. you want more fans, i want 
                         more stage. i don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

                                     juno
                         you are always trying to keep it 
                         real. i'm in love with how you feel. 
                         i don't see what anyone can see, in 
                         anyone else but you.

                                     bleeker
                         i kiss you on the brain in the shadow 
                         of a train. i kiss you all starryeyed, 
                         my body's swinging from side to side. 
                         i don't see what anyone can see, in 
                         anyone else but you.

                                     juno
                         the pebbles forgive me, the trees 
                         forgive me. so why can't you forgive 
                         me? i don't see what anyone can see, 
                         in anyone else but you.

                                     juno and bleeker together
                         du du du du du du dudu. du du du du 
                         du du dudu. i don't see what anyone 
                         can see, in anyone else but you.

               she and bleeker exchange glances as they play. they smile 
               ambiguously. juno leans over and kisses bleeker on the cheek.

               pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with 
               life and summer activity.
