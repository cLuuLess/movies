                         i'm supposed to be running.

                                     juno
                         i know.

               there's an awkward silence.

                                     bleeker
                         so, what do you think we should do?

                                     juno
                         i thought i might, you know, nip it 
                         in the bud before it gets worse. 
                         because i heard in health class that 
                         pregnancy often results in an infant.

                         yeah, typically. that's what happens 
                         when our moms and teachers get 
                         pregnant.

                                     juno
                         so that's cool with you, then?

                                     bleeker
                         yeah, wizard, i guess. i mean do 
                         what you think is right.

                                     juno
                         i'm real sorry i had sex with you. i 
                         know it wasn't your idea.

                                     bleeker
                         whose idea was it?

                                     juno
                         i'll see you at school, o.k.?

                              (to nobody in 
                              particular)
                         whose idea was it?
