               int. loring house - mark's "special room" - day

               mark has the les paul on his lap as he stares at the boards 
               of an awful commercial.

               cu - the script (storyboards). a kitchen scene with a kid 
               eating a new breakfast product called -- brunch bowlz.

               annoyed and out of ideas, mark begins an impromptu song...

                                     mark
                         if you're tired of breakfast 
                         but not hungry for lunch, 
                         microwave yourself 
                         a healthy bowl of brunch!
