               int. loring house - kitchen - afternoon

               vanessa slides her briefcase off her shoulder and ventures 
               into the living room. she's struggling to carry some oversized 
               shopping bags.

                                     vanessa
                         mark? are you home? i want to show 
                         you some things i picked up.

               juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ultrasound 
               photo. mark trails behind her.

                                     juno
                         hi vanessa!

               vanessa jumps and makes a strangled sound.

                                     vanessa
                         juno! god, you startled me. what are 
                         you doing here? what's wrong?

                                     juno
                         nothing...

                                     vanessa
                         then what's going on?

                                     juno
                         i went to the doctor today.

               vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. 
               her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.

                                     vanessa
                         is the baby okay?

                                     juno
                         sure. it's the right size and 
                         everything. i even saw its phalanges 
                         today! check this...

               she holds the ultrasound up to show vanessa and drapes her 
               arm around her.

                                     vanessa
                         what...

                                     juno
                         this is the baby. your baby.

               vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.

                                     vanessa
                         oh my god...

                                     juno
                              (kindly)
                         doesn't it look like it's waving? 
                         it's kind of like it's saying "hi, 
                         vanessa. will you be my mommy?"

                                     vanessa
                         yeah. yeah, it kind of does.

                                     mark
                         juno was nice enough to bring this 
                         by for us.

                                     juno
                         i came over as soon as i got that 
                         cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. 
                         my stepmom verbally abused the 
                         ultrasound tech so we were escorted 
                         off the premises.

                                     vanessa
                              (distracted)
                         oh, that's great!

               she can't divert her gaze from the photo.

                                     juno
                         see? nothing to worry about.

               vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of 
               emotion.
