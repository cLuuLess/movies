               ext. centennial lane - dusk

               juno macguff stands on a placid street in a nondescript 
               subdivision, facing the curb. it's fall. juno is sixteen 
               years old, an artfully bedraggled burnout kid. she winces 
               and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun. the object 
               of her rapt attention is a battered living room set, abandoned 
               curbside by its former owners. there is a fetid-looking 
               leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless 
               latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         it started with a chair.
