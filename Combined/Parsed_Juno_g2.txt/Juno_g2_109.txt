               ext. dancing elk school - track - afternoon

               paulie bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him 
               on the dancing elk track. there's a very sparse crowd in the 
               bleachers. as paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate 
               vijay looks on. bleeker's mom is seated near vijay, holding 
               a video camera.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         i decided to not call bleeker to 
                         tell him that i was having the baby. 
                         he had a big meet against manteno 
                         and i didn't want him to get all 
                         worried about me and choke.

               paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. the fifteen or so 
               people in attendance cheer.

                                     vijay
                              (admiringly)
                         his legs are as swift as his seed.

                                     mrs. bleeker
                         what did you say?

               bleeker pants at the finish line, dripping with sweat.

                                     announcer
                         p. bleeker has just broken a district 
                         record in the 400.

               bleeker looks out at the bleachers, scanning them for juno.

               she's not there.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         but he figured it out anyway.

               bleek takes off running toward the parking lot without 
               stopping to explain. his mother stands up, confused.
