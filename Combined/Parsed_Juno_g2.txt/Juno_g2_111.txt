               int. hospital - birthing suite - day

               juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. the birth 
               is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and 
               accomplishment, a task completed. the doctors have cleared 
               out. mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's 
               not sure what to say.

               he holds up a deck of playing cards as if to initiate a game, 
               but juno gently pushes his hand away. their eyes meet. his 
               expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained.

                                     mac
                         someday, you'll be back here, honey. 
                         on your terms.

               juno nods and swallows.

               over mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway. 
               it's bleeker in his track uniform.

               juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. mac glances 
               at her, alarmed. paulie moves toward the bed. mac clears his 
               throat, gets up and leaves the room.

               paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his 
               arm around juno. she leans into him, letting herself go for 
               the first time in months.
