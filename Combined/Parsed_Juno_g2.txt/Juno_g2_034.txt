               ext. leah's house - day

               leah's front door swings open to reveal a breathless juno 
               standing sheepishly on the porch. leah sighs.

                                     leah
                         what are you doing here, dumbass? i 
                         thought i was supposed to pick you 
                         up at four.

                                     juno
                         i couldn't do it, leah! it smelled 
                         like a dentist in there. they had 
                         these really horrible magazines, 
                         with, like, spritz cookie recipes 
                         and bad fiction and water stains, 
                         like someone read them in the tub. 
                         and the receptionist tried to give 
                         me these weird condoms that looked 
                         like grape suckers, and she told me 
                         about her boyfriend's pie balls, and 
                         su-chin kuah was there, and she told 
                         me the baby had fingernails. 
                         fingernails!

                                     leah
                         oh, gruesome. i wonder if the baby's 
                         claws could scratch your vag on the 
                         way out?

                                     juno
                         i'm staying pregnant, le.

                                     leah
                         keep your voice down dude, my mom's 
                         around here somewhere. she doesn't 
                         know we're sexually active.

                                     juno
                         what does that even mean? anyway, i 
                         got to thinking on the way over. i 
                         was thinking maybe i could give the 
                         baby to somebody who actually likes 
                         that kind of thing. you know, like a 
                         woman with a bum ovary or something. 
                         or some nice lesbos.

                                     leah
                         but then you'll get huge. your chest 
                         is going to milktate. and you have 
                         to tell everyone you're pregnant.

                                     juno
                         i know. maybe they'll canonize me 
                         for being so selfless.

                                     leah
                         maybe they'll totally shit and be 
                         super mad at you and not let you 
                         graduate or go to cabo san lucas for 
                         spring break.

                                     juno
                         bleeker and i were going to go to 
                         gettysburg for spring break.

               leah sighs, as if there's no helping her nerdy friend.

                                     leah
                         well, maybe you could look at one of 
                         those adoption ads. i see them all 
                         the time in the penny saver.

                                     juno
                         there are ads? for parents?

                                     leah
                         oh yeah! "desperately seeking spawn." 
                         they're right by the ads for like, 
                         iguanas and terriers and used fitness 
                         equipment. it's totally legit.

                                     juno
                         come on, leah. i can't scope out 
                         wannabe parents in the penny saver! 
                         that's tacky. that's like buying 
                         clothes at the pump n' munch.
