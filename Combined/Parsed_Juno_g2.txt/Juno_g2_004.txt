               finally, a panting juno arrives at dancing elk drug on the 
               main drag of her small minnesota suburb, dancing elk.

               the automatic doors of the store part to reveal juno's flushed 
               serious face. she carelessly flings the empty juice container 
               over her shoulder and onto the curb. a group of dropouts 
               with skateboards near the entrance glare at her.

               she enters the drugstore.
