               int. loring house - hallway - day

               vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home.

                                     vanessa
                         can i take your coats?

                                     juno
                         sure.

               she takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into 
               vanessa's arms who sets it on a bench.

                                     juno
                         wicked pic in the penny saver, by 
                         the way. super classy. not like those 
                         other people with the fake woods in 
                         the background. like i'm really going 
                         to fall for that, you know?

                                     vanessa
                         you found us in the penny saver?

               mark loring appears next to vanessa. he's a boyishly 
               attractive guy in his mid-thirties.

               he glances sheepishly at vanessa upon hearing the penny saver 
               mention, then extends his hand to mac and juno.

                                     mark
                         hi. i'm mark loring. i'm the husband.
