               int. dancing elk school - spanish class - day - (flashback)

               bleeker and juno are sitting at their desks, listening to a 
               teacher lecturing about spanish. bleeker discreetly pushes a 
               postcard to juno with his foot. she picks it up off the floor, 
               reads it, then looks at bleeker, who is watching the teacher 
               obediently.
