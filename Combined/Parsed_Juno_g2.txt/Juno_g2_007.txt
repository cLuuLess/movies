               int. drugstore - front counter - day

               juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the 
               open test box on the front counter. rollo scans it and bags 
               it indifferently.

                                     juno
                         oh, and this too.

               she places a giant licorice super rope on the counter.

                                     rollo
                         so what's the prognosis, fertile 
                         myrtle? minus or plus?

                                     juno
                              (examining stick)
                         i don't know. it's not... seasoned 
                         yet. wait. huh. yeah, there's that 
                         pink plus sign again. god, it's 
                         unholy.

               she shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the 
               results. shake. shake. nothing.

                                     rollo
                         that ain't no etch-a-sketch. this is 
                         one doodle that can't be undid, 
                         homeskillet.
