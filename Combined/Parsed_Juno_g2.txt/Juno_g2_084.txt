               int. dancing elk school - bleeker's locker - day

               bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. juno marches 
               up to him, belly leading the way.

                                     juno
                         are you honestly and truly going to 
                         prom with katrina de voort?

                                     bleeker
                         um, hi?

                                     juno
                         leah just told me you were going 
                         with her.

                                     bleeker
                         yeah, i did ask her if she wanted to 
                         go. a bunch of us from the team are 
                         going to benihana, then the prom, 
                         then vijay's parents' cabin.

               juno is clearly affronted.

                                     bleeker
                              (meekly)
                         we're getting a stretch limo.

                                     juno
                         your mom must be really glad you're 
                         not taking me.

                                     bleeker
                         you're mad. why are you mad?

                                     juno
                         i'm not mad. i'm in a fucking great 
                         mood. despite the fact that i'm 
                         trapped in a fat suit i can't take 
                         off, despite the fact that everyone 
                         is making fun of me behind my back, 
                         despite the fact that your little 
                         girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in 
                         art class yesterday...

                                     bleeker
                         katrina's not my girlfriend! and i 
                         doubt she was actually giving you 
                         the stinkeye. she just looks like 
                         that all the time.

               a girl strides past (obviously katrina) with a sour look 
               aimed squarely at juno.

                                     juno
                         whatever. have fun at the prom with 
                         soupy sales. i'm sure i can think of 
                         something way more cool to do that 
                         night. like i could pumice my feet, 
                         or go to bren's dumb unitarian church, 
                         or get hit by a ten-ton truck full 
                         of hot garbage juice. all those things 
                         would be exponentially cooler than 
                         going to the prom with you.

               she starts to walk away.

               bleeker takes a deep breath.

                                     bleeker
                         you're being really immature.

                                     juno
                              (turning around)
                         what?

               bleeker braces himself and pushes up his lab goggles.

                                     juno
                         that's not how our thing works! i 
                         hurl the accusations and you talk me 
                         down, remember?

                                     bleeker
                         not this time. you don't have any 
                         reason to be mad at me. you broke my 
                         heart. i should be royally ticked at 
                         you, man. i should be really cheesed 
                         off. i shouldn't want to talk to you 
                         anymore.

                                     juno
                         why? because i got bored and had sex 
                         with you one day, and then i didn't, 
                         like, marry you?

                                     bleeker
                         like i'd marry you! you would be the 
                         meanest wife of all time. and anyway, 
                         i know you weren't bored that day 
                         because there was a lot of stuff on 
                         tv. the blair witch project was on 
                         starz, and you were like, "oh, i 
                         want to watch this, but we should 
                         make out instead. la la la."

                                     juno
                         forget it, bleek. take katrina the 
                         douche packer to the prom. i'm sure 
                         you guys will have a really bitchin' 
                         time!

                                     bleeker
                              (searching for a 
                              comeback)
                         yeah, well... i still have your 
                         underwear.

                                     juno
                         i still have your virginity!

                                     bleeker
                              (looking around, 
                              panicked)
                         oh my god, shut up!

                                     juno
                         what? are you ashamed that we did 
                         it?

                                     bleeker
                         no...

                                     juno
                         well at least you don't have to walk 
                         around with the evidence under your 
                         sweater. i'm a planet!

               juno picks up her backpack dejectedly and slides it over her 
               shoulder. she's about to walk away, when...

                                     bleeker
                         wait, let me take that.

                                     juno
                         huh?

                                     bleeker
                         you shouldn't be carrying that heavy 
                         bag. i'll take it.

                                     juno
                         oh. it's fine. what's another ten 
                         pounds?

               she turns around, wipes tears off her cheek (making sure no 
               one sees) and continues down the hallway.
