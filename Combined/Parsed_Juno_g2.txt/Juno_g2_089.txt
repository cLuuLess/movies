               int. loring house - living room - day

               juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the 
               front door, only to be intercepted by vanessa, who's returning 
               home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased 
               nursing pillow. they nearly collide.

                                     vanessa
                         juno? what's going on?

                                     juno
                         nothing.

               it's obvious from juno's tears and flushed face that she's 
               lying. vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries 
               her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of juno.

                                     vanessa
                              (pretending to be 
                              calm)
                         mark? why is juno crying?

                                     juno
                         i'm not crying. i'm allergic to fine 
                         home furnishings. see you later.

               she rushes toward the door.

                                     vanessa
                         hold on.

               juno halts.

                                     vanessa
                         juno, what's the matter?

                                     mark
                         she's hormonal. right, june? it's 
                         just part of the whole process.

               juno looks totally betrayed. she doesn't respond. vanessa 
               looks at juno's expression and knows mark is lying.

                                     vanessa
                         what did you do?

                                     mark
                         i didn't do anything... i just... 
                         i've just been thinking.

                                     vanessa
                              (you've been thinking?)
                         what?

                                     mark
                         just thinking if this is really the 
                         right thing for us.

                                     vanessa
                         what are you referring to?

               she knows exactly to what he's referring.

                                     mark
                         i've been just wondering if we're, 
                         you know, ready.

                                     vanessa
                         of course we're ready. we've taken 
                         all the classes. the nursery. the 
                         books --

                                     mark
                         i know we're prepared. i just don't 
                         know if... i'm ready.

               juno's face continues to fall. vanessa notices.

                                     vanessa
                              (to juno)
                         juno, don't worry about this. he 
                         just has cold feet. that's how boys 
                         are. the books all say the same thing. 
                         a woman becomes a mother when she 
                         gets pregnant. a man becomes a father 
                         when he sees his baby. he's going to 
                         get there. he'll get there.

               juno ain't buying it.

                                     vanessa
                              (to mark)
                         why don't we let juno go home and we 
                         can discuss this later on, okay?

                                     mark
                         it all just happened so fast. we put 
                         that ad in the paper. i thought it 
                         would take months if, you know, ever 
                         and then -- boom -- two weeks later, 
                         she's in our living room.

                                     vanessa
                              (quietly)
                         she answered our prayers.

                                     mark
                              (ignores the comment)
                         ever since, it's just been like a 
                         ticking clock.

               this stops vanessa. juno looks offended.

                                     vanessa
                         what are you saying?

               a long hideous beat.

                                     mark
                         it just feels a little like bad 
                         timing.

               another hideous beat.

                                     vanessa
                         what would be a good time for you?

                                     mark
                         i don't know. there's just things i 
                         still want to do.

                                     vanessa
                         like what? be a rock star?

                                     mark
                         don't mock me.

               vanessa sighs. it's done.

                                     vanessa
                         you're trying to do something that's 
                         never going to happen. and you know 
                         what? your shirt is stupid. grow up. 
                         if i have to wait for you to become 
                         kurt cobain, i'm never going to be a 
                         mother.

               vanessa looks defeated.

                                     mark
                         i never said i'd be a great father.

               we hear the front door closing. vanessa and mark look over 
               and notice that juno has escaped the conflict.
