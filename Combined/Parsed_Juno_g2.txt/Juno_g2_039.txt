               int. loring house - day

               music plays as we see sparse images of vanessa loring's hands 
               preparing the house for juno's arrival --

               sprucing a vase of flowers.

               straightening a framed photo of the lorings.

               dusting off a table with one of those wetnaps for furniture.

               lining up a shelf of books.
