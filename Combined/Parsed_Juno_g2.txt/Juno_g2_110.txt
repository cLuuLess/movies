               int. hospital - maternity ward - day

               a nurse reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and 
               gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby.

               the nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator.

                                     nurse
                         would you like to meet your son?

               pull back to reveal she's speaking to vanessa, who stands, 
               paralyzed, several feet away.

                                     vanessa
                         i have a son?

                                     nurse
                              (amused)
                         you are the adoptive mother?

                                     vanessa
                         i have a son.

                                     nurse
                         healthy kid, too. didn't waste any 
                         time getting out.

               vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in 
               her eyes. she spends a few moments just looking at him.

               she feels someone watching her, then looks up to see a bren 
               leaning against the doorway.

               vanessa blinks away her tears self-consciously.

                                     vanessa
                         how do i look?

                                     bren
                              (gently)
                         like a mom. scared shitless.

               vanessa laughs.
