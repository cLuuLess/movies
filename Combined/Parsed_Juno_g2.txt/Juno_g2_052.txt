               int. loring house - entry - day

               juno and mac have put their coats on and are in the process 
               of leaving. gerta hands juno the documents. vanessa and mark 
               trail behind.

                                     gerta
                         so, look those over and give me a 
                         call at my office if you have any 
                         questions.

                                     vanessa
                         juno, we'd really appreciate it if 
                         you could keep us updated on any 
                         doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, 
                         other things of that nature.

                                     juno
                         oh. sure. of course you'd want to 
                         know how your kid is cooking.

                                     vanessa
                         so, then, you really think you're 
                         going to go ahead with this?

               mac stares at juno gravely.

                                     juno
                         yeah. for sure. i like you guys.

               juno looks at mark.

                                     vanessa
                         how sure? percentage-wise, would you 
                         say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

               mark seems visibly embarrassed by vanessa's manic demeanor.

                                     juno
                         i'm going to say i'm 104% sure.

                                     vanessa
                         oh really?

                                     juno
                         look, if i could give it to you now, 
                         i would. but it probably looks like 
                         a sea monkey at this point, so i 
                         think we should leave it in there 
                         for a while until it gets cuter, you 
                         know?

                                     mac
                         i think that's a great idea.

                                     mark
                         that's great, right? stellar news. 
                         well, you guys drive safe, and we'll 
                         hear from you soon, all right?

                                     mac
                         all right, take care of yourselves.

               juno and mac exit. mark shuts the door. all is silent in the 
               foyer. mark, vanessa and gerta stand motionless. gerta pumps 
               her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.

                                     gerta
                              (overly aggressive)
                         all right!

               vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely.
