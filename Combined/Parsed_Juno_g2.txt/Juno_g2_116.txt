               ext. suburban streets - day

               juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. her guitar 
               is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. she's obviously not 
               pregnant anymore. she looks happy, but older.

                                     juno (v.o.)
                         as boyfriends go, paulie bleeker is 
                         totally boss. he is the cheese to my 
                         macaroni. i know people are supposed 
                         to fall in love before they reproduce, 
                         but normalcy's not really our style.

               as she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she 
               passes the dancing elk track team, still running in 
               outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.

               juno rides up to a garage where bleeker is sitting, tuning 
               his guitar.
