int. atlanta terminal - hertz counter - day

a shot of willcox hillyer at a hertz counter in the atlanta
airport. a tense, wrought up dave wilkie is in the b.g. of
the shot. during the following brief exchange, hillyer is
politely cool, wilkie under a great strain.

			dave wilkie 
		(holds out hand)
	well, got to get a plane to
	savannah. great running into you,
	buddy. give my best to your daddy.

			willcox hillyer 
	yeah, i'll do that, dave.

			dave wilkie 
		(sweating, tense, under
		 some kind of awful
		 emotional strain)
	ah-h, if you happen to run into
	rose sometime... do me a favor,
	give her a message for me, will
	you?

			willcox hillyer 
		(a trifle wearily)
	dave, i haven't seen rose for
	years.

hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young hertz
girl, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.
in desperation, dave takes his arm.

			dave wilkie 
	buddy, i'm a sick man. i had a
	heart attack last year, i wasn't
	expected to live.

hillyer turns to dave, puzzled and interested; dave earnestly
explains.

			dave wilkie (cont'd)
	you might see her. she writes your
	daddy, and she and that doctor came
	to see him, didn't they? i wish
	you'd tell her something... i never
	could write letters.

			willcox hillyer 
		(in a different tone,
		 interested, curious)
	what do you want me to tell her,
	dave?

			dave wilkie 
		(a painful inward
		 struggle; the man is
		 tormented, miserable)
	oh, to hell with it, never mind.
	don't tell her anything. don't even
	tell her you saw me. 
		(half turns his back, his
		 face twisted with strong
		 emotion)
	got to run, buddy, i'll miss my
	plane.

willcox hillyer and the pretty young hertz girl stare after
dave wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. hillyer
seems affected, less hostile toward dave now. he speaks half
to himself, half to the hertz girl.

			willcox hillyer 
	he still loves her. the poor damn
	fool still loves her.

			hertz girl 
	who was she?

			willcox hillyer 
	a girl named rose.
		(pulls himself back into
		 the world of reality)
	still take r75 to glenville?

			hertz girl 
	yes, sir.

willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.
