int. hotel - mezzanine - day

a shot of daddy peering down at an old pool table in the
mezzanine of the family hotel. buddy stands by with a pool
stick in hand. in the b.g., we see a black bellboy, shadrach,
approaching.

			daddy 
	i see my mother-in-law's face, son.
	read 'em and weep, boy, i am
	playing a spectacular combination,
	a triple. the nine ball in the
	corner! 
		(takes his stance with cue
		 as shadrach walks up)
	read 'em and weep, boy, that's all
	she wrote.

			shadrach 
	mistah hillyer, the chief of police
	wants you on the telephone.

			daddy 
		(about to make his shot,
		 looks around)
	the chief of police?

			shadrach 
	yassuh.

daddy straightens up, sets his jaw, leans the cue against the
table and marches toward the elevator as buddy stares after
him. the camera stays on buddy.
