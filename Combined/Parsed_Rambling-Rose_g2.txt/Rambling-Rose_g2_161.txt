	justice, that's what he wants,
	justice for everybody and
	especially for niggers. and i think
	that's real nice of him because
	black people don't have a very good
	life, you got to admit that, to be
	a nigger is sometimes practic'ly
	fatal, but the wife don't
	understand all of that, she thinks
	niggers are just so much dirt,
	which anybody ought to know better
	if they been on their ass their
	ownselves -- and that is the cause
	of his profound unhappiness, buddy,
	that no-good-mean wife with all her
	southern prejudice against niggers
	and everything!

vitality that leaves buddy a trifle groggy. slowly, he shakes
his head, as enter mother.

	the doctor is here. and brother,
	supper is ready.
