int. garage - day

cut to a shot of daddy and buddy back in the garage. they are
scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the
garage. all daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead
ringer for sherlock holmes. he is in dead earnest about this,
it is no joke and he does not dream of being funny.

			daddy 
		(points to ladder, eyes
		 narrowed)
	see, son? the paint is flaked off
	here, freshly. look at it, brother,
	there is no question about it. some
	person or persons unknown have very
	recently tampered with this ladder.

			buddy 
	well... maybe...

			daddy 
	and there's only one reason anybody
	would want this ladder -- to get up
	into rose's bedroom in the dark of
	night! i am going to chain up this
	ladder and padlock it! -- and that
	is not all i am going to do!

buddy stares at him in apprehension.
