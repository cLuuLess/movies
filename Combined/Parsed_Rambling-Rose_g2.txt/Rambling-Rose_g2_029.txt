int. hillyer home - front hall - day

cut to a pov shot of rose busy dusting hall furniture,
humming as she works. we hear on the track the sound of the
model-a starting, and rose freezes. then, quickly, rose
hurries down the hall toward the front door.

on buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. he
has his hands on his hips daddy-style and his face is
expressionless.

another angle, pov of buddy but closer on rose at the end of
the hall. she is staring soulfully through the glass of the
front door as we hear the model-a go down the driveway. rose
lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. a lovesick
expression is on her face.
