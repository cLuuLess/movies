int. dentist's waiting room - day

cut to a shot of mother, rose and buddy in a dentist's
waiting room. rose is holding a rubber ice bag to her jaw,
which is quite swollen. she is groaning and half weeping in
pain.

			mother
	poor thing. does the ice help,
	rose?

			rose
	ohh-hh, a little. oh-h, i ain't
	never been to no dentist before.
	he's gonna kill me, i just know it.

			mother
	no, rose, he'll help you.

another angle, rose shrinks in fear as, enter the dentist in
a white coat, dr. winton, a kindly-looking, gray-haired man.
we see a nurse behind him. he smiles in a reassuring manner.

			dr. winton 
	nurse says we have a nervous
	patient. now, young lady, be calm.
	first of all, let me tell you, i am
	not going to hurt you.

			rose 
	yes, you are.

			dr. winton 
	no, i am not.

			rose 
	look, you can't kid me.

			mother 
		(rises, takes her by the
		 hand)
	now, come on, rose. stop being so
	childish, come on.
