int. hospital elevator - night

cut to a shot of daddy, mother and the hillyer children in a
hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them
down. daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring
pensively ahead.

			daddy
	rosebud looked pretty pitiful in
	that bed. 
		(sighs, shakes his head)
	i hope she'll be all right, but i
	still think we ought to fire her.

			mother 
	i don't see how you can even think
	of it now.

daddy purses his lips but says nothing. it is obvious the
"epizootics" have saved rose, at least for the time being.
