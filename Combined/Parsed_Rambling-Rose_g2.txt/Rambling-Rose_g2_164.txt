int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

a shot of mother and rose and the children in the kitchen. we
see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. rose has
on a new and modest little dress that mother evidently has
made for her.

			mother 
	you see, rose? now that's the kind
	of dress you ought to wear.

			rose
		(less than enthusiastic)
	yeah, it's kinda nice.

			mother 
	you look very pretty in it, rose.
	really, you do.

			rose 
		(smiles at mother)
	well, you're real sweet to make it
	for me.
		(puts an arm around
		 mother's shoulder)
	there never was nobody like you.
	and you don't need to worry, i
	ain't goin' out no more.

			mother 
	well, there's no reason you
	shouldn't go out, rose... in
	moderation.

			rose 
		(a little shrug)
	i don't want to. when i was lyin'
	there in that hospital bed at
	death's door i says to myself, i
	ain't goin' out no more. if i ever
	get outta this, i'll just stay
	home.

rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there
in panties and bra, oblivious of buddy and the children. she
has about as much modesty as a small child herself.

			rose (cont'd)
		(rather sadly)
	besides, there ain't no mr. right
	out there. or if there is i can't
	find him, all i find is a pile of
	mr. wrongs. i ain't goin' out no
	more.
