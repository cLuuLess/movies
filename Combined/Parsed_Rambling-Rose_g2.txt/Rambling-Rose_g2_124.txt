ext. back porch - night

cut to a shot from the pov of the children, on daddy on the
back porch as the lights blaze on. he wears his bathrobe and
has a big shotgun in his hands. now he speaks in a loud,
clear and very angry voice.

			daddy 
	all right, i have got a parker
	shotgun here and it is loaded and
	the trigger is cocked and wherever
	you birds are and whatever you are
	doing you had better get the hell
	out of here goddamned quick!

a sudden total silence ensues, then a sudden crashing in the
bushes as the "birds" take off.

			daddy (cont'd)
	and do not come back, you sons of
	bitches! stay away from my house
	and home and my wife and children
	or i'll blow your goddamned heads
	off!
