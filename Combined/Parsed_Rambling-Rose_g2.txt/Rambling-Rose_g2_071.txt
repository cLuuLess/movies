int. hillyer home - buddy's bedroom - night

cut to a shot of buddy half asleep in bed. the light of the
lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. the
camera comes back and we see rose in her nightgown standing
by his bedside. she is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.

			rose 
	i hate to turn on this light, you
	daddy's awake downstairs, but i
	have to take the chance.
		(sits by him on bed)
	buddy, please don't tell on me.

			buddy
		(rather coolly)
	i said i wouldn't. 

			rose
		(her lip trembles)
	buddy, i have to ask you, as bad as
	i've been please have pity on me
	and don't ruin me by telling them
	what i did. i know it was bad, it
	was bad and dumb. but mostly it was
	dumb, i didn't mean you no harm,
	i'd never want to hurt a hair on
	your head and that's the truth. i
	love you. but they'd think i did,
	they'd think i was awful, they'd
	despise me and hate me...

rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.

cut to a close shot of buddy. we hear the soft sound of rose
weeping over the shot. buddy is affected, his flinty child's
heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it
yet. he is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool"
and not show his emotion. he frowns, moistens his lips,
swallows. with seeming coolness, very much as in the scene
with doll in which he deprecated daddy's stand at
thermopylae, he shrugs.

			buddy 
	well, i don't know what you're
	worried about. it was my idea, i
	was the one who thought of it, not
	you.

the camera pulls back to include rose. she is staring at the
boy with hopeless despair.

			rose 
	you don't understand. they'd blame
	me, not you. and they'd think i was
	awful, a disgustin' girl, which i
	am, but buddy, please don't tell
	them. please don't. ill have to go
	and i love it here, i love your
	whole fam'ly, your daddy, your
	mother... 
		(pauses, then makes her
		 final and ultimate plea
		 in a shaking voice as
		 tears run down)
	buddy, i know i'm no good, i'm a
	bad girl but i can't help it,
	please have pity on me and don't
	tell! please don't, please...

too much for buddy, he loses his "cool." he swallows and
blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and
squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression daddy
style.

			buddy 
		(very solemnly)
	rose, they could stick splinters
	under my fingernails, and i will
	never say a word! i will never tell
	them, because... i love you!

			rose 
		(sees that he means it,
		 smiles in relief and
		 throws her arms around
		 him)
	oh, buddy, you do love me! i knew
	you did, knew it all the time...
