ext. hillyer home - driveway - day

cut to a long pov shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl
walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. a zoomar lense
takes us toward her. she is carrying a cardboard suitcase
tied with a string. her clothes are cheap, her shoes are
dusty, runs are in her stockings. she is sweaty, tired and
seems very nervous. rose is a very attractive girl, but her
primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and
sweetness. she pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with
the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she
stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" southern home which to
her seems very grand. it is apparent she is badly frightened
and apprehensive about what lies ahead. she is also exhausted
from the heat and a long hot walk in the southern sun. she
blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces
herself to walk on.
