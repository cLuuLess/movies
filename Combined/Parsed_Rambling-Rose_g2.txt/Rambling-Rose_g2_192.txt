int. dr. martinson's home office waiting room - night

a shot of buddy and rose in a rather elegant doctor's waiting
room. it is night and they are alone on a small sofa. buddy
has a very solemn and worried look. rose lies weeping in
terror on his shoulder.

			rose 
	oh, buddy, they're gonna cut me all
	up! they're gonna cut my stummick
	all open, i'll die!

			buddy 
		(trying to be brave)
	you won't die, rose.

			rose 
	buddy, i'm scared, i'm scared!
