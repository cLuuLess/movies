ext. hillyer home - patio - day

cut to a shot of willcox hillyer and daddy as they walk with
their drinks out to the patio.

			willcox hillyer 
	what's all this about rose? what do
	you mean, you heard from her in a
	manner of speaking?

			daddy 
	oh, i heard from her, i got a
	letter from her, she's fine. but
	there is some sad news.

			willcox hillyer 
	what sad news? did her cancer come
	back?

			daddy 
	oh, no, no, she got all over that.
	rose is fine. let's sit down, son.

			willcox hillyer 
	is her husband sick or something?

			daddy 
	no, it's another thing. i was going
	to write you about it, but since
	you were coming down anyway i
	thought i'd wait till you got here.
	what did dave wilkie have to say?

another angle on willcox hillyer and the aged daddy as they
sit on the patio sipping whisky. willcox hillyer is not
disturbed or worried about rose, daddy has been very casual
and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news
really is.

			willcox hillyer 
	the pitiful son of a bitch said
	rose was a nymphomaniac.

			daddy 
	um-hmm, and i suppose that incensed
	you?

			willcox hillyer 
	you're damn right it incensed me,
	the miserable bastard. he also said
	the kikes and the niggers have
	taken over washington. d.c.

			daddy
		(nods somberly)
	yeah, i know, he was up here. it's
	pitiful like you say. when he lost
	rose it ruined the man, it
	destroyed him totally when he lost
	rose.

			willcox hillyer 
	he didn't lose her, he threw her
	away.

			daddy 
	yes, i guess he did. he threw her
	away and it was the mistake of his
	life.

			willcox hillyer 
		(staring off pensively
		 into space)
	you know, i don't know this town
	any more. all this traffic, new
	buildings, prosperity...
		(pauses, almost as if in
		 pain)
	where have the years gone, daddy?
	where is the little town i knew as
	a boy?

			daddy 
	at rest in the creative universe
	with mother, son.

			willcox hillyer 
		(a little smile)
	that's what she would say herself.

			daddy
		(simply, he is not
		 emoting)
	a wonderful woman, boy.

			willcox hillyer 
	it always gives me a funny feeling
	to come home. dear old southland.
	gone. it's all gone, daddy --
		(a fond little smile)
	-- except you, you're still here.

			daddy 
		(matter-of-factly)
	not for long, boy. i've outstayed
	my welcome already.

			willcox hillyer 
	it's funny you would mention rose,
	i was thinking about her all the
	way up in the car.
		(gives him a glance)
	or maybe it isn't so funny.

			daddy 
		(as if in previous
		 thought)
	i'm older than hell, boy. but this
	yankee whisky is mighty fine, i'll
	say that.

			willcox hillyer
	all right, daddy. we have our
	drink, we're out on the patio, you
	have prepared me for it. rose's
	cancer has come back, hasn't it?

			daddy 
		(simply, quietly)
	no, son, she is dead. 

			willcox hillyer 
		(numb with shock, for a
		 moment can't speak or
		 think)
	dead, rose is dead? you mean... she
	died?

			daddy 
	i am afraid so, son. about a week
	ago. her husband phoned me, she had
	asked him to call me if anything
	happened.

			willcox hillyer 
		(in awful shock)
	but... but how? she was young! rose
	wasn't old!

			daddy 
	she was fifty-six, son. of course
	she didn't look it, nowhere near
	it. the cancer came back, i'm
	afraid i fibbed about that. but it
	was very quick, son. she was in the
	hospital only two weeks, and the
	last week she didn't know anything.

			willcox hillyer 
		(in distress, a slightly
		 choked voice)
	excuse me, i'll be right back.

willcox hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across
the patio to the kitchen door.
