int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - night

cut to a shot of mother as she walks over and stares down in
shock at rose on the bad. rose is lying back on a pillow and
staring groggily at her, obviously not quite all there.
frowning with worry, mother sits beside her and puts a hand
on her forehead.

			mother 
	rose, you're very sick. you're
	burning up. rose, can you hear me?
	rose?

			rose 
		(semi-delirious)
	what? wha-at? mrs. hillyer?
