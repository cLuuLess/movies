int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - night

cut back to rose standing before the mirror, sick with
horror. a feeble whimper-like groan comes from her.

			rose
	ohh-hh, ohhh-hh... 
		(match burns her fingers,
		 she shakes it out)
	ouch! oh-hh... ohh...

another angle on rose as she turns from the bureau and stares
off into space, a very badly frightened girl. half-crying,
she speaks to herself.

			rose (cont'd)
	he'll tell 'em for sure, he will.
	oh, lord, what can i do?
