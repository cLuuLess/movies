int. dentist's office - day

another angle, on rose and mother and dr. winton, as they
guide and lead rose into the dentist's operating room.- she
plants her feet and her eyes open wide with horror as she
sees the chair and other equipment.

			rose 
	i'm not goin' in there, i don't
	like the looks of it!

			mother 
		(annoyed)
	rose, sit down in that chair and be
	quiet! we're trying to help you,
	you silly creature, sit in that
	chair!

			rose 
		(very reluctantly sits in
		 chair)
	oh-hh, ohh-hh, lord, he's gonna
	kill me.

			dr. winton 
	you and the boy wait outside.
