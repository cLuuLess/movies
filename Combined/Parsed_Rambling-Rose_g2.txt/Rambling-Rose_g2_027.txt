cut to mother and daddy on the patio. daddy stands up.

			daddy 
	well, let's hope for the best,
	darlin'.

			mother 
	hope for the best? i don't
	understand all this skepticism. i
	thought you liked rose.

			daddy 
	i love rosebud, i am wild about
	rosebud. i just hope she doesn't
	turn out to be a hidden hotcha
	character, that's all. we have
	growing children in the house.

			mother 
	hotcha character. if i had to live
	with your cynicism, i wouldn't want
	to live at all. what you can't
	understand is that the creative
	forces of the universe are
	positive, not negative.

			daddy
		(gently, his irony is
		 mild)
	all right, darlin', don't go off
	into the fourth dimension.

			mother 
	i'm not in the fourth dimension --
		(points a finger at him)
	-- you are in the fourth dimension,
	when you allow skepticism and doubt
	to take control. as blake said, if
	god had doubt the sun would go out.

			daddy 
		(again gentle irony,
		 always courtly toward
		 her)
	forgive my crudity, darlin'. i
	don't understand these deeper
	things the way you do.

			mother 
		(reaches up, takes his
		 hand)
	be nice to rose. she's never had a
	real home.

			daddy 
	you're a wonderful woman, darlin'.
	as long as you're around, i'm sure
	the sun wouldn't dare go out.
