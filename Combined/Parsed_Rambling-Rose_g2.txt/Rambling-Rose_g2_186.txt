int. hillyer home - dining room - day

a shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. the
dissolve suggests that some time has gone by. daddy looks a
bit grim, rose has a wan and depressed expression. mother
looks worried.

			daddy 
		(politely)
	well, rose, going out to look for a
	job today?

			rose 
		(eyes down)
	what's the use, there ain't none.

			daddy 
	mmm. would you get me another half
	a-cup of coffee, dear?

rose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to mother.

			daddy (cont'd)
	it has been three weeks since i
	"fired" her. is there no way to get
	rid of this girl? are we stuck with
	her for life?

			mother 
	she can't get a job, it's a
	depression. and we can't just throw
	her out on the street.

			daddy 
	the hell we can't.

rose returns with coffee and pours it out for daddy.

			mother 
	rose, you don't look well and you
	haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.

			rose 
	i'm not hungry. i can't eat
	nothin', i haven't been able to eat
	since i got fired. i think maybe
	i'm sick.

			daddy 
	god forbid. you're not sick, rose,
	forget it. don't get any notions in
	your head, you're not sick.

			rose 
	yes, sir.

			mother 
	she does look a little peaky.

			daddy
	no, she doesn't, she's fine, fine.
	she's perfectly healthy, don't give
	her ideas.

			rose 
	well, i'll do the dishes, then i'm
	goin' to lie down a minute and
	rest. my stomach hurts.

daddy watches rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward
and speaks to mother, his expression a bit sly.

			daddy 
	her plan is obvious, plain as day.
	she's going on a hunger strike. the
	question is, how do we foil her?

			mother 
	she's just nervous and worried. and
	you would be, too, if you had no
	job and no place to go.

			daddy 
		(thinking hard)
	something has got to be done or
	rose is going to be in this house
	forever.
