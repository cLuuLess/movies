int. hillyer home - dream - cellar

quick dissolve to blurred screen: the border of the screen is
blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. the
shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous buddy
and an astonished, awed doll. they are in some far dark
recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,
murky, cobwebby.

			buddy 
	wait till you hear what happened!
	now you wont believe this, doll,
	but rose came in my room and got in
	my bed last night...

another angle on buddy from below with candlelight giving his
child's face a sinister look. now he has "dracula" teeth and
evil arched eyebrows.

			buddy (cont'd)
	... and she sweated and snorted
	like a horse and had a horrible
	fit, her eyebrows were all
	scrunched up and she groaned like
	she was eying and foamed at the
	mouth!
