int. hillyer home - master bedroom - night

cut back to daddy, mother and rose in the bedroom-study.

			daddy 
	i mean a human investment, rose, we
	care about you, you matter to us.
	but we have innocent and unformed
	children in this house and the
	monkey and dog show has got to
	stop. do you hear me?

			rose 
		(meekly)
	yes, sir.

			mother 
		(a bit overwhelmed by
		 daddy)
	she hasn't actually done
	anything...

			daddy 
		(very firmly)
	just a moment, dear. 
		(turns to rose and almost
		 sadly)
	we can't have it, rose. can you
	behave yourself -- or not? that is
	the question, to behave or not to
	behave, to suffer the slings and
	arrows of outrageous chastity and
	keep your skirt down or to hoist it
	in the light of the moon and make
	whoopee -- that is the coil
	shuffling question. 
		(a dramatic pause, then
		 points at her)
	if you can't behave i am going to
	fire you and i say it in front of
	you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it.
	i point my rigid finger right at
	your nose, rose, and i stare
	unwaveringly into your big blue
	eyes and i tell you... this is a
	final warning. do you hear me?

			rose 
		(very meekly)
	yes, sir.
