ext. hillyer home - front porch

on mother as she opens the front door. a sullen billy stares
at her.

			mother 
	yes?

			billy 
	is rose here?

			mother 
	she must have gone out for a walk
	with the children.

			billy 
		(sullenly)
	well, i got to see her.

			mother 
	she isn't here. and i'm sorry, but
	mr. hillyer doesn't want her to
	have callers during working hours.

			billy 
		(sullenly)
	where is she?

			mother 
	i said she isn't here. now you go
	home. be a nice boy and go home.

gently but firmly, mother shuts the door in billy's face.

a shot of billy frustrated on the front porch. sadly,
reluctantly, he turns and walks off the porch down the steps.
