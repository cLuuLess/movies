int. delta airplane - day

cut to dave and willcox hillyer as the young stewardess gives
them drinks. dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees
the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an
aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to
her. he speaks to hillyer, who is making a real effort to be
polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

			dave wilkie 
	well, i am in the construction
	business, buddy, and without
	braggin' i have done real good at
	it. 
		(with a meaningful
		 bitterness)
	there are those who wouldn't have
	expected that out of me. 
		(pauses as if waiting for
		 a reaction, but hillyer
		 is very silent)
	right now i'm buildin' a giant
	motel unit near alexandria, outside
	washington, d.c. not fi-nance, i'm
	on the construction side.

			willcox hillyer 
		(making polite talk)
	well, that's interesting, dave. i
	always liked washington, it's a
	pretty town.

			dave wilkie 
	oh, it's all right, beats jew york.
	but the niggers have took it over,
	just like every other city we got,
	only worse.

hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but
dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self
satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

			dave wilkie (cont'd)
	but i have done real good in the
	construction field. what i don't
	know about buildin' ain't worth
	knowin'. i knocked off twenty-eight
	thousand smackeroos last year,
	how's that for an old country boy?

dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down
with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant
smile.

			dave wilkie (cont'd)
	ha ha, course you make a lot more. 
		(points at the galleys)
	what's that you got there, buddy?

			willcox hillyer 
		(reluctantly)
	galley proof.

			dave wilkie 
	galley what?

			willcox hillyer 
	page proof of a book i'm working
	on.

			dave wilkie 
	how about that. well, you always
	were a screwball.

			willcox hillyer 
		(lifts an eyebrow in mild
		 irony)
	oh, yeah?

			dave wilkie 
		(unfazed)
	i don't mean that the way it
	sounds. 
		(stares at galleys as if
		 rattlesnake)
	imagine it, a book. and i used to
	know you personal way back when.
		(pauses, then earnestly)
	tell me something, buddy, how do
	you dream up all that stuff?

			willcox hillyer 
		(absolutely straight)
	well, actually, we have a little
	black boy named her---t who lives
	in the garage. he does it for me.

			dave wilkie 
		(for a moment half
		 believes it, then a slow,
		 stupid grin)
	heh heh heh heh, same old buddy,
	always jokin' around. almost as
	much of a joker as your daddy. 
		(drains his drink,
		 grimaces; a heavy
		 drinker, dave)
	i saw your daddy a coupla years
	ago, i was up in glenville lookin'
	at a motel site. i guess that's
	where you're headed, huh, to see
	him?

			willcox hillyer 
		(stares out of plane
		 window)
	that's right, dave, i'm headed for
	glenville on a whisperin' jet.

			dave wilkie 
		(suddenly calls out)
	hey, girl! hey, you, give us
	another drink! 
		(to hillyer, sullenly)
	dumb little bitch, supposed to give
	us two in the first place.

willcox hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at
his temple.

			dave wilkie (cont'd)
	this friggin' airline's out of its
	mind. 
		(a martyr)
	the sons of bitches tried to put me
	in tourist.
		(portentuously
		 philosophical)
	but our whole civilization is
	screwed up, buddy. the heebies and
	the coconuts have took it over and
	ruined it.

willcox hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says
nothing. gently, he rubs his temple. it is plain dave wilkie
gives him a headache.
