int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - day

cut to a shot of daddy in the bedroom. he yanks open the
closet door, looks under the bed as he talks.

			daddy 
	where is he? i know he's in here,
	where is he, rose? his shoes were
	on the back porch i smiling at met
	where are you, you son of a bitch?

in her distress and dismay, the sheet has come down over
rose's shoulder and one of her breasts is exposed.

			rose 
		(feebly, she is terrified)
	there ain't nobody here, mr.
	hillyer! honest, there ain't!

			daddy 
	where is he? where have you got him
	hid? 
		(notices curtain blowing
		 in wide open window)
	ah, ha!

the camera follows daddy as he strides angrily toward the
window and leans out of it and stares down. rose makes a
little whimpering sound.
