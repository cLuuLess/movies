ext. hillyer home - patio - day

cut to a shot of doll walking up onto the patio with
schoolbooks. the camera follows her as she walks over to
buddy, who is crouched down eavesdropping at another window.
she whispers to him.

			doll 
	what's goin' on?

			buddy 
	rose says she's goin' to have a
	baby and she sure looks it, but i
	don't think so.

			doll 
	a baby... and she isn't even
	married.

			buddy 
	that's the least of her troubles.
	rose had a rare tropic disease and
	the little tubes in her that babies
	swim down are all stopped up, she
	told me all about it.

			doll 
	if it isn't a baby... what is it?
