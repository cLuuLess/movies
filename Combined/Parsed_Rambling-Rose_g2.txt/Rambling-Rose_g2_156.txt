int. doctor's office - night

cut to a shot of dr. f. robert martinson, a rather unpleasant
man with a spade beard. he has a superior, patronizing way of
talking and very little southern accent if any. the scene is
his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk.

as he speaks the camera pulls back to show daddy, mother and
the hillyer children.

			dr. martinson 
	well, mrs. hillyer, the girl is
	strong as an ox and that is what is
	keeping her alive. but not many
	people walk away from double
	pneumonia, madam, not many.

			mother 
	she looks terrible, just awful.

			dr. martinson 
	of course she does and i must say
	i'm puzzled by your delay in
	getting her to the hospital. i
	should think ordinary powers of
	observation would have suggested to
	you that she was seriously ill.

			mother 
	she hid it from us, doctor. she's
	afraid of the hospital.

			dr. martinson 
		(a thin superior smile)
	afraid of the hospital?

			mother 
	deathly afraid of it. her people
	were poor tenant farmers and she
	doesn't know anything about doctors
	or medicine or hospitals.

			dr. martinson 
		(frowns in open disbelief)
	a tenant farm? are you trying to
	tell me that girl is a product of
	the hookworm and pellagra belt?

			mother 
	well, her people were very poor.
	she says she was often hungry as a
	child, and i'm sure the food she
	ate was pretty awful, not a
	balanced diet at all.

			dr. martinson 
	exactly, and that's why she
	couldn't possibly have come from
	such a farm.

			daddy 
		(icily polite)
	excuse me, sir, are you calling my
	wife a liar?

			mother 
		(embarrassed)
	honey, please...

			dr. martinson 
		(a thin unpleasant smile)
	it's simply that i find it
	incredible, mr. hillyer. aside from
	the girl's illness at the moment,
	she is very strong, a very healthy
	specimen of a young human female --
	and a comely one, too. she must
	have gotten protein somewhere as a
	young child, if only sporadically.

			mother 
	it is kind of amazing. the dentist
	says she has perfect teeth, there
	isn't a cavity in her mouth.

			mr. martinson 
		(tries to make a
		 supercilious joke)
	her entire mouth is a cavity,
	madam, ha ha ha.

			daddy 
		(dryly, doesn't like the
		 man a bit)
	ha ha ha ha.

mother frowns at daddy and dr. martinson gives him an aloof
glance.

			dr. martinson 
		(with spurious dignity)
	the point is you don't grow up like
	that on a diet of sorghum and
	hominy grits. she got protein
	somewhere, she's a very strong girl
	and i think she'll live... despite
	the delay in medical treatment.

			daddy 
	that's all i want to know. 
		(rises)
	lets get out of here before i get
	the epizootics myself. thank you,
	doctor, for your discourse, it was
	fascinating, no doubt.

			mother 
	yes, thank you, doctor.

			dr. martinson 
		(as they leave)
	i beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? do
	you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an
	animal epidemic?

			daddy 
		(icily polite, from the
		 door)
	no, i mean epizootics.
