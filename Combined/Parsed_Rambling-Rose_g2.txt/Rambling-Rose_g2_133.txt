ext. hillyer driveway - day

cut to a shot of the model-a in the driveway of the hillyer
home. mother helps rose out of the car, but rose can't stand
on her feet. daddy has to catch her from falling. daddy picks
her up in his arms and carries her up the steps as buddy runs
ahead to open the front door.
