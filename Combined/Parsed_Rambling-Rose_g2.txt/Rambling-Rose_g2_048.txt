int. hillyer home - dining room - night

cut to a shot of rose and daddy. now rose is sitting penitent
and crying in one of daddy's handkerchiefs. daddy's anger is
gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now
in a different tone.

he sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly
way.

			daddy 
	rose, rose, rose, you poor
	miserable little child, don't you
	know i love you? do i have to put
	my hand on your body or kiss your
	pretty lips to prove it? you are
	beautiful to me, rose, i've loved
	you since you first came here,
	darlin'. and don't you know mrs.
	hillyer loves you, too, that she's
	already taken you into her heart,
	and that that woman's heart is as
	wide as the blue sky itself and as
	deep as the stars?

			rose 
		(weeping in handkerchief)
	oh, i know. she's so sweet, she's
	been so good to me...

			daddy 
	do you know what a friend you have
	got there? do you know she would
	fight for you like a tiger, that
	she would fly to your defense in an
	instant with all the courage in her
	soul if anyone tried to hurt you?
	is this any way to repay her trust
	and love? are you ashamed as i am
	ashamed? 
		(pauses as rose sobs in
		 handkerchief)
	don't cry, honey, don't cry. but
	let me warn you, damn your hide,
	this is thermopylae and i am
	standing here. do you hear me, damn
	you. i am standing at thermopylae
	and the persians shall not pass!
	now get your tail out of here and
	go wash those dishes, and stop
	crying!
