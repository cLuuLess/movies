int. hillyer home - kitchen - day

cut to a shot of buddy and doll and waski in the kitchen.
doll and waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table.
buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls
across the kitchen, hands in his khaki pants.

			buddy 
	it's pitiful. neither one of them
	know.

			doll 
		(as she shakes dice)
	i think daddy suspects.

			buddy 
	no, he doesn't. not really.

the camera follows buddy as he goes to the hall door,
carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall.
