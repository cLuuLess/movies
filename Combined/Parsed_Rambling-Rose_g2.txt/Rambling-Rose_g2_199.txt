ext. hillyer home - garden

cut to a shot of rose and buddy on a beautiful summer day
walking in the garden behind the hillyer house. they walk up
to an empty rabbit hutch. the hutch is made of rough lumber
and chicken wire and has cubicles for about a dozen rabbits.

			rose
		(as she stares at the
		 empty hutch)
	i guess i'll work as a waitress,
	buddy. i done that before and it
	got me in worse trouble than you
	could know, but i can't stay here
	no more. why did you get rid of
	your rabbits, buddy?

			buddy 
	they're dumb things. i got tired of
	them.

			rose 
		(smiles, touches chicken
		 wire)
	did you know when i was a child we
	had pretty near five hundred
	rabbits?

			buddy 
	five hundred rabbits?

			rose 
	yep, we had 'em in orange crates
	all over. it was daddy's dream. he
	was goin' to get rich raisin'
	rabbits. it was what killed daddy.
	he didn't drown hisself till a long
	time later after momma and lunette
	died of typhoid, but it was them
	rabbits what killed him.

			buddy 
	how did the rabbits kill him?

			rose 
	he thought he could sell 'em, but
	nobody but country folks eat
	rabbits, buddy, and they ain't got
	no money. we had to eat them dern
	rabbits our own selves. every dern
	one, and it took about four years
	to eat 'em all up.

			buddy
		(a little smile)
	well, that doctor said you got
	protein somewhere and i guess he
	was right.

			rose 
	boy did i get sick of rabbit. but
	later on after momma died and daddy
	wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin',
	i sure would of been glad for a
	little rabbit stew. you know, i
	oughtn't to of told you about what
	daddy done when i was a child.
	until them rabbits ruined him, he
	was a real good man, buddy.

			buddy 
	what was your mother like?

			rose 
	a saint just like your own mother.
	she's up in heaven right now, her
	and lunette, there ain't no doubt
	about it.

another angle as buddy and rose walk away hand in hand away
from the rabbit hutch.

			buddy 
	maybe it was eating all those
	rabbits that made you sexy, rose.

			rose 
	buddy, sex don't mean a thing to
	me. it ain't nothin' but a mosquito
	bite. 
		(stops, smiles, puts an
		 arm around his shoulders)
	i'll tell you a secret. girls don't
	want sex, buddy, girls want love.

hillyer home - living room night

a shot of mother and daddy in the hillyer living room late at
night. mother sits with a worried expression on a chair, a
kimono around her shoulders. daddy is pacing worriedly in
pajamas and a bathrobe. he looks at his wristwatch.

			daddy 
	it's twenty after one.

			mother 
	i don't understand it. even in the
	wild days she was never as late as
	this.

			daddy 
	i'm afraid it's my fault. i made
	her feel guilty this morning --
		(glances around, sees
		 something in doorway)
	brother, what are you doing up?

another angle on buddy in pajamas as he enters the living
room.

			buddy 
	i heard you talking. hasn't rose
	come in?

			daddy 
	no, she hasn't. 
		(frowns, looks around)
	i think i hear a car.
