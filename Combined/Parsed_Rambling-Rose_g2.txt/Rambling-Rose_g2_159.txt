int. hillyer home - rose's bedroom - night

a shot of rose in bed in her own bedroom. she is propped up
on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk
housecoat of mother's.
a tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as buddy
sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather
listening to her. it is obvious she is well on the road back
to health.

			rose 
	oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside,
	and so unhappy with that rich wife
	who doesn't understand him, her
	being a southerner and everything,
	and what a bedside manner he has
	got -- so gentle and kind beneath
	the professor way he acts!

			buddy 
	rose, you are too uncritical of
	people.

			rose 
	you don't know the bedside manner
	that man has got. why, it does me
	good just to see him sit there all
	solemn and go pokin' in his bag
	like he's gonna cure me, which he
	did of course. and even more
	important he loves me, like a
	patient i mean, the other day he
	got tears in his eyes just
	listenin' to my heart beat.

			buddy 
	he did?

			rose 
	yeah, he tried to hide it but i saw
	'em, and a little bit he says to
	me, "you know, you are beautiful."
	now wasn't that a nice thing for a
	doctor to say to a patient, wasn't
	it? what could cheer a girl up
	more?

			buddy 
	rose, i have got doubts about that
	doctor and so does daddy.

			rose 
	he's got doubts about hisself and
	that's the saddest thing of all.
	would you believe that poor man
	thinks nobody likes him?

			buddy 
	yeah, i'd believe it.

			rose 
	well, i like him. i used to be
	afraid of doctors but not any more.
	why, he could operate on me any old
	time and i wouldn't even be scared.

			buddy 
	rose, you are just entirely too
	uncritical of people.

			rose 
	i ain't neither. listen here,
	buddy, besides all his vast medical
	knowledge, he has the most kindest
	heart beneath the professor way he
	acts -- he wants justice in the
	world and he's got some real
	interestin' ideas.
