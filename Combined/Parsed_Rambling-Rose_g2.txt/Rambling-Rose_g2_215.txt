int. hillyer home - front hall - day

cut to a shot of willcox hillyer as he glances into the
living room. the room looks the same but different -it is
musty, dim.

willcox hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and
the camera follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into
mother's old bedroom-study. this room is quite different. the
four poster is gone. the room is dusty, musty, dark.
magazines are on the floor in a ring around mother's old
study chair. we see "male" things. it is apparent daddy lives
alone in this room.

back to the kitchen.
