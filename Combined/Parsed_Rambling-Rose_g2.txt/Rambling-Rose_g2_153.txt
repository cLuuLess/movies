int. hillyer home - front hall - night

cut to a shot of buddy, doll and waski in the front hall.
they are badly frightened, even terrified.
the camera pans to show the ambulance attendants carrying
rose strapped in a stretcher down the stairs, as mother helps
and daddy follows, both of them very worried. rose is
conscious now and her eyes roll with terror toward the
children.

			rose 
	buddy! dolly! they're takin' me to
	the hospital! don't let 'em, don't
	let 'em!

the camera stays on the frightened silent children as they
stare after rose on the stretcher.
