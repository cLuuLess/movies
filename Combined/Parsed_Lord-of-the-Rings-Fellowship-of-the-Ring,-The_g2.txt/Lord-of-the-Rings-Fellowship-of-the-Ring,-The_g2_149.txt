strider and arwen stand upon a stone bridge...the evenstar at
arwen's breast shines in the moonlight.

                    arwen
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          renech i lu i erui govannem?   do you
          remember when we first met?

                    strider
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          nauthannim i ned ol reniannen.   i thought
          i had strayed into a dream.

arwen reaches up and gently touches the grey at strider's
temples.

                    arwen
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth i
          se celich. long years have passed...you
          did not have the care you carry now.

arwen looks into strider's eyes.

                    arwen (cont'd)
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          renech i beth i pennen? do you remember
          what i told you? arwen reaches for
          strider's hand...

                    strider
              (quietly)
          you said you'd bind yourself to me,
          forsaking the immortal life of your
          people.


                                                  (continued)
