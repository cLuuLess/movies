          mordor!   i hope the others find a safer
          road.

                    sam
              (simply)
          strider'll look after them.

                    frodo
          i don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

                    sam
          we may yet, mr. frodo.   we may.

                     frodo
          sam?

frodo looks at sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, sam is undeterred...

                    frodo (cont'd)
          i'm glad you're with me.

wide on: the two hobbits setting off toward mordor.
