          the ring is still in your pocket.

bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

                     bilbo
          oh, yes.

close on: bilbo pulls out the ring...he stares at it in his
palm. with all his will power, bilbo allows the ring to
slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. close on:
the tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor.
