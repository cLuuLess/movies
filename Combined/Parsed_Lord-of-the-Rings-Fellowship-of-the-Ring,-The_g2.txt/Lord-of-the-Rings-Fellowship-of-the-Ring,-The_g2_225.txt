ext. parth galen hillside -- day

frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet
thunder down behind him.

                       sam
          mr. frodo!

sam looks around for frodo. close on: lurtz ordering his
uruks.

                     lurtz
          find the halflings ... find the
          halflings!

frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a
tree...above him the sound of uruk-hai crashing through the
forest rings out.

                    merry (o.s.)
              (urgent whisper)
          frodo!

frodo turns to see merry and pippin hidden in a hollow, a few
feet away.

                    merry (cont'd)
          hide here, quick!

                       pippin
          come on...

frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great
sadness in his eyes...

                    pippin (cont'd)
          what's he doing?

                                                 (continued)
