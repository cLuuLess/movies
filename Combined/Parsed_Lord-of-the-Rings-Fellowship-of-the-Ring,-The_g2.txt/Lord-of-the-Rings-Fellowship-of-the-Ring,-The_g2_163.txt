                                                        angle on:

the fellowship clamber through rock and snow. close on: frodo
slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the ring
falls on the ground... close on: the ring gleaming in the
snow! boromir's hand picks it up by the chain...he stands,
the ring dangling before his eyes. he seems to grow in
stature, as if absorbing its power. aragorn warily approaches
boromir...boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as
if transfixed.

                     aragorn
          boromir?

                    boromir
          it is a strange fate that we should
          suffer so much fear and doubt over so
          small a thing...such a little thing.

                    aragorn
              (quietly)
          boromir...give the ring to frodo.
          aragorn's hand moves to his sword hilt.
