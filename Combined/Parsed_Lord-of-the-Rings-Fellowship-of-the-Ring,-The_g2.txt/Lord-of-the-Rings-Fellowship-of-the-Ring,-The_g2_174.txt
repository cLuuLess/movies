int. moria gate -- night

the fellowship step warily into the darkness of moria...a
dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the
mountain.

          so, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled
          hospitality of the dwarves; roaring
          fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone.
          this, my friend, is the home of my
          cousin, balin...and they call this a
          mine...
              (snorting)
          a mine!

a glow from gandalf's staff suddenly lights    the chamber...
the fellowship recoil in horror! many dwarf    skeletons are
strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle...the
rusting armor and shields are peppered with    arrows and axes.



                                                    (continued)
