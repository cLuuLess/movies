int. balin's tomb, moria -- day

gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. dwarf and goblin skeletons are piled high. in the
far corner sits a stone walled well. a shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. gimli falls to his knees...

                    gimli
          no...no...oh, no!

gimli sobs.

gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.
