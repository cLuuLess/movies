close on: frodo...his eyes flicker open...clouded, red-
rimmed...his brow, beaded with sweat.

                    pippin
          is he going to die? frodo's breathing is
          getting shallow. strider looks out into
          the darkness.

                    strider
          no. he is passing into the shadow world,
          he will soon become a wraith like them.

a distant cry of a ringwraith carries through the air.

                    merry
              (nervous)
          they're close.

frodo gasps in sudden pain.

                    strider

          sam, do you know the athelas plant? sam
          looks blank.

                       sam
          athelas?

                       sam
          kingsfoil.     aye.    it's a weed.
