ext. orthanc summit -- night

saruman stands over gandalf, gloating...

                    saruman
          get up! so much for the power of the
          ring or embrace your own destruction!

with the power of his staff, saruman raises gandalf from the
ground, then sends him crashing to the floor.

                    gandalf
          there is only one lord of the ring. only
          one who can bend it to his will...and he
          does not share power.

suddenly! gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off
the tower! saruman watches gandalf fly away from
isengard...on the back of a giant eagle.

                    saruman
              (chilling)
          so you have chosen death!

                                                        cut to:

                                                           65.
