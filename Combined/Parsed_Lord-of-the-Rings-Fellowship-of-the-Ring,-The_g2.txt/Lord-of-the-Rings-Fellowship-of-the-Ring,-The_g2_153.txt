the hum of the ring seems to grow louder in frodo's ears.
gimli suddenly stands, excited.

                    gimli
          then...what are we waiting for?

gimli suddenly rushes forward! he swings his axe down on the
ring. the axe shatters with a deafening crack! gimli falls
backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! he slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. gandalf looks at him
with concern.

                    elrond
          the ring cannot be destroyed, gimli, son
          of gloin, by any craft that we

                    elrond (cont'd)
          here possess. the ring was made in the
          fires of mount doom...only there can it
          be unmade. it must be taken deep into
          mordor, and cast back into the fiery
          chasm from whence it came. one of you
          must do this.

stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if
a great dread has descended on them. boromir addresses the
council in a quiet voice

                    boromir
          one does not simply walk into mordor. its
          black gates are guarded by more than just
          orcs. there is evil there that does not
          sleep and the great eye is ever watchful.
          it is a barren wasteland, riddled with
          fire and ash and dust...the very air you
          breathe is a poisonous fume. not with
          ten thousand men could you do this. it
          is folly.

                    legolas
          have you heard nothing lord elrond has
          said? the ring must be destroyed.

                    gimli
          and i suppose you think you're the one to
          do it?

                    boromir
          and if we fail, what then? what happens
          when sauron takes back what is his?

gimli leaps to his feet!

                                                    (continued)
