          for within these rings was bound the
          strength and will to govern each race.

                                                   fade to black

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          but they were all of them deceived.

fade up: an ancient parchment map of middle earth...moving
slowly across the map as if drawn by an unseen force the
camera closes in on a place name...mordor.

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          ...for another ring was made.

teasing shots: sauron forging the one ring in the chambers of
sammath naur.

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          in the land of mordor, in the fires of
          mount doom, the dark lord sauron forged
          in secret a master ring to control all
          others.


image: the one ring reflecting fiery lava!   fire writing
emerges on the plain band of gold.

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          ...and into this ring he poured his
          cruelty, his malice and his will to
          dominate all life.

image: the one ring falls through space and into flames...

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          one ring to rule them all...

image: a great shadow falls across the map...closing in
around the realm of gondor...

image: screaming villagers, men, women, and children, run

from their homes, pursued by armies of hideous orcs.

                    galadriel
          one by one the free lands of middle earth
          fell to the power of the ring.

                                                   fade to black

                    galadriel (v.o.) (cont'd)
          but there were some...who resisted.
