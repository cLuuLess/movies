ext. rivendell terrace -- evening

sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his
already full pack...pots and pans, blankets, cooking
utensils, provisions, clothes.

                    sam
          no, what have i forgotten? pull back to
          reveal frodo, hands in his pocket,
          watching sam.

                    frodo
          packed already?

sam looks up, startled.

                    sam
              (slightly embarrassed)
          no harm in being prepared. frodo strolls
          to the edge of the balcony.

                    frodo
          i thought you wanted to see the elves,
          sam?
