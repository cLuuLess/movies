ext. gatehouse, bree -- night

the gate keeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern...a
look of fear on his face. he approaches the closed gate with
great apprehension. close on: the gatekeeper peers out of his
peephole.

crash!!

the gate crashed down on the gatekeeper...as four ringwraiths
ride into bree!
