int. caverns below isengard -- night

the dead trees of isengard are fed into roaring
furnaces...molten metal pours into casts...red hot metal,
beaten my sweating orc blacksmiths...armor and weapons are
forged from the great furnaces. saruman strides among the
orcs and stands looking on a new born uruk-hai as it escapes
its birthing membrane...this is lurtz, who rises up to stand
before his master.
