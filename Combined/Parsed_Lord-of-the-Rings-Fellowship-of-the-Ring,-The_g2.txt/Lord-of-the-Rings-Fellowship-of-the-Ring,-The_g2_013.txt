ext. bag end -- day

wide on: gandalf's cart pulls up outside the gate to bag
end...a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole, with a
large round front door set into a grassy hillside. there is
a sign on the gate which reads: "no admittance except on
party business." gandalf strides up to the garden path of bag
end. he raises his staff and raps on the front door...a
voice calls out:

                     bilbo (o.s.)
          no, thank you! we don't want any more
          visitors, well wishers, or distant
          relations.

                    gandalf
          and what about very old friends?

suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him.
he is a hobbit of indertiminate age, with a mischievous
twinkle in his eye. wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he
looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.
