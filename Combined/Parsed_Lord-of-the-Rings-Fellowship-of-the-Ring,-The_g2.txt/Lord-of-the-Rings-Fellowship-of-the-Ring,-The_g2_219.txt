ext. slopes of amon hen -- day

frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. his
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of amon hen...the seeing seat. a crackling sound!
frodo freezes....

                    boromir
              (quietly)
          none of us should wander alone; you least
          of all. so much depends on you...frodo?

frodo turns slowly...he stares at boromir, tense, cautious.

                    boromir (cont'd)
          i know why you seek solitude. you
          suffer, i see it day by day. are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be
heard

                    boromir (cont'd)
          let me help you. there are other ways,
          frodo..other paths that we might take.

                    frodo
          i know what you would say, and it would
          seem like wisdom but for the warning of
          my heart.

                     boromir
          warning?   against what?

boromir has started forward towards frodo, he pulls himself
up.
