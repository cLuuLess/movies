ext. buckleberry ferry -- night

frodo, sam, merry and pippin, are running towards the wide,
placid brandywine river...and the ferry.

                    merry
          get the ropes, sam.

quick angles: stomping hooves...snarling horses...

four ringwraiths are speeding through the fog...converging on
the ferry crossing. the hobbits stampede across the wharf and
tumble onto the ferry.

                    sam
              (screaming)
          frodo!

frodo races across the wooden wharf, followed by the
ringwraiths. he leaps into the ferry.

close on: hooves thunder down the wooden wharf!

sam and merry shove off with the poles...the ferry slides out
into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. they pull up
on the end of the wharf... shrieking with rage! the hobbits
cover their ears. the ringwraiths wheel their horses towards
the north and gallop away along the river bank, quickly
disappearing into the fog.

                    frodo
          how far to the nearest crossing?

                    merry
          the brandwine bridge...twenty miles.
