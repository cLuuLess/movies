                    saruman
          the hour is later than you think.
          sauron's forces are already moving...the
          nine have left minas morgul.

                    gandalf
              (shocked)
          the nine!

                    saruman
          they crossed the river isen in
          midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in
          black.

                    gandalf
              (alarmed)
          they have reached the shire? saruman
          shrugs...

                    saruman
          they will find the ring...and kill the
          one who carries it.

gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door...horrified
as the doors suddenly slam shut.

                    saruman (cont'd)
          you did not seriously think a hobbit
          could contend with the will of sauron?
          there are none who can.

gandalf slowly turns to saruman...a look of dawning horror.

                    saruman (cont'd)
          against the power of mordor, there can be
          no victory. we must join with him,
          gandalf. we must join with sauron. it
          would be wise, my friend.

                    gandalf
              (deadly)
          tell me, friend, when did saruman the
          wise abandon reason for madness?

at that moment: gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room!
he slams against the wall...pinned there by some unseen
force. with sudden effort, gandalf wrenches himself off the
wall and swings his staff on saruman...blasting him off his
feet! gandalf and saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing
them across the room. saruman screams, eyes blazing!
gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp...it
flies across the chamber into saruman's hand! gandalf is
flung to the floor.

                                                    (continued)

                                                            38.
