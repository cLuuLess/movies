          there are many magic rings in the world,
          bilbo baggins, and none of them should be
          used lightly.

                    bilbo
          it was just a bit of fun.   oh, you're
          probably right as usual.

                    gandalf
          you will keep an eye on frodo, won't you?

                    bilbo
          i'm leaving everything to him.

                    gandalf
          what about this ring of yours?   is that
          staying too?

close on: bilbo...he gives gandalf a look and nods toward the
mantelpiece.

                    bilbo
          yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over
          there on the mantelpiece. gandalf frowns
          at the empty mantelpiece...bilbo suddenly
          feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty
          surprise.

                    bilbo (cont'd)
          no, wait. it's here in my pocket. isn't
          that...isn't' that odd now? yet, after
          all, why not? why shouldn't i keep it?

                    gandalf
          i think you should leave the ring behind,
          bilbo. is that so hard?

                    bilbo
          well, no...and yes. now it comes to it,
          i don't feel like parting with it. it's
          mine. i found it. it came to me!

angle on: gandalf looks down at bilbo with rising concern.

                    gandalf
          there's no need to get angry.

                    bilbo
          well, if i'm angry, it's your fault! it's
          mine. my own, my precious.



                                                     (continued)
