                    galadriel
          you offer it to me freely...i do not deny
          that my heart has greatly desired this.

galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before frodo's
eyes. frodo is suddenly afraid of her.

                    galadriel (cont'd)
          in place of the dark lord, you would have
          a queen, not dark, but beautiful and
          terrible as the dawn. treacherous as the
          sea! stronger than the foundations of
          the earth...all shall love me and
          despair! frodo takes a step away from
          galadriel...

galadriel suddenly laughs...a slender elf-woman once more,
clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.

                    galadriel (cont'd)
              (gently)
          i pass the test.
              (laughs)
          i will diminish and go into the west and
          remain galadriel. frodo's confidence
          drains away.

                    frodo
          i cannot do this alone...

                    galadriel
          you are the ring-bearer, frodo...to bear
          a ring of power is to be alone. this task
          was appointed to you, and if you do not
          find a way, no one will.

frodo realizes what her message is.

                    frodo
          then i know what i must do. it's
          just...i'm afraid to do it. galadriel
          kneels down to frodo's height, staring at
          him intently.

                    galadriel
          even the smallest person can change the
          course of the future.

the ring lies in the palm of frodo's hand...his fingers close
over it.

                                                      cut to:

                                                         105.
