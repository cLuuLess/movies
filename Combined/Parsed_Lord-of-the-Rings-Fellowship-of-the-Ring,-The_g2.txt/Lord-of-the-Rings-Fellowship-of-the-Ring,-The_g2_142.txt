          his treachery runs deeper than you know.
          by foul craft, saruman has crossed orc
          with goblin men...he is breeding an army
          in the caverns of isengard. an army that
          can move in sunlight and cover great
          distance at speed. saruman is coming for
          the ring.

elrond turns and walks away...

                    elrond
          this evil cannot be concealed by the
          power of the elves...we do not have the
          strength to fight both mordor and
          isengard...gandalf...the ring cannot stay
          here.

gandalf turns and looks out the window.

sounds of arrivals...gandalf watches as boromir rides through
rivendell gate, followed by legolas and gimli.

                    elrond (v.o.) (cont'd)
          this peril belongs to all middle earth.
          they must decide how to end it. not just
          for themselves but for those who come
          after. elrond approaches gandalf.

                    elrond (cont'd)
          the time of the elves is over. my people
          are leaving these shores. who will you
          look to when we have gone? the dwarves?
          they hide in their mountains seeking
          riches. they care nothing for the
          troubles of others.

                    gandalf
          it is in men that we must place our hope.

                    elrond
          men? men are weak.      the race of men is
          failing. the blood     of numenor is all but
          spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten.
          it is because of men    the ring survives.

flash insert: with the broken sword, isildur slices off
sauron's finger. elrond reacts.

                    elrond (v.o.) (cont'd)
          i was there, gandalf...i was there three
          thousand years ago when isildur took the
          ring.

                                                               70.



flash insert: isildur picks up the ring and stares at it,

entranced.

                       elrond
             i was there the day the strength of men
             failed.
