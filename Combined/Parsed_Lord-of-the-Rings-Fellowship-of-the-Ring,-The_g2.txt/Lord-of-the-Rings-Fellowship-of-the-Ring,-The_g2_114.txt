ext. weatherhills -- night

strider is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing frodo on his
back. sam, merry, and pippin are running to keep up. the
hobbits are carrying flaming torches for protection.

                    strider
          hurry!

                    sam
          we are six days from rivendell. frodo
          groans.

                    strider
          hold on, frodo.

                     sam
          he'll never make it! close on:
          frodo...head lolling about, barely
          conscious.

                    frodo
              (fevered calling)
          gandalf...gandalf?
