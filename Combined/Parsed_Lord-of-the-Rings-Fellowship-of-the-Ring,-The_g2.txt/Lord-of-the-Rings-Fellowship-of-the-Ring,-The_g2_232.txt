                    legolas
          if we are quick, we will catch frodo and
          sam before nightfall.

aragorn looks towards the far shore; frodo and sam's small
boat can be seen lying on the distant riverbank as frodo and
sam make off into the forest beyond. he doesn't react.
legolas turns and looks at aragorn.

                    legolas (cont'd)
          you mean not to follow them...

                    aragorn
          frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

                    gimli
          then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

                    aragorn
          not if we hold true to each other. we
          will not abandon merry and pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

aragorn pulls a hunting knife out of his pack and straps it
on.

                    aragorn (cont'd)
          leave all that can be spared behind...
          close on: aragorn..a steely light in his
          eye.

                    aragorn (cont'd)
              (grimly)
          we travel light. let's hunt some orc.

                       gimli
          yes!   ha!

aragorn, legolas, and gimli disappear into the woods,
following the uruk-hai trail.
