merry's eyes meet frodo's.        understanding.

                    merry
              (softly)
          he's leaving.

                        pippin
          no!

pippin stands and makes a move toward frodo...merry grabs at
his arm.

                        merry
          pippin!

the echo of boromir's horn reaches aragorn, legolas, and
gimli...they are battling their way down the slopes towards
the lake.

                    legolas
          the horn of gondor!

                        aragorn
          boromir!

aragorn desperately slashes his way towards boromir, felling
uruk-hai in his path...while legolas and gimli fight a rear
guard action. many uruk-hai fall to boromir's sword as he
tries to protect merry and pippin...

                        boromir
          run!   run!

lurtz takes aim. a black arrow suddenly thuds into boromir's
chest. amazingly, boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. merry and
pippin are scooped off their feet by uruk-hai.

                        merry & pippin
          aaaaagh!      boromir! boromir!

lurtz aims his bow at boromir's heart... suddenly aragorn
charges at him, smashing the bow with his sword. they lock
into a deadly battle. aragorn cuts lurtz down and races
towards boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...uruk-hai
arrows sticking out of his chest. at least 20 dead uruk-hai
lie heaped around boromir. his horn lies at his feet...cloven
in two.

                    boromir
              (painful gasp)
          they took the little ones...
                    (more)
