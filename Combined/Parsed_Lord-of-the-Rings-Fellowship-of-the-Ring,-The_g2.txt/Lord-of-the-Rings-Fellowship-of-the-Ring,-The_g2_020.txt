          it is in the ground.

merry fearfully tosses the rocket to pippin!    the fuse
sizzles angrily.

                     merry
          outside!

                    pippin
          it was your idea.

pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to merry.
whoosh! the two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. the rocket zooms over the party..it suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden dragon! fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and flies low
towards the startled crowd. close on: frodo watches the
fireworks dragon with alarm...but bilbo is oblivious to the
panicking crowd and impending danger!

                     frodo
          bilbo!   watch out for the dragon!!

                    bilbo
          dragon? nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon
          in these parts for a thousand years!

angle on: frodo

as he hurriedly pulls bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. the fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
this gets the biggest cheer of the night.

angle on: merry and pippin,

clothes and hair smoking.

                    merry
          that was good!

                    pippin
          let's get another one!

large hands suddenly clamp down on merry and pippin's ears.
low angle: gandalf looking down sternly!
