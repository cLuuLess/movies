                    bilbo (v.o.)
          it's mine, my own, my precious.

                    gandalf
              (to himself)
          riddles in the dark.

                    frodo (o.s.)
          bilbo! bilbo!

frodo rushes into bag end...he stops and picks up the ring at
his feet. gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if
locked in thought.

                    gandalf
              (to himself)
          my precious...precious..

                    frodo
              (quietly)
          he's gone, hasn't he? frodo steps into
          the living room.

                    frodo (cont'd)
          he talked for so long about leaving...i
          didn't think he'd really do it.

                     gandalf
              (mutters to himself)
          ...my own.

                     frodo
          gandalf?

gandalf turns...his eyes locking onto the ring in frodo's
fingers.

                    gandalf
          bilbo's ring.

gandalf sorts hurriedly through bilbo's papers...

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          he's gone to stay with the elves. he's
          left you bag end...

gandalf holds out the envelope...frodo drops the ring into
it.

                    gandalf (cont'd)
          ...along with all his possessions.

gandolf seals the envelope with wax.   he hands it to frodo.

                                                    (continued)
