frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. frodo's half-
conscious pov: surreal impression...a shimmering figure in
white leaps off a horse.

flash insert: an ethereal vision of arwen, as she appears on
the other side...

                      arwen
                (elvish: with sub titles)
            frodo, im arwen...telin let thaed. i am
            arwen, i have come here to help you.

            my voice, come back to the light. frodo's
            eyes close.

                      pippin
            who is she?

                      arwen
                (worried)
            frodo?

                      sam
            she's an elf.

                                                            60.



angle on: arwen

who now appears in her earth bound form, a young elven woman
with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes.

                    arwen
          he's fading...he's not gong to last. we
          must get him to my father. strider
          quickly lifts frodo...placing him on the
          horse.

                    arwen (cont'd)
          i have been looking for you for two days.

                    pippin
          where are you taking him?

                    arwen
          there are five wraiths behind you, where
          the other four are, i do not know.

                    strider
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          dartho guin berian...rych le ad
          tolthathon. stay with the hobbits...i'11
          send horses for you. close on: arwen
          grabbing the reins of the horse.

                    arwen
              (elvish: w/subtitles)
          hon mabathon. rochoh ellint im. i'll
          take him. i'm the faster rider. strider
          clamps his hand over arwen's.

                    strider
              (elvish:subtitles)
          andelu i ven. the road is too dangerous.

                    arwen
              (elvish: subtitles)
          frodo fir. ae anthradon i hir, tur
          gwaith nin beriatha hon. if i can cross
          the river, the power of my people can
          protect him.

                    pippin
          what are they saying?

close on: arwen reaches for strider's hand...looking deep
into his eyes.

                    arwen
          i do not fear them.

                                                 (continued)

                                                             61.
