ext. hobbiton fields -- day

wide on: the cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by

hobbits.

                     frodo
           what news of the outside world? tell me
           everything!

                                                       angle on:

gandalf looks down at frodo, a twinkle in his eye.

                     gandalf
           what, everything? far too eager and
           curious for a hobbit. most unnatural...

wide on: the cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy
hobbit marketplace.

                      gandalf (v.o.) (cont'd)
           well, what can i tell you? life in the
           wide world goes on much as if it has past
           age. full of its own comings and goings,
           scarcely even aware of the existence of
           hobbits...

close on: gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before
him.

                     gandalf (cont'd)
           ...for which i am very thankful.

                                                       angle on:

hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the
cart bearing gandalf and frodo rolls past the green dragon
inn...towards... wide on: the party field. where scorcs of
hobbits are busy preparing for the big night.

                     gandalf (cont'd)
           ah, the long expected party. so, how is
           the old rascal? i hear it's going to be
           a party of special magnificence.

                     frodo
           you know bilbo...he's got he whole place
           in an uproar.

                     gandalf
           oh, well...that should please him.


                                                     (continued)

                                                              9.
