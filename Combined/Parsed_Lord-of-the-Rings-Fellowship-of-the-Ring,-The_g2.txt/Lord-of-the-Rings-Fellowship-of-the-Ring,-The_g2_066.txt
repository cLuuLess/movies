ext. isengard gardens -- day

gandalf and saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees
of isengard, saruman's clean, white robe contrasts with
gandalf's dusty grey robes.

                    saruman

                    gandalf

                     saruman
          time?   what time do you think we have?
