          the doom of man!

                    boromir
          it is a gift...a gift to the foes of
          mordor! why not use this ring? long has
          my father, the steward of gondor, held
          the forces of mordor at bay...by the
          blood of our people are your lands kept
          safe. give gondor the weapon of the
          enemy...let us use it against him!

                    strider
          you cannot wield it. none of us can.
          the one ring answers to sauron alone...it
          has no other master. boromir turns and
          looks at strider, coolly.

                    boromir
          and what would a ranger know of this
          matter?

strider says nothing and boromir turns away dismissively.
legolas stands...

                    legolas
          this is no mere ranger. he is aragorn,
          son of arathorn. you owe him your
          allegiance.

frodo looks at strider questioningly...boromir turns sharply.

                    boromir
              (quiet disbelief)
          aragorn? this is isildur's heir?

                    legolas
          and heir to the throne of gondor.

                    aragorn
              (elvish: with subtitles)
          havo dad, legolas...sit down, legolas..

                    boromir
          gondor needs no king.

                    gandalf
          aragorn is right...we cannot use it.

                    elrond
          you have only one choice..the ring must
          be destroyed.

                                                    (continued)
