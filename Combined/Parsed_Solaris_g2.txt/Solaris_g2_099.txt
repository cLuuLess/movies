int.  kelvin's room

on the prometheus.  kelvin looks over to rheya.

                    kelvin
          where did you go before?

                    rheya
          when?

                    kelvin
          last night.  you were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    rheya
          you must have been dreaming.

she begins to cry.

                    kelvin
          what's the matter?

she just shakes her head.

                    kelvin
          rheya?

from kelvin's point of view: rheya, in the chair, crying.

then he looks right to see: rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  she moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

kelvin

sweating.  struggling.  beyond fear.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          i'm losing my mind.
              (beat)
          i'm breaking apart.
