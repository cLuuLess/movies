int.  apartment - night

rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    kelvin
          i used to watch you undress.

as she does:

                    kelvin
          i never tired of watching you
          undress.  every time, it was
          exciting.  right until... to the
          end.

a beat.  then a shot of kelvin that we've seen before: him
leaving their apartment, angry.

on the prometheus

a beat.

                    rheya
          what happened to us, exactly?

                    kelvin
          you don't know?

rheya shakes her head.

kelvin just watches her.

                    rheya
          i remember... something burning. 
          coffee burning.
