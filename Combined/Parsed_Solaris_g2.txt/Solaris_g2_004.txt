int.  cabin - day

the contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  behind
him is the well-dressed bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: a woman in her 50s and a man in his 30s.  they are
also well-groomed.  each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive logo of some sort that composes the
acronym dba.

kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized video image appears on his screen: a man, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

the man, gibarian, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
the lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 hrs 11/14/31.

          we take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  we're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  but our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  we don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          earth to the cosmos.  we are only
          seeking man.  we don't want other
          worlds.  we want mirrors.
              (beat)
          maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

kelvin sits back.

the visitors exchange glances.
