int.  kelvin's room

kelvin puts rheya on the bed.  her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  he stands, still looking at her.  snow seems
very detached.

an uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    kelvin
          she's dead.

snow says nothing.

then:

her finger twitches.

barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  she is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    snow
          she'll come back, don't worry.  but
          then what?  my theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

kelvin is still looking at rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    snow
          why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  it's the most
          obvious solution: escape.  she
          knows she can't leave here --

                    kelvin
          get out --

                    snow
          oh, this one you love?  what about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  you didn't
          love her?

rheya is shaking much harder now, kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  he stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    snow
          what happens if she comes back?  is
          that polygamy?  and even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  you think they're
          not going to notice her?

rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    snow
          i never get used to them, these...
          "resurrections".

he leaves.

rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  she spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

she gradually begins to open her eyes.  she looks at kelvin.

it takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  she should be dead.

she begins to cry.

                    rheya
          what am i?  why can't i die?

she turns away.

                    rheya
          i'm not rheya.  you're always known
          that.

                    kelvin
          rheya --

                    rheya
          don't call me that.

he turns her over.

                    kelvin
          listen: i don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          you are her, you are rheya.

                    rheya
          i'm disgusting.

                    kelvin
          no.

                    rheya
          you're lying.  i'm not human.

                    kelvin
          rheya, i am not going back.  i'm
          staying here with you.

                    rheya
          then you'll die.

                    kelvin
          i want every second i can get with
          you.

a beat.

                    rheya
          what will i do, if you die?

he doesn't know.

                                                  cut to:
