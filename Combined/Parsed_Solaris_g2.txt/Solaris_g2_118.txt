kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  as he nears, his
labrodor recognizes him and approaches.

kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          i will not... give myself.  i will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because i am haunted by the
          idea that i remembered her wrong. 
          that i shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  that i was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          what if i was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          i've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.
