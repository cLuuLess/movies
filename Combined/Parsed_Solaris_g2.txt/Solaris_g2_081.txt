int.  kelvin's room

rheya and kelvin.

                    rheya
          what do i have to do to stop it?

                    kelvin
          i want you here.

                    rheya
          you're lying.

                    kelvin
          you exist here.  i keep telling
          you.

                    rheya
          that's impossible.  i'm not rheya.

                    kelvin
          who are you, then?

                    rheya
          i... i am rheya.  but i am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    kelvin
          yes, you are --

                    rheya
          did you hear what gibarian said? 
          i'm not a human being.  i'm an
          instrument.  i came from your
          memory and your imagination and i
          will torture you no matter what.
          even if i remain passive.  that's
          when i drank the...
              (beat)
          i was going mad.  it felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  there was something else. 
          an illusion.  but i could feel my
          heart beating, and i remembered you
          tested my blood.  is it like yours?

                    kelvin
          yes.  i told you.  it was exactly
          like mine.

                    rheya
          but then i would be dead now.

a beat.

                    kelvin
          is that really what you want?

                    rheya
          i want to stop taking those pills.

                    kelvin
          i wish you wouldn't.

                    rheya
          they do something to me.  it's hard
          to think straight.

                    kelvin
          i think they help.

                    rheya
          i have consciousness, but i am not
          mortal.  don't you see why i'm
          going crazy?

                    kelvin
          you have to remember that i love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    rheya
          i can't --

                    kelvin
          it put you here.  i'll admit it, it
          acted like a god and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          i was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  i saw your mouth.  and
          there you were.
              (beat)
          whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  the decision we
          make now is all that matters.  stay
          with me.

                    rheya
          am i really her?

                    kelvin
          i don't know anymore.  all i see is
          you.

they kiss.

                    kelvin
          stay with me.
              (beat)
          stay with me.

                                                  cut to:
