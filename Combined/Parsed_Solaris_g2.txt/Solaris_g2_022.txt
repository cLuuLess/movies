int.  conference room

before kelvin's arrival.

gibarian is talking to snow and sartorius.

                    gibarian
          a pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  my view is
          that solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  i think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          it hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  from the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the universe.
          and now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the universe, with us as the
          cast.

we now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by kelvin.

                    gibarian
          it's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    snow
          it's god.

                    sartorius
          i don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    gibarian
          nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    sartorius
          what if this thing follows us back
          to earth?  what if what's happening
          here started happening on earth, on
          a mass scale?  don't you see that
          as a problem?  i think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  for all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

gibarian considers this.

                    snow
          we're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

another video

this time, gibarian alone.  near the end.

                    gibarian
          maybe it's stuck.  maybe its power
          isn't that god-like.  i mean, we
          have god-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the earth around at will.
          maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          we intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  of course
          it was beyond our understanding.
              (beat)
          i've come to hate it here.  there's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  humans.
