int.  party - night

rheya enters, looks around.  she spots kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  he approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    kelvin
          "and death shall have no dominion".

                    rheya
          book?

                    kelvin
          poem.  dylan thomas.  i thought of
          it when i saw you on the train.

                    rheya
          my thomas is a little rusty.

he leans over and whispers into her ear.  she listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
genuinely intrigued.  he smiles.

                    rheya
          not a very happy poem.

                    kelvin
          you didn't look very happy.

                    rheya
          i wasn't.

                    kelvin
          and tonight?

                    rheya
          better.

he nods, and they smile.  they seem to be rooting for each
other.  after an extended pleasurable moment, rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  he listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    kelvin
          that's good to know.
