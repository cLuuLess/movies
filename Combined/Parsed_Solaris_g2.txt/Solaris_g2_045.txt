int.  apartment - day

kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

rheya (on prometheus)

her eyes fill with tears.  kelvin embraces her.

                    kelvin
          i'm sorry.  i'm sorry.

rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    rheya
          why did you say those things?

                    kelvin
          i don't know.  i couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.
