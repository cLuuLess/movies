int.  friend's apartment - night

another night.

rheya is wound up.  not drunk, something else.  she has an
odd look in her eyes.

we are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    rheya
          you want to fuck her?

                    kelvin
          stop it.

                    rheya
          you behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    kelvin
          rheya.  not here.

                    rheya
          and i just want to know if i'm
          crazy or not -- if what i think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          or am i one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

                    kelvin
          let's go home.

                    rheya
          you go home.

                    kelvin
          i am.  please come with me.  i
          don't want to do this here.

                    rheya
          you talk like an actor.
