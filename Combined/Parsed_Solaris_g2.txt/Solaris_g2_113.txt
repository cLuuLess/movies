complete chaos.

kelvin is chasing sartorius to the flight deck.

                    sartorius
              (yelling as he runs)
          it's changing characteristics. 
          it's solidifying taking on weight.

                    kelvin
          how quickly?

                    sartorius
          if it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.
