int.  kelvin's room

kelvin on the bed with rheya.  their eyes are closed.

we think they are asleep until:

                    rheya
          you don't want me.

                    kelvin
          rheya.

                    rheya
          that's what you were saying.  i
          heard what you were saying.

                    kelvin
          for a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  that's all i know right
          now.

she realizes she doesn't want to argue.  not right now,
anyway.

                    rheya
          i have these strange thoughts, i
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          i can't explain it.

                    kelvin
          neither can i.  not any of it. 
          there's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  it's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          universe; a gap.  there is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    rheya
          but that's what happened before.

                    kelvin
          not this time.

he kisses her.  she wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  then:

                    rheya
          do you want to stay here?

                    kelvin
          do you?

                    rheya
          if you're here.

they kiss again...

                                             dissolve to:
