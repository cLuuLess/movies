int.  kelvin's room

kelvin and rheya sit together in the prometheus.  rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    rheya
          scared.  no, not scared.  wary. 
          like i was something to be... her
          guard went up.  i was a threat. 
          now i know why.  she was afraid
          she'd be seen.  that i would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  i think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  but that's the
          cycle, right?  i knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          i guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    kelvin
          i know.  i know.  we don't have to
          talk about that.

another beat.

                    rheya
          i remember days of just thinking
          about you.
