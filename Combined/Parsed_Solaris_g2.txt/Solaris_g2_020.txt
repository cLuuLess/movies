int.  docking bay

kelvin leads rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  they are
in space suits.

                    rheya
          we're taking a flight?

                    kelvin
          yes.

he opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
she is unsure.

                    kelvin
          go ahead.  i'll close the door
          behind me.

she stares up and into the pod.  kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then closes the door behind rheya.

he walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

kelvin

in agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

rheya

her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

kelvin

collapses to the ground, shattered.
