int.  room

a figure, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
kelvin enter.  this is snow.  he looks kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    kelvin
          snow.  didn't you hear me radio? 
          i'm kelvin.

a long beat.  snow just watches him.

                    snow
          yes.  we heard.

kelvin takes a step forward, and snow recoils.

                    kelvin
          what's wrong?  what happened to
          gibarian?

                    snow
          he's dead.

                    kelvin
          how?

a beat.

                    snow
          suicide.

snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    snow
          you didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    kelvin
          what?

                    snow
              (musing)
          i love chocolate.  i realized just
          yesterday how much i love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          i thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, i've been thinking about it.

a long beat as kelvin stares at snow.

                    kelvin
          what happened here?

snow lies back in his bunk.

                    snow
          i can't talk just now.  i'm too
          tired.

                    kelvin
          where's sartorius?

                    snow
          in his lab.  he won't let you in.

                    kelvin
              (leaving)
          he'll let me in.

                    snow
          kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    snow
          ... try to stay calm.

                                                  cut to:
