int.  offices - day

intercut kelvin and rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  there is no sound.  as we see these
images, it's clear that kelvin and rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

and they like it.

                    rheya
          thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  i loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    kelvin
          i did too.
