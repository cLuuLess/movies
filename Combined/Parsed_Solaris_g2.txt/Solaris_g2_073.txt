                    rheya
          don't do this.  i am literally
          begging you not to do this.  chris.

                    kelvin
          you should have told me.

                    rheya
          it wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    kelvin
          thank you.

                    rheya
          chris, i had to.  i had to.  i
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    kelvin
          neither did i.

                    rheya
          you never said you wanted one.

                    kelvin
          i never said i didn't.

                    rheya
          chris --

                    kelvin
          i can't stay here.

                    rheya
          chris, please.  chris, i'm serious. 
          i won't make it.

                    kelvin
          then you won't make it.
