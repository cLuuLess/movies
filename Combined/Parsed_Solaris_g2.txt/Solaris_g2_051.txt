int.  kelvin's room

kelvin is eating with rheya.  looking at her.  desiring her.

                    rheya
          do you have any idea how much i
          like fucking you?

                    kelvin
          i think so.

                    rheya
          good.  because i want you to know. 
          i really like fucking you.

he leans over and whispers in her ear.  she smiles and leans
back.

                    rheya
          i like that too.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          how could she not be real?  i can
          smell her, taste her.  she does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    rheya
              (smiles, teasing)
          you know, i've decided: i'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  you must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          great big problems all day.

he just stares at her -- he really likes this.  it's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    kelvin (v.o.)
          like i said, it's not possible.

a beat.

                    rheya
          so, chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

they laugh.

                                                  cut to:
