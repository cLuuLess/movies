rheya is taking her pills.  kelvin watches.

                    kelvin
          what do you remember?

                    rheya
          what do you mean?

                    kelvin
          do you remember beethoven?  the
          beatles?  movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    rheya
              (thinking)
          yes.  but not until you mentioned
          them.  as soon as you said those
          things, i remembered them.  and
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things i remember. 
          it's like filling up.

she looks out the portal at solaris.

                    rheya
          is it a planet?

                    kelvin
          not exactly.  it exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the universe.  an
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          it was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          universe, space, or space-time.  it
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          we had to unlearn everything.

                    rheya
          is it intelligent?

                    kelvin
          intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    rheya
          then it's god, right?

                    kelvin
          it's something.

                    rheya
          you still don't believe in god?

                    kelvin
          the whole idea of god was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called man.  even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  it
          can do this, it can do that!  it
          designs, it creates!

                    rheya
          even a god that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    kelvin
          you're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  you're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  how could we know what
          solaris is up to, if anything?

a beat.

                    rheya
          but what if solaris is what there
          was before the big bang?

                    kelvin
          as i said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    rheya
          as i said, then it's god, right?

she looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    rheya
          why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

kelvin smiles.

the intercom comes to life.

                    snow
          kelvin, you awake?

                    kelvin
          what is it?

                    snow
          can you meet me and sartorius on b
          deck in an hour?

                    kelvin
          why?

                    snow
          just a little strategy session. 
          but in person this time.

                                                  cut to:
