int.  kelvin's room

kelvin and rheya, post-coital.  relaxed.  on the verge of
sleep.

                    rheya
          you sure say "god" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    kelvin
          i know.  i'm putting that in my
          next report.

she smiles.

                    rheya
          right.  the report.  report and
          recommend.

they consider that.

                    rheya
          what does snow think you should do?

                    kelvin
          snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet earth.  this is
          hilarious: he thinks it's god, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

they smile at this.  rheya's smile fades before kelvin's.

                    rheya
          sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    kelvin
          well.  he doesn't think it's god,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          he's thinking: if i can figure out
          how to make it stop, than i am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be god.

                    rheya
          he has a point.

                    kelvin
          he does have a point.  that's just
          not the way i'd like to see it
          proven.

                    rheya
          you feel sorry for solaris, or for
          me?

                    kelvin
          it's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: he is ruthless. 
          unblinking in his prejudice.

                    rheya
          it was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

a beat.  he holds her.

                    rheya
          do i really feel like... i am...?

                    kelvin
          yes.  yes.

                    rheya
          i'm glad.

a beat.

                                                  cut to:
