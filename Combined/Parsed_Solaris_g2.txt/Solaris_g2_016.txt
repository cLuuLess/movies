          interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  all of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  snow and
          sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar i; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  i
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  i will
          attempt to convince snow and
          sartorius to return to earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.
