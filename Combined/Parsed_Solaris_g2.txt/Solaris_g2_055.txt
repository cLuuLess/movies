int.  kelvin's room

on the prometheus.  rheya is awake, kelvin asleep.

she rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  noting her expression:

                    kelvin
          what's wrong.

                    rheya
          you don't love me.

                    kelvin
          stop.

a beat.  she looks down.

                    rheya
          i have to talk to you... i... i
          don't know where i came from.
              (up at him)
          do you know?

he doesn't respond.

                    rheya
          if you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

calmly:

                    kelvin
          what are you talking about?

                    rheya
          that i am not rheya.  that rheya
          died.  killed herself.  i'm
          different.

he's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    kelvin
          who have you been talking to?

                    rheya
              (no reason to lie)
          sartorius.

                    kelvin
          when?  when i'm asleep?

she nods.  he can only imagine what form sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    kelvin
          i'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but i don't know who they
          are.

                    rheya
          i'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

a beat.

                    rheya
          how have you lived the last ten
          years?  did you love anyone?

a long beat.  kelvin shakes his head.

                    rheya
          did you think about me?

another beat.  he nods.  then:

                    rheya
          but we fought.

                    kelvin
          yes.  especially toward the end.

                    rheya
          why did she do it?

                    kelvin
          you... she said i didn't love her.

                    rheya
          was she right?

                    kelvin
          no.  i love you.

                    rheya
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          i love you, too.

if she seems satisfied for the moment, kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    kelvin
          can you sleep?

                    rheya
          i don't think do.  it's not sleep;
          it's something else.  it's all
          around me.

                    kelvin
          those are dreams.

she falls asleep.

                                                fade out.
