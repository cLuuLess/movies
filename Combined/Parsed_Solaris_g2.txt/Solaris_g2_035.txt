int.  kelvin's room

kelvin is getting ready to leave.  rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    kelvin
          all right?

she nods and kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

we sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

in the corridor

kelvin listens.  a long time.

satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a crashing glass from within.  he hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce pounding.

he takes a step back.  an inhuman amount of noise begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  it sounds like a plane is
crashing in kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

rheya

is revealed, covered in blood.  she has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    kelvin
          rheya...

confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    rheya
          what happened?

                    kelvin
          you were trying to break down the
          door.  do you know why?

                    rheya
          when i saw you were gone i got
          scared.

he puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

returning, he blanches.

rheya's wounds have healed; in fact, they are healing in
front of us.

she looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    rheya
          chris, what's wrong with me?

                                                  cut to:
