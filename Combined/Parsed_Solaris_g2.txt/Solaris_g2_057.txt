int.  conference room

kelvin, rheya, sartorius, and snow.  they are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    snow
          gibarian was under enormous --

                    sartorius
          gibarian was helpless.  it's very
          simple: man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    kelvin
          meaning man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    sartorius
          yes.

                    kelvin
          that's fantastic.

                    sartorius
          why did you agree to come here?

a beat.

                    sartorius
          too tired to answer?

looks at rheya, then back to kelvin.

                    sartorius
          i'll bet.  is this what they sent
          you here to do?  you've lost it,
          you've gone native.

kelvin moves toward him.  sartorius just lets him come.

                    rheya
              (to sartorius)
          you're the coward.

                    kelvin
          don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    rheya
              (still, to sartorius)
          i'm just as human as you.  i see, i
          hear, i touch, and i feel just like
          you do.

                    sartorius
          prove it.

                    rheya
          these "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  chris loves
          me.

                    sartorius
          you are not human!  try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    kelvin
          get out of here.

slowly, carefully, sartorius grasps kelvin by the shoulders. 
then he leans in and whispers in kelvin's ear:

                    sartorius
          rheya is dead.  she's a copy.  a
          facsimile.  and she's seducing you
          all over again.  you're sick.  you
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  it's just fucking.

kelvin backs away.

                    sartorius
          there's nothing grandiose about it. 
          you've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

sartorius turns...

                    sartorius
          it'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

and leaves.

a beat.

                    snow
          we didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

snow wanders toward the door.

                    snow
          i'm not feeling well.

he passes kelvin and leaves.

kelvin watches him, then looks at rheya.  she seems dazed.

                                                  cut to:
