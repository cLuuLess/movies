int.  party - night

kelvin and rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  they are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    rheya
          i would have these -- i don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when i was younger.  maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  time would just
          collapse, i would be inside time. 
          i would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  freaky
          stuff.

                    kelvin
          how old were you?

                    rheya
          seven, eight.  so one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what i'm
          doing, and i start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that i can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    kelvin
          what kind of look?
