kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in sartorius'
door.

                    kelvin
          you murdered her!

                    sartorius
          kelvin, she begged me.  i had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  she
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          she was gone.

kelvin looks around.

                    kelvin
          she'll come back.

                    sartorius
          no, she won't.

                    kelvin
          why would you let her to do that?

                    sartorius
          it's not human, kelvin.  whatever
          it is, it's not human, and i am
          threatened by that.  evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          and i want to win.  i want humans
          to win.  so i am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    kelvin
          you fucking bastard...

                    sartorius
          whose side are you on?

kelvin moves away.
