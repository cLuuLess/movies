int.  train - day

continued silence, and:

rheya, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

reverse angle

kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the train.

he is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  the
contrast with his older self is striking.

back to kelvin

asleep on the ship.  after a beat:

extreme close-up:

rheya's lips.

except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

a wider view

reveals that rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in kelvin's room on the prometheus, right now.

she is staring at kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

kelvin

awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

if he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of rheya before.  he looks at her, simply.

rheya

stands and makes her way to kelvin.

without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.
