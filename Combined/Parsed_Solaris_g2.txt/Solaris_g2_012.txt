int.  corridor

kelvin stands outside a door.

                    kelvin
          let me in.

a beat.

                    sartorius
              (inside, muffled)
          you have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  then i'll come out.

                    kelvin
          all right.

sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  he is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    kelvin
          what happened to gibarian?

                    sartorius
          didn't you talk to snow?

                    kelvin
          i want to hear your version.

                    sartorius
              (incredulous)
          who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  at best, you're employee
          of the month for the highest bidder
          in the solaris auction.  they have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          they've never even been in space.
          and i'm supposed to listen to you?

                    kelvin
          i am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  now: what happened
          to him?

                    sartorius
          the same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    kelvin
          where's his body?

                    sartorius
          in the lab.  with her, probably.

                    kelvin
          her?  who are you talking about?

sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  he struggles to keep his composure.

                    sartorius
          his last wish was to be buried on
          earth.  in dirt, he said.  "i want
          to buried in dirt."  what a clown.

sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    kelvin
          they shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    sartorius
          just so you know: i'm not going
          back until i understand what it is. 
          i am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then i will
          go home.

                    kelvin
          listen --

                    sartorius
          we're done.  oh, i should tell you,
          i don't trust snow.  there's
          something wrong with him.

sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  as the door
closes kelvin sees a flash of another figure in sartorius'
room.  the glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  cut to:
