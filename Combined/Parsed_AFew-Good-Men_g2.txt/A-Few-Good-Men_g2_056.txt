               ext. sidewalk stand - night

               kaffee's car

               as it drives along a street in the d.c. business district. 
               it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting 
               against a rain kaffee pulls over at his usual newsstand. he 
               hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and 
               runs to the stand.

                                     kaffee
                         hey, luther.

                                     luther
                         admiral, how's the big case goin'?

                                     kaffee
                         nose to the grindstone.

                                     luther
                         no flies on you.

                                     kaffee
                         a rolling stone gathers no moss.

                                     luther
                         yeah, well it ain't over til the fat 
                         lady sings.

                                     kaffee
                         ain't that the truth. catch you 
                         tomorrow.

               he gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger 
               seat, and turns on the ignition. and as soon as he does

               -- a hand is slapped over his mouth --

                                     voice (o.s.)
                         it's matthew markinson.

               -- and kaffee jumps out of his skin.

               because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is 
               markinson.

                                     kaffee
                         jesus fucking christ!!--

                                     markinson
                         you left the door unlocked.

                                     kaffee
                         scared the shit outta me.

                                     markinson
                         drive.

                                     kaffee
                         are you aware you're under subpoena?

                                     markinson
                         yes. i'm also aware that the lives 
                         of two marines are in your hands. if 
                         there was something i could do about 
                         that, i would, but since i can't, 
                         all i can do is help you. why don't 
                         you drive, lieutenant.

               kaffee begins driving down the street.

                                     kaffee
                         what do you know?

                                     markinson
                         i know everything.

                                     kaffee
                         was it a code red?

                                     markinson
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         did kendrick give the order?

                                     markinson
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         did you witness it?

                                     markinson
                         i didn't need to --

                                     kaffee
                         did you witness it?!

                                     markinson
                         no.

                                     kaffee
                         then how do you know?

                                     markinson
                         i know.

                                     kaffee
                         you know shit.

                                     markinson
                         he was never gonna be transferred 
                         off the base.

               and with this, kaffee screeches the car over to the side of 
               the road. he grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. he 
               turns to markinson.

                                     markinson
                              (continuing)
                         jessep was going to keep him on the 
                         base. he said he wanted him trained.

                                     kaffee
                         we've got the transfer order. it's 
                         got your signature.

                                     markinson
                         i know. i signed it the morning you 
                         arrived in cuba. six days after 
                         santiago died.

               kaffee's wheels are spinning. he's pumped.

                                     kaffee
                         i'm gonna get you a deal. some kind 
                         of immunity with the prosecutor. in 
                         about four days, you're gonna appear 
                         as a witness for the defense, and 
                         you're gonna tell the court exactly 
                         what you told me. right now i'm gonna 
                         check you into a motel, and we're 
                         gonna start from the beginning.

                                     markinson
                         i don't want a deal. and i don't 
                         want immunity.

               kaffee shakes his head and laughs.

                                     markinson
                              (continuing)
                         i want you to know, i'm proud neither 
                         of what i've done nor what i'm doing.

               kaffee puts the car in gear and we

                                                                    cut to:
