               int. west's office - day

               as jo  enters. captain west and two other officers, gibbs 
               and lawrence, sit around a conference table.

                                     gibbs
                         jo, come on in.

                                     jo
                         thank you, sir.

                                     gibbs
                         captain west, this is lt. commander 
                         galloway. jo, you know mike lawrence.

                                     jo
                         yes sir.
                              (to west)
                         captain, i appreciate your seeing me 
                         on such short notice.

                                     west
                         i understand there was some trouble 
                         over the weekend down in cuba.

                                     jo
                         yes sir... this past friday evening.  
                         two marines, corporal harold dawson 
                         and private louden downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a pfc william 
                         santiago and assaulted him. santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. the nis 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. they're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in 
                         cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                                     lawrence
                         what's the problem?

                                     jo
                         dawson and downey are both recruiting 
                         poster marines and santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. i was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a 
                         code red.

               jo lets this sink in a moment.

                                     west
                              (under his breath)
                         christ.

                                     jo
                         i'd like them moved up to washington 
                         and assigned counsel. someone who 
                         can really look into this. someone 
                         who possesses not only the legal 
                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. in 
                         short, captain, i'd like to suggest 
                         that... i be the one who, that it be 
                         me who is assigned to represent them.
                              (beat)
                         myself.

               jo looks around the room for a response.

                                     west
                         joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
                         cup of coffee.

                                     jo
                         thank you, sir, i'm fine.

                                     west
                         joanne, i'd like you to leave the 
                         room so we can talk about you behind 
                         your back.

                                     jo
                         certainly, sir.

               jo gets up and walks out.

                                     west
                         i thought this code red shit wasn't 
                         going on anymore.

                                     lawrence
                         with the marines at gitmo? who the 
                         hell knows what goes on down there.

                                     west
                         well lets find out before the rest 
                         of the world does, this thing could 
                         get messy. what about this woman?

                                     lawrence
                         jo's been working a desk at internal 
                         affairs for what, almost a year now.

                                     west
                         and before that?

                                     gibbs
                         she disposed of three cases in two 
                         years.

                                     west
                         three cases in two years? who was 
                         she handling, the rosenbergs?

                                     gibbs
                         she's not cut out for litigation.

                                     lawrence
                         she's a hall of an investigator, 
                         jerry --

                                     gibbs
                         in internal affairs, sure. she can 
                         crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
                         best of 'em, but when it comes to 
                         trial work --

                                     west
                         i know. all passion, no street smarts. 
                         bring her back in.

               lawrence goes to the door and motions for jo to come back 
               in.

                                     west
                              (continuing)
                         commander, we're gonna move the 
                         defendants up here in the morning.

                                     jo
                         thank you, sir.

                                     west
                         and i'll have division assign them 
                         counsel...

                                     jo
                              (beat)
                         but... not me.

                                     west
                         from what i understand from your 
                         colleagues, you're much too valuable 
                         in your present assignment to be 
                         wasted on what i'm sure will boil 
                         down to a five minute plea bargain 
                         and a week's worth of paper work.

                                     jo
                         sir --

                                     west
                         don't worry about it. i promise you, 
                         division'll assign the right man for 
                         the job.

                                                                    cut to:
