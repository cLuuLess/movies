               on the virginia side of the potomac. kaffee and jo are sitting 
               at a table, finishing up dinner.

                                     jo
                         my third case was a drunk and 
                         disorderly. the trial lasted nine 
                         weeks. i rounded up 31 people who 
                         were in the bar that night.

                                     kaffee
                         nine weeks on a d and d? what was 
                         the prosecutor offering?

                              (pause)
                         well, you sure hustled the shit outta 
                         him.

                                     jo
                         after that, they moved me to internal 
                         affairs.

                                     kaffee
                         tough to blame them.

                                     jo
                         where i've earned two distinguished 
                         service medals and two letters of 
                         commendation.

                                     kaffee
                         why are you always giving me your 
                         resume?

                                     jo
                         because i want you to think i'm good 
                         lawyer.

                                     kaffee
                         i do.

                                     jo
                         no you don't.
                              (beat)
                         i think you're an exceptional lawyer. 
                         i watch the jurors, they respond to 
                         you, they like you. i see you 
                         convincing them. i think dawson and 
                         downey are gonna end up owing their 
                         lives to you.

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         jo... i think you have to prepare 
                         yourself for the fact that we're 
                         gonna lose.
                              (beat)
                         ross's opening speech, it was all 
                         true.
                              (beat)
                         i mean, let's pretend for a minute 
                         that it would actually matter to 
                         this jury that the guys were given 
                         an order. we can't prove it ever 
                         happened.
                              (beat)
                         we'll keep doing what we're doing, 
                         and we'll put on a show, but at the 
                         end of the day, all we have is the 
                         testimony of two people accused of 
                         murder.

                                     jo
                         we'll find markinson.

                                     kaffee
                         jo, we're gonna lose. and we're gonna 
                         lose huge.

               we hold on then for a moment, and in voice over hear

                         barracks windward, guantanamo bay, 
                         cuba.

                                                                    cut to:

               corporal howard, the young marine who drove the lawyers around 
               cuba, is on the stand.

                                     kaffee
                         corporal howard, name some reasons 
                         why a marine would get a code red?

                                     howard
                         being late for platoon or company 
                         meetings, keeping his barracks in 
                         disorder, falling back on a run...

                                     kaffee
                         have you ever received a code red?

                                     howard
                         yes sir. we were doing seven man 
                         assault drills, and my weapon slipped. 
                         it's just cause it was over a hundred 
                         degrees and my palms were sweaty and 
                         i'd forgot to use the resin like we 
                         were taught.

                                     kaffee
                         and what happened?

                                     howard
                         that night the guys in my squad threw 
                         a blanket over me and took turns 
                         punching me in the arm for five 
                         minutes. then they poured glue on my 
                         hands. and it worked, too, 'cause i 
                         ain't never dropped my weapon since.

                                     kaffee
                         was private santiago ever late for 
                         platoon meetings?

                                     howard
                         yes sir.

                                     kaffee
                         was his barracks ever in disorder?

                                     howard
                         yes sir.

                                     kaffee
                         did he ever fall back on a run?

                                     howard
                         all the time, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         did he ever, prior to the night of 
                         august 6th, receive a code red?

                                     howard
                         no sir.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         never?

                                     howard
                         no, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         you got a code red 'cause your palms 
                         were sweaty. why didn't santiago, 
                         this burden to his unit, ever get 
                         one?

                                     howard
                         dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

                         dawson wouldn't allow it.

                                     howard
                         the guys talked tough about santiago, 
                         but they wouldn't go near him. they 
                         were too afraid of dawson, sir.

                                     ross
                         object. the witness is characterizing.

                                     kaffee
                         i'll rephrase. jeffrey, did you ever 
                         want to give santiago a code red?

                                     howard
                         yes sir.

                                     kaffee
                         why didn't you?

                                     howard
                         'cause dawson'd kick my butt, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         good enough. lt. ross is gonna ask 
                         you some questions now.

               ross takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on 
               the table. he brings one to howard.

                                     ross
                         corporal howard, i hold here the 
                         marine guide and general information 
                         handbook for new recruits. are you 
                         familiar with this book?

                                     howard
                         yes sir.

                                     ross
                         have you read it?

                                     howard
                         yes sir.

                                     ross
                         good.
                              (hands him the book)
                         would you turn to the chapter that 
                         deals with code reds, please.

                                     howard
                         sir?

                                     ross
                         just flip to the page in that book 
                         that discusses code reds.

                                     howard
                         sir, you see, code red is a term we 
                         use -- it's just used down at gitmo, 
                         sir. i don't know if it actually --

               ross has produced another book.

                                     ross
                         we're in luck, then. the marine corps 
                         guide for sentry duty, navy base 
                         guantanamo bay, cuba. i assume we'll 
                         find the term code red and its 
                         definition in this book, am i correct?

                                     howard
                         no sir.

                                     ross
                         no? corporal howard, i'm a marine. 
                         is their no book, no manual or 
                         pamphlet, no set of orders or 
                         regulations that let me know that, 
                         as a marine, one of my duties is to 
                         perform code reds?

                                     howard
                              (pause)
                         no sir. no books, sir.

                                     ross
                         no further questions.

               ross sits. kaffee walks over to ross's table and picks up 
               one of the books. he brings it to howard.

                                     kaffee
                         corporal, would you turn to the page 
                         in this book that says where the 
                         enlisted men's mess hall is?

                                     howard
                         lt. kaffee, that's not in the book, 
                         sir.

                                     kaffee
                         i don't understand, how did you know 
                         where the enlisted men's mess hall 
                         was if it's not in this book?

                                     howard
                         i guess i just followed the crowd at 
                         chow time, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         no more questions.

               kaffee chucks the book back on ross's desk.

                                     randolph
                         corporal howard, you can step down.

                                     howard
                              (greatly relieved)
                         thank you, sir.

               kaffee gives howard a subtle "you did good, kid" look, and 
               we

                                                                    cut to:
