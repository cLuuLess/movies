               ext. a sentry tower --

               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. we hear all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. we also hear, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. and as this starts, 
               we begin to move slowly up the tower, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... the lookout 
               post, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               standing the post is the silhouette of a marine. he's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               the drum cadence has been building slightly.

                                                                    cut to:

               a wider shot of the fenceline. and we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

               the drum cadence continues, and we
