               int. santiago's room - day

               the room is exactly an it was left that night. the un-made 
               bed, the chair knocked over... the lawyers look around for a 
               moment. the room is sparse.

               kaffee goes to the closet and opens it: a row of uniforms 
               hanging neatly. he thumbs through then for a second, but 
               there's nothing there.

               he opens the footlocker: socks, underwear... all folded to 
               marine corp precision... a shaving kit, a couple of 
               photographs, a pad of writing paper and some envelopes...

               kaffee closes the footlocker.

                                     kaffee
                         sam, somebody should see about getting 
                         this stuff to his parents. we don't 
                         need it anymore.

                                     kendrick
                         actually, the uniforms belong to the 
                         marine corps.

               the lawyers take a moment.

                                     kaffee
                         lt. kendrick -- can i call you jon?

                                     kendrick
                         no, you may not.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         have i done something to offend you?

                                     kendrick
                         no, i like all you navy boys. every 
                         time we've gotta go someplace and 
                         fight, you fellas always give us a 
                         ride.

                                     jo
                         lt. kendrick, do you think santiago 
                         was murdered?

                                     kendrick
                         commander, i believe in god, and in 
                         his son jesus christ, and because i 
                         do, i can say this: private santiago 
                         is dead and that's a tragedy. but 
                         he's dead because he had no code. 
                         he's dead because he had no honor. 
                         and god was watching.

               sam turns to kaffee.

                                     sam
                         how do you feel about that theory?

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         sounds good. let's move on.

               sam and kendrick walk out the door. jo stops kaffee.

                                     jo
                         you planning on doing any 
                         investigating or are you just gonna 
                         take the guided tour?

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         i'm pacing myself.

                                                                    cut to:
