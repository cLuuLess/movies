               int. the apartment - night

               mos -- the clock reads 3:37, and kaffee, in sweatpants and a 
               bathrobe, is pacing around slowly with his baseball bat and

                                                                    cut to:

               sam and jo art listening to a lecture for the 14th time.

                                     kaffee
                         poker faces. don't flinch in front 
                         of the jury. something doesn't go 
                         our way, don't hang your head, don't 
                         shift in your seat, don't scribble 
                         furiously. whatever happens, you 
                         have to look like it's exactly what 
                         you knew was gonna happen. when you 
                         pass me documents --

                                     jo/sam
                         do it swiftly, but don't look 
                         overanxious.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         and don't wear that perfume in court, 
                         it wrecks my concentration.

                                     jo
                         really!

                                     kaffee
                         i was talking to sam.

                                     sam
                         what time is it?

                                     kaffee
                         time to go home. try to get some 
                         sleep tonight.

                                     jo
                              (to sam)
                         i'll give you a ride.

               sam begins to gather up his things. he stands in front of 
               kaffee.

                                     kaffee
                              (to sam)
                         you're a good man, charlie brown.

                                     sam
                         see you in court.

               sam steps out the door. jo looks at the ground, then up at 
               kaffee.

                                     jo
                         danny --

                                     kaffee
                         i know what you're gonna say. you 
                         don't have to. we've had our 
                         differences. i've said some things i 
                         didn't mean, you've said some things 
                         you didn't means but you're happy 
                         that i stuck with the case. and if 
                         you've gained a certain respect for 
                         me over the last three weeks that 
                         you didn't have before, well, of 
                         course i'm happy about that, but we 
                         don't have to make a whole big deal 
                         out of it. you like me. i won't make 
                         you say it.

                                     jo
                         i was just gonna tell you to wear 
                         matching socks tomorrow.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         oh.
                              (beat)
                         okay. good tip.

                                     jo
                         we're ready.

                                     kaffee
                         bet your ass.

               jo walks out the door and kaffee closes it and locks it behind 
               her.

               then he says, very softly...

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         we're gonna get creamed.

                                                                    cut to:
