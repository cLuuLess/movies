               int. kaffee's apartment - later - afternoon

               a nerf ball bounces off the wall.

               kaffee, jo and sam are sprawled out in the living room. for 
               hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea.  
               kaffee's mind seems to be on his basketball game.

                                     jo
                         i say we hit him with the phoney 
                         transfer order.

                                     sam
                         what's the transfer order without a 
                         witness?

                                     kaffee
                         we have a witness.

                                     sam
                         a dead witness.

                                     kaffee
                         and in the hands of a lesser attorney, 
                         that'd be a problem.

                                     sam
                         look at this. last night he was 
                         swimming in his jack daniels, now he 
                         can leap tall buildings in a single 
                         bound.

                                     kaffee
                         i'm getting my second wind. siddown. 
                         both of you.

               he sees that sam and jo were already sitting down.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         good.
                              (beat)
                         jessep told kendrick to order a code 
                         red. kendrick did, and our clients 
                         followed the order. the cover-up 
                         isn't our case. to win, jessep has 
                         to tell the jury that he ordered the 
                         code red.

                                     sam
                         and you think you can got him to 
                         just say it?

                                     kaffee
                         i think he wants to say it. i think 
                         he's pissed off that he's gotta hide 
                         from us. i think he wants to say 
                         that he made a command decision and 
                         that's the end of it. he eats 
                         breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 
                         cubans who are trained to kill him, 
                         and no one's gonna tell him how to 
                         run his base. least of all the pushy 
                         broad, the smart jew, and the harvard 
                         clown. i need to shake him and put 
                         him on the defensive.

               sam and jo are silent for a moment.

                                     sam
                         that's it? that's the plan?

                                     kaffee
                         that's the plan.

                                     sam
                         you're gonna trip jessep and he's 
                         gonna confess.

                                     kaffee
                         i'm not gonna trip him. i'm gonna 
                         lead him right where he's dying to 
                         go.

                                     sam
                         and how are you gonna do that?

                                     kaffee
                         i have no idea. i need my bat.

                                     jo
                         what?

                                     kaffee
                              (looking around)
                         i need my bat. i think better with 
                         my bat. where's my bat?

                                     jo
                         i put it in the closet.

                                     kaffee
                         you put it in the closet.

               kaffee heads to the closet.

                                     jo
                         i was tripping over it.

                                     kaffee (o.s.)
                         don't ever put a bat in a closet.

                                     jo
                         he thinks better with his bat?

               and we go to kaffee at the closet.

               offscreen we hear

                                     sam (o.s.)
                         i can understand that. i used to 
                         have stuffed panda named mr. boob. i 
                         could never do my home work without 
                         him.

               during this, kaffee's opened the closet door. he reaches in 
               to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something:

               his clothes.

               his uniforms and his civilian clothes. hanging neatly along 
               the bar. he stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads 
               back through the living room towards the front door.

                                     kaffee
                         stay here, i'm going to the office 
                         for a while.

               kaffee storms out.

                                     sam
                         boy, he does think better with that 
                         bat.

                                                                    cut to:
