               int. kaffee's apartment - night

               jo and sam are sitting in silence. it's dark outside.

                                     jo
                         where do you think he is?

               sam doesn't know. jo is beside herself, and trying to keep 
               it together.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         as far as downey was concerned, it 
                         was an order from kendrick. it didn't 
                         matter that he didn't hear it first 
                         hand. he doesn't distinguish between 
                         the two.

               sam understands, but he doesn't say anything. the door opens 
               and kaffee walks in.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         danny. i'm sorry.

               kaffee seems to be in an incredibly normal mood.

                                     kaffee
                         don't worry about it.

                                     jo
                         sam and i were just talking about 
                         how all we really have to do is call 
                         some witnesses who'll talk about 
                         implied orders... or maybe we put 
                         downey back on the stand before we 
                         get to dawson.

                                     kaffee
                         maybe if we work at it we can get 
                         dawson charged with the kennedy 
                         assassination.

               jo studies kaffee for a moment.

                                     jo
                         are you drunk?

                                     kaffee
                              (a simple answer)
                         pretty much. yeah.

                                     jo
                              (pause)
                         i'll make a pot of coffee. we have a 
                         long night's work ahead.

                                     kaffee
                         she's gonna make coffee. that's nice.
                              (beat)
                         he wasn't in his room.
                              (kaffee's amazed)
                         he wasn't even there.
                              (beat)
                         that was an important piece of 
                         information, don't you think?

                                     jo
                              (pause)
                         danny, it was just a setback. i'm 
                         sorry. but we'll fix it and then 
                         move on to markinson.

                                     kaffee
                         markinson's dead.

               jo and sam are frozen.

               kaffee says this with no particular feeling one way or the 
               other.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         you really gotta hand it to those 
                         federal marshals, boy.
                              (he almost has to 
                              laugh)
                         it's not like he hanged himself by 
                         his shoelaces or slashed his wrists 
                         with a concealed butter knife. this 
                         guy got, into full dress uniform, 
                         stood in the middle of that room, 
                         drew a nickle plated pistol from his 
                         holster, and fired a bullet into his 
                         mouth.

               jo and sam don't say anything.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         anyway, since we seem to be out of 
                         witnesses, i thought i'd drink a 
                         little.

                                     jo
                         i still think we can win.

                                     kaffee
                         then maybe you should drink a little.

                                     jo
                         look, we'll go to randolph in the 
                         morning and make a motion for a 
                         continuance. 24 hours.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         why would we want to do that?

                                     jo
                         to subpoena colonel jessep.

                                     kaffee
                         what?

                                     jo
                         listen for a second --

                                     kaffee
                         no.

                                     jo
                         just hear me out --

                                     kaffee
                         no. i won't listen to you and i won't 
                         hear you out. your passion is 
                         comforting, jo. it's also useless. 
                         private downey needed a trial lawyer 
                         today.

                                     jo
                              (pause)
                         you chicken-shit. you're gonna use 
                         what happened today as an excuse to 
                         give up.

                                     kaffee
                         it's over!

                                     jo
                         why did you ask jessep for the 
                         transfer order?

                                     kaffee
                         what are you --

                                     jo
                         in cuba. why did you ask jessep for 
                         the transfer order?

                                     kaffee
                         what does it matter --

                                     jo
                         why?!

                                     kaffee
                         i wanted the damn transfer order!

                                     jo
                         bullshit! you could've gotten it by 
                         picking up the phone and calling any 
                         one of a dozen departments at the 
                         pentagon. you didn't want the transfer 
                         order. you wanted to see jessep's 
                         reaction when you asked for the 
                         transfer order. you had an instinct. 
                         and it was confirmed by markinson. 
                         now damnit, let's put jessep on the 
                         stand and end this thing!

                                     kaffee
                         what possible good could come from 
                         putting jessep on the stand?

                                     jo
                         he told kendrick to order the code 
                         red.

                                     kaffee
                         he did?! why didn't you say so!? 
                         that's qreat! and of course you have 
                         proof of that.

                                     jo
                         i --

                                     kaffee
                         ah, i keep forgetting: you were sick 
                         the day they taught law at law school.

                                     jo
                         you put him on the stand and you get 
                         it from him!

                                     kaffee
                         yes. no problem. we get it from him.
                              (to sam)
                         colonel, isn't it true that you 
                         ordered the code red on santiago?

                                     sam
                         look, we're all a little --

                                     kaffee
                         i'm sorry, your time's run out. what 
                         do we have for the losers, judge? 
                         well, for our defendants it's a 
                         lifetime at exotic fort levenworth. 
                         and for defense counsel kaffee? that's 
                         right -- it's -- a court -- martial. 
                         yes, johnny, after falsely accusing 
                         a marine officer of conspiracy, lt.  
                         kaffee will have a long and prosperous 
                         career teaching typewriter maintenance 
                         at the rocco columbo school for women.  
                         thank you for playing "should we or 
                         should-we-not follow the advice of 
                         the galacticly stupid".

               and with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk. a 
               ton of papers, books, files, etc., falls to the floor.

               there's dead silence. maybe just the sound of kaffee breathing 
               after this exhausting outburst.

               finally...

                                     jo
                         i'm sorry i lost you your set of 
                         steak knives.

               jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. the door slams 
               behind her.

               kaffee walks into the kitchen without a word.

               sam gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the 
               stuff that kaffee knocked off the desk.

               kaffee comes back in with a bottle of jack daniels.

                                     kaffee
                         stop cleaning up.

               but sam continues.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         sam. stop cleaning up.

               sam stops and sits in a chair. kaffee sits on the couch.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         you want a drink?

                                     sam
                         yeah.

               sam takes a swig from the bottle.

                                     kaffee
                         is your father proud of you?

                                     sam
                         don't do this to yourself.

                                     kaffee
                         i'll bet he is. i'll bet he bores 
                         the shit outta the neighbors and the 
                         relatives. "sam, made law review.  
                         he's got a big case he's making -- 
                         he's arguing making an argument."
                              (pause)
                         i think my father would've enjoyed 
                         seeing me graduate from law school.
                              (beat)
                         i think he would've liked that... an 
                         awful lot.

                                     sam
                         did i ever tell you that i wrote a 
                         paper on your father in college?

                                     kaffee
                         yeah?

                                     sam
                         he was one of the best trial lawyers 
                         ever.

                                     kaffee
                         yes he was.

                                     sam
                         and if i were dawson and downey and 
                         i had a choice between you or your 
                         father to represent me in this case, 
                         i'd take you any day of the week and 
                         twice on sunday. you should have 
                         seen yourself thunder away at 
                         kendrick.

                                     kaffee
                         would you put jessep on the stand?

                                     sam
                         no.

                                     kaffee
                         you think my father would've?

                                     sam
                         with the evidence we've got? not in 
                         a million years. but here's the thing --
                         and there's really no way of getting 
                         around this -- neither lionel kaffee 
                         nor sam weinberg are lead counsel 
                         for the defense in the matter of 
                         u.s. versus dawson and downey. so 
                         there's only one question. what would 
                         you do?

               we hold on the two of them for a moment, then

                                                                    cut to:
