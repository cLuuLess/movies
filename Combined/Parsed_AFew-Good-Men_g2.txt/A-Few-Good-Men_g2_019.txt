                         sir, lance corporal harold w. dawson, 
                         sir. rifle security company windward,

                                     kaffee
                         someone hasn't been working and 
                         playing well with others, harold.

                                     dawson
                         sir, yes sir!

                                     downey

                                     kaffee

                         weinerg, you can sitdown.

               dawson and downey aren't too comfortable sitting in the 
               presence of officers, but they do as they're told. kaffee's 
               pulled out some documents, sam's sitting on one of the cots 
               taking notes.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing; to dawson)
                         is this your signature?

                                     dawson
                         yes sir.

                                     kaffee
                         you don't have to call me sir.
                              (to downey)
                         is this your signature?

                                     downey
                         sir, yes sir.

                                     kaffee
                         and you certainly don't have to do 
                         it twice in one sentence. harold, 
                         what's a code red?

                                     dawson
                         sir, a code red is a disciplinary 
                         engagement.

                                     kaffee
                         what does that mean, exactly?

                                     dawson
                         sir, a marine falls out of line, 
                         it's up to the men in his unit to 
                         get him back on track.

                                     kaffee
                         what's a garden variety code red?

                                     dawson
                         sir?

                                     kaffee
                         harold, you say sir and i turn around 
                         and look for my father. danny, daniel, 
                         kaffee. garden variety; typical. 
                         what's a basic code red?

                                     dawson
                         sir, a marine has refused to bathe 
                         on a regular basis. the men in his 
                         squad would give him a g.i. shower.

                                     kaffee
                         what's that?

                                     dawson
                         scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel 
                         wool...

                                     sam
                         beautiful.

                                     kaffee
                         was the attack on santiago a code 
                         red?

                                     dawson
                         yes sir.

                                     kaffee
                              (to downey)
                         do you ever talk?

                                     dawson
                         sir, private downey will answer any 
                         direct questions you ask him.

                                     kaffee
                         swell. private downey, the rag you 
                         stuffed in santiago's mouth, was 
                         there poison on it?

                                     downey
                         no sir.

                                     kaffee
                         silver polish, turpentine, anti-
                         freeze...

                                     downey
                         no sir. we were gonna shave his head, 
                         sir.

                                     kaffee
                         when all of a sudden...?

                                     downey
                         we saw blood drippinq out of his 
                         mouth. then we pulled the tape off, 
                         and there was blood all down his 
                         face, sir. that's when corporal dawson 
                         called the ambulance.

               kaffee tries not to make too big a deal out of this last 
               piece of news.

                                     kaffee
                              (to dawson)
                         did anyone see you call the ambulance?

                                     dawson
                         no sir.

                                     kaffee
                         were you there when the ambulance 
                         got there?

                                     dawson
                         yes sir, that's when we were taken 
                         under arrest.

               kaffee kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for 
               a moment.

                                     sam
                              (to dawson)
                         on the night of august 2nd, did you 
                         fire a shot across the fenceline 
                         into cuba?

                                     dawson
                         yes sir.

                                     sam
                         why?

                                     dawson
                         my mirror engaged, sir.

                                     kaffee
                              (to sam)
                         his mirror engaged?

                                     sam
                         for each american sentry post there's 
                         a cuban counterpart. they're called 
                         mirrors. the corporal's claiming 
                         that his mirror was about to fire at 
                         him.

                                     kaffee
                         santiago's letter to the nis said 
                         you fired illegally. he's saying 
                         that the guy, the mirror, he never 
                         made a move.

               dawson says nothing.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         oh, harold?

               sam is staring at dawson.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         you see what i'm getting at? if 
                         santiago didn't have anything on 
                         you, then why did you give him a 
                         code red?

                                     dawson
                         because he broke the chain of command, 
                         sir.

                                     kaffee
                         he what?

                                     dawson
                         he went outside his unit, sir. if he 
                         had a problem, he should've spoken 
                         to me, sir. then his sergeant, then 
                         company commander, then --

                                     kaffee
                         yeah, yeah, alright. harold, did you 
                         assault santiago with the intent of 
                         killing him?

                                     dawson
                         no sir.

                                     kaffee
                         what was your intent?

                                     dawson
                         to train him, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         train him to do what?

                                     dawson
                         train him to think of his unit before 
                         himself. to respect the code.

                                     sam
                         what's the code?

                                     dawson
                         unit corps god country.

                                     sam
                         i beg your pardon?

                                     dawson
                         unit corps god country, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         the goverrment of the united states 
                         wants to charge you two with murder. 
                         you want me to go to the prosecutor 
                         with unit, corps, god, country?

               dawson stares at kaffee.

                                     dawson
                         that's our code, sir.

               kaffee takes a long moment. he picks up his briefcase and he 
               and sam move to the door.

                                     kaffee
                         we'll be back. you guys need anything? 
                         books paper, cigarettes, a ham 
                         sandwich?

                                     dawson
                         sir. no thank you. sir.

               kaffee smiles at dawson.

                                     kaffee
                         harold, i think there's a concept 
                         you better start warming up to.

                                     dawson
                         sir?

                                     kaffee
                         i'm the only friend you've got.

               and as kaffee and sam walk out the open cell door, dawson 
               and downey come to attention and snap a salute.

               they hold the salute until kaffee and sam are well out of 
               sight, and we

                                                                    cut to:
