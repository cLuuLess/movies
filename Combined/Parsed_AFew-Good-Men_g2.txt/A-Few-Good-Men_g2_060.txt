               int. the courtroom - day

               kendrick's on the stand. what drives kaffee's entire 
               examination of kendrick is this: kaffee's got him. he's gonna 
               win. at least this round. all he has to do is not let his 
               emotions take control of his professional skill.

               sam will have files and documents ready to hand kaffee as he 
               needs them.

                                     kaffee
                         lt. kendrick, in your opinion, was 
                         private santiago a good marine?

                                     kendrick
                         i'd say he was about average.

                                     kaffee
                         lieutenant, you signed three fitness 
                         reports on santiago. on all three 
                         reports you indicated a rating of 
                         below average.

                                     kendrick
                         yes. private santiago was below 
                         average i didn't see the need in 
                         trampling on a man's grave.

                                     kaffee
                         we appreciate that, but you're under 
                         oath now, and i think unpleasant as 
                         it may be, we'd all just as soon 
                         hear the truth.

                                     kendrick
                         i'm aware of my oath.

               kaffee's handed some more files.

                         lieutenant, these are the last three 
                         fitness reports you signed for lance 
                         corporal dawson and pfc downey. downey 
                         received three straight marks of 
                         exceptional. dawson received two 
                         marks of exceptional, but on this 
                         most recent report, dated june 9th 
                         of this year, he received a rating 
                         of below average. it's this last 
                         report that i'd like to discuss for 
                         a moment.

                                     kendrick
                         that's fine.

                                     kaffee
                         lance corporal dawson's ranking after 
                         infantry training school was perfect. 
                         records indicate that over half that 
                         class has since been promoted to 
                         full corporal, while dawson has 
                         remained a lance corporal. was 
                         dawson's promotion held up because 
                         of this last fitness report.

                                     kendrick

                                     kaffee
                         do you recall why dawson was given 
                         such a poor grade on this report?

                                     kendrick
                         i'm sure i don't. i have many men in 
                         my charge, lieutenant, i write many 
                         fitness reports.

                         do you recall an incident involving 
                         a pfc curtis barnes who'd been found 
                         stealing liquor from the officer's 
                         club?

                                     kendrick
                         i have two books at my bedside, 
                         lieutenant, the marine code of conduct 
                         and the king james bible. the only 
                         proper authorities i'm aware of are 
                         my commanding officer, colonel nathan

                         have the record reflect your lack of

                         did you report private barnes to

                                     kendrick
                         i remember thinking very highly of 
                         private barnes, and not wanting to 
                         see his record tarnished by a formal 
                         charge.

                         you preferred it to be handled within 
                         the unit.

                                     kendrick
                         i most certainly did.

                         lieutenant, do you know what a code 
                         red is?

                                     kendrick
                         yes i do.

                                     kaffee
                         have you ever ordered a code red?

                                     kendrick
                         no, i have not.

                                     kaffee
                         lieutenant, did you order dawson and 
                         two other men to make sure that 
                         private barnes receive no food or 
                         drink except water for a period of 
                         seven days?

                                     kendrick
                         that's a distortion of the truth. 
                         private barnes was placed on barracks 
                         restriction. he was given water and 
                         vitamin supplements, and i assure 
                         you that at no time was his health 
                         in danger.

                         i'm sure it was lovely for private 
                         barnes, but you did order the barracks 
                         restriction, didn't you? and you did 
                         order the denial of food.

                                     kendrick
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         wouldn't this form of discipline be 
                         considered a code red?

                         other men would say. we object to 
                         this entire line of questioning as

                         of below average on this last fitness 
                         report because you learned held been

                         corporal dawson was found to be below 
                         average because he committed a crime.

                         lieutenant kendrick?
                              (beat)
                         dawson brought a hungry guy some 
                         food. what crime did he commit?

                                     kendrick
                         he disobeyed an order.

                                     kaffee
                         and because he did, because he 
                         exercised his own set of values, 
                         because he made a decision about the 
                         welfare of a marine that was in 
                         conflict with an order of yours, he 
                         was punished, is that right?

                                     kendrick
                         corporal dawson disobeyed an order.

                                     kaffee
                         yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? 
                         after all, it's peacetime. he wasn't 
                         being asked to secure a hill... or 
                         advance on a beachhead. i mean, surely 
                         a marine of dawson's intelligence 
                         can be trusted to determine on his 
                         own, which are the really important 
                         orders, and which orders might, say,

                         can he? can corporal dawson determine
