               there's some understandable tension in the room, broken by --

                                     jo
                         alright. let's sort this out. there 
                         was a platoon meeting on august 6th 
                         at four in the afternoon. and lt. 
                         kendrick, he gave strict instructions 
                         that nothing was to happen to 
                         santiago. now is that true? i want 
                         you to speak freely.

                                     dawson
                         ma'am, that's correct. but then he 
                         dismissed the platoon and we all 
                         went to our rooms.

                                     jo
                         and what happened then?

                                     dawson
                         lt. kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

                                     kaffee
                         when?

                                     dawson
                         about five minutes after the meeting 
                         broke, sir. about 16:20.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         and what happened then?

                                     dawson
                         lt. kendrick ordered us to give 
                         santiago a code red.

                                                                    cut to:
