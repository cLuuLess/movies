               int. the officers club - day

               jessep, markinson, kendrick and the lawyers are seated at a 
               table in the corner.

               stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. jessep is 
               finishing a story.

                                     jessep
                         ...and they spent the next three 
                         hours running around, looking for 
                         americans to surrender to.

               jessep laughs. kendrick joins him. sam and kaffee force a 
               laugh.

               markinson forces a smile. jo remains silent.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing; to the 
                              stewards)
                         that was delicious, men, thank you.

                                     steward
                         our pleasure, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         colonel just need to ask you a couple 
                         of questions about august 6th.

                                     jessep
                         shoot.

                                     kaffee
                         on the morning of the sixth, you 
                         were contacted by an nis angent who 
                         said that santiago had tipped him 
                         off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         santiago was gonna reveal the person's 
                         name in exchange for a transfer. an 
                         i getting this right?

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         if you feel there are any details 
                         that i'm missing, you should free to 
                         speak up.

               jessep's not quite sure what to say to this navy lawyer 
               lieutenant-smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak 
               freely on his own base.

                                     jessep
                         thank you.

                                     kaffee
                         now it was at this point that you 
                         called captain markinson and lt. 
                         kendrick into your office?

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         and what happened then?

                                     jessep
                         we agreed that for his own safety, 
                         santiago should be transferred off 
                         the base.

               here's something else kaffee didn't know. neither did jo. 
               sam jots something down on a small notepad.

               markinson doesn't flinch.

                                     kaffee
                         santiago was set to be transferred?

                                     jessep
                         on the first available flight to the 
                         states. six the next morning. three 
                         hours too late as it turned out.

               kaffee nods.

                                     kaffee
                         yeah.

               there's silence for a moment.

               kaffee takes a sip of his coffee. then drains the cup and 
               puts it down.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         alright, that's all i have. thanks 
                         very much for your time.

                                     kendrick
                         the corporal's got the jeep outside, 
                         he'll take you back to the airstrip.

                                     kaffee
                              (standing)
                         thank you.

                                     jo
                         wait a minute, i've got some 
                         questions.

                                     kaffee
                         no you don't.

                                     jo
                         yes i do.

                                     kaffee
                         no you don't.

                                     jo
                         colonel, on the morning that santiago 
                         died, did you meet with doctor stone 
                         between three and five?

                                     kaffee
                         jo --

                                     jessep
                         of course i met with the doctor. one 
                         of my men was dead.

                                     kaffee
                              (to jo)
                         see? the man was dead. let's go.

                                     jo
                              (to jessep)
                         i was wondering if you've ever heard 
                         the term code red.

                                     kaffee
                         jo --

                                     jessep
                         i've heard the term, yes.

                                     jo
                         colonel, this past february, you 
                         received a cautionary memo from the 
                         naval investigative service, warning 
                         that the practice of enlisted men 
                         disciplining their own wasn't to be 
                         condoned by officers.

                                     jessep
                         i submit to you that whoever wrote 
                         that memo has never served on the 
                         working end of a soviet-made cuban 
                         ml-al6 assault rifle. however, the 
                         directive having come from the nis, 
                         i gave it its due attention. what's 
                         your point, jo?

                                     kaffee
                         she has no point. she often has no 
                         point. it's part of her charm. we're 
                         outta here. thank you.

                                     jo
                         my point is that i think code reds 
                         still go on down here. do code reds 
                         still happen on this base, colonel?

                                     kaffee
                         jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer 
                         that.

                                     jo
                         yes he does.

                                     kaffee
                         no, he really doesn't.

                                     jo
                         yeah, he really does. colonel?

                                     jessep
                         you know it just hit me. she outranks 
                         you, danny.

                                     kaffee
                         yes sir.

                                     jessep
                         i want to tell you something danny 
                         and listen up 'cause i mean this: 
                         you're the luckiest man in the world. 
                         there is, believe me gentlemen, 
                         nothing sexier on earth than a woman 
                         you have to salute in the morning. 
                         promote 'em all i say.

               jo's not upset. jo's not mad. but she's gonna ask her question 
               'til she gets an answer.

                                     jo
                         colonel, the practice of code reds 
                         is still condoned by officers on 
                         this base, isn't it?

                                     jessep
                         you see my problem is, of course, 
                         that i'm a colonel. i'll just have 
                         to keep taking cold showers 'til 
                         they elect some gal president.

                                     jo
                         i need an answer to my question, 
                         sir.

                                     jessep
                         take caution in your tone, commander.  
                         i'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' 
                         heat's making me absolutely crazy. 
                         you want to know about code reds?  
                         on the record i tell you that i 
                         discourage the practice in accordance 
                         with the nis directive. off the record 
                         i tell you that it's an invaluable 
                         part of close infantry training, and 
                         if it happens to go on without my 
                         knowledge, so be it. i run my base 
                         how i run my base. you want to 
                         investigate me, roll the dice and 
                         take your chances. i eat breakfast 
                         80 yards away from 4000 cubans who 
                         are trained to kill me. so don't for 
                         one second think you're gonna come 
                         down here, flash a badge, and make 
                         me nervous.

               a moment of tense silence before --

                                     kaffee
                         let's go. colonel, i'll just need a

                                     jessep

                         that i'm here to help anyway i can?

                                     jessep
                         the corporal'll run you by ordinance 
                         on your way out to the airstrip. you 
                         can have all the transfer orders you 
                         want.

                                     jessep
                         you have to ask me nicely. you see, 
                         danny, i can deal with the bullets 
                         and the bombs and the blood. i can 
                         deal with the heat and the stress 
                         and the fear. i don't want money and 
                         i don't want medals. what i want is 
                         for you to stand there in that faggoty 
                         white uniform, and with your harvard 
                         mouth, extend me some fuckin' 
                         courtesy. you gotta ask me nicely.

               kaffee and jessep are frozen. everyone'staring at kaffee; 
               the officers at their tables... kendrick... sam...

                         colonel jessep... if it's not too 
                         much trouble, i'd like a copy of the 
                         transfer order. sir.

               jessep smiles.

                                     jessep
                         no problem.

               hold for a moment. jo's very disappointed.

               jessep stands there and watches the lawyers as they turn and 
               leave the officer's club.

                              (continuing)
                         i hate casualties, matthew. there 
                         are casualties even in victory. a 
                         marine smothers a grenade and saves 
                         his platoon, that marine's a hero. 
                         the foundation of the unit, the fabric 
                         of this base, the spirit of the corps, 
                         they are things worth fighting for.

               markinson looks at the ground.

                              (continuing)
                         dawson and downey, they don't know 
                         it, but they're smothering a grenade.

               markinson looks up as we

                                                                    cut to:
