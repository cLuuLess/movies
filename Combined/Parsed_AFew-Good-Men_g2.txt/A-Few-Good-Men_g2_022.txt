               kaffee in his car

               he's driving down a washington street and pulls over at a 
               sidewalk newsstand.

               he gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and 
               runs up to the newsstand.

               as he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he 
               engages in his daily ritual with luther, the newsstand 
               operator.
