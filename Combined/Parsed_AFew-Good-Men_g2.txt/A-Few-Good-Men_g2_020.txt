               int.  kaffee's office - day

               he's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the 
               work day. lt. jack ross, a marine lawyer maybe two years 
               older than kaffee, opens the door and walks in..

                                     ross
                         dan kaffee.

                                     kaffee
                         sailin' jack ross.

                                     ross
                         welcome to the big time.

                                     kaffee
                         you think so?

                                     ross
                         i hope for dawson and downey's sake 
                         you practice law better than you 
                         play softball.

                                     kaffee
                         unfortunately for dawson and downey, 
                         i don't do anything better than i 
                         play softball. what are we lookin' 
                         at?

                                     ross
                         they plead guilty to manslaughter, 
                         i'll drop the conspiracy and the 
                         conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll 
                         be home in half that time.

                                     kaffee
                         i want twelve.

                                     ross
                         can't do it.

                                     kaffee
                         they called the ambulance, jack.

                                     ross
                         i don't care if they called the avon 
                         lady, they killed a marine.

                                     kaffee
                         the rag was tested for poison.  the 
                         autopsy, lab report, even the initial 
                         e.r. and c.o.d. reports. they all 
                         say the same thing: maybe, maybe 
                         not.

                                     ross
                         the chief of internal medicine at 
                         the guantanamo bay naval hospital 
                         says he's sure.

                                     kaffee
                         what do you know about code reds?

               ross smiles and shakes his head.

                                     ross
                         oh man.

               he closes the office door.

                                     ross
                              (continuing)
                         are we off the record?

                                     kaffee
                         you tell me.

                                     ross
                              (pause)
                         i'm gonna give you the twelve years, 
                         but before you go getting yourself 
                         into trouble tomorrow, you should 
                         know this: the platoon commander lt. 
                         jonathan kendrick, had a meeting 
                         with the men. and he specifically 
                         told them not to touch santiago.

               kaffee holds for a moment. dawson and downey neglected to 
               mention this... he packs up his briefcase and cleats.

                                     kaffee
                         i'll talk to you when i get back.

                                     ross
                         hey, we got a little four-on-four 
                         going tomorrow night. when does your 
                         plane get in?

                                                                    cut to:
