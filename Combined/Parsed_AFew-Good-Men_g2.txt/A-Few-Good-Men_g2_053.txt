               int. kaffee's apartment - night

               a baseball game is on.

               kaffee's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. 
               he's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room.

               he's studying it. studying it hard. there's a knock on the 
               door. kaffee answers it. jo is standing in the doorway.

                                     jo
                         i'm sorry to bother you, i should've 
                         called first.

                                     kaffee
                         no, i was just watching a baseball 
                         game.

                                     jo
                         i was wondering if -- how you'd feel 
                         about my taking you to dinner tonight.

                                     kaffee
                         jo, are you asking me out on a date?

                                     jo
                         no.

                                     kaffee
                         it sounded like you were asking me 
                         out on a date.

                                     jo
                         i wasn't.

                                     kaffee
                         i've been asked out on dates before, 
                         and that's what it sounded like.

                                     jo

                         seafood place.
