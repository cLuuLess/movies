                         take off and land every day? a kid 
                         from the ground crew isn't gonna 
                         remember a flight that landed four

                         jessep's refusal to transfer santiago 
                         and he'll testify to the forged 
                         transfer order. that'll be enough.

                         oughta be enough.
