               another red-brick building. a few m.p.is stand out front as 
               the cars pull up. as soon as they come to a stop, all the 
               doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed 
               officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they 
               escort dawson and downey, in handcuffs, out of the car.  
               harold dawson's a handsome, young, black corporal. intense, 
               controlled, and utterly professional.

               louden downey's a 19-year-old kid off an iowa farm. he's 
               happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.

               dawson's his hero.

               the two prisoners stand still for a moment. they might as 
               we'll be in oz.

                                     downey
                         hal?

               dawson doesn't say anything.

                                     downey
                              (continuing)
                         is this washington, d.c.?

                         alright, let's move.
