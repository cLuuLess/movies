               int. the courtroom - day

               a few more m.p.'s are standing around. the jurors, nine 
               enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, 
               ross is at his table looking through some papers, and dawson 
               and downey, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. 
               the trial in a few moments from being underway and a few 
               people are milling about. kaffee walks down the aisle but is 
               stopped by a voice behind him.

                                     man (o.s.)
                         lieutenant kaffee?

               kaffee turns around to see a man and woman who are clearly 
               dawson's parents.

                                     man
                         you're gonna save our son, aren't 
                         you?

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         i'll do my best.

               kaffee continues on and stops next to jo, who's talking with 
               a woman in her mid-30's.

                                     jo
                         danny, i want you to meet ginny 
                         miller, louden's aunt.

                                     kaffee
                         you're aunt ginny?

                                     ginny
                         uh-huh.

                                     kaffee
                         i'm sorry, i was expecting someone  
                         older.

                                     ginny
                         so was i.

               not quite the words of inspiration kaffee was hoping to hear 
               before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

               he walks over to ross.

                                     kaffee
                         last chance. i'll flip you for it.

               randolph enters.

                                     sergeant at arms
                         all rise.

                                     ross
                         too late.

               kaffee walks back to his table as

                                     sergeant at arms
                         all those having business with this 
                         general court-martial, stand forward 
                         and you shall be heard. captain julius 
                         alexander randolph is presiding. god 
                         save the united states of america.

               randolph raps the gavel.

               randolph without objection, the sworn confessions of the two 
               defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the 
               court record.

                                     ross
                         no objection, your honor.

                                     kaffee
                         no objection.

                                     randolph
                         is the government prepared to make 
                         an opening statement?

                                     ross
                              (standing)
                         yes sir.

               ross walks to the jury box.

                                     ross
                              (continuing)
                         the facts of the case are this: at 
                         midnight on august 6th, the defendants 
                         went into the barracks room of their 
                         platoon-mate, pfc william santiago.  
                         they woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. a few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. he 
                         drowned in his own blood and was 
                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
                         midnight. these are the facts of the 
                         case. and they are undisputed. that's 
                         right. the story i just told you is 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from corporal dawson, and it's 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from private downey. furthermore, 
                         the government will also demonstrate 
                         that the defendants soaked the rag 
                         with poison, and entered santiago's 
                         room with motive and intent to kill.
                              (beat)
                         now, lt. kaffee, is gonna try to 
                         pull off a little magic act, he's 
                         gonna try a little misdirection. 
                         he's going to astonish you with 
                         stories of rituals and dazzle you 
                         with official sounding terms like 
                         code red. he might even cut into a 
                         few officers for you. he'll have no 
                         evidence, mind you, none. but it's 
                         gonna be entertaining. when we get 
                         to the end, all the magic in the 
                         world will not have been able to 
                         divert your attention from the fact 
                         that willy santiago is dead, and 
                         dawson and downey killed him. these 
                         are the facts of the case.
                              (beat)
                         and they are undisputed.

               ross walks back to his seat.

                                     randolph
                         lt. kaffee?

               before kaffee's even stood up, these words are coming out of 
               his mouth.

                                     kaffee
                         there was no poison on the rag and 
                         there was no intent to kill and any 
                         attempt to prove otherwise is futile 
                         because it just ain't true.
                              (beat)
                         when dawson and downey went into 
                         santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
                         because of vengeance or hatred, it 
                         wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
                         because they were looking for kicks 
                         on a friday night. it's because it 
                         was what they were ordered to do.
                              (beat)
                         let me say that again: it's because 
                         it was what they were ordered to do. 
                         now, out in the real world, that 
                         means nothing. and here at the 
                         washington navy yard, it doesn't 
                         mean a whole lot more. but if you're 
                         a marine assigned to rifle security 
                         company windward, guantanamo bay, 
                         cuba, and you're given an order, you 
                         follow it or you pack your bags.
                              (beat)
                         make no mistake about it, harold 
                         dawson and louden downey are sitting 
                         before you in judgement today because 
                         they did their job.

               kaffee walks back to the table and takes his seat.

                                     randolph
                         is the government ready to call its 
                         first witness?

                                     ross
                         please the court, the government 
                         calls mr. r.c mcguire.

               while mccguire, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn 
               in, kaffee has sat back down.

               he leans over to dawson and whispers.

                                     kaffee
                         how you doin'?

               dawson doesn't change his expression.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         good.

                                     ross
                         mr. mcguire, would you state your 
                         full name and occupation for the 
                         record, please?

                                     mcguire
                         robert c. mcguire, special agent, 
                         naval investigative service.

                                     ross
                         mr. mcguire, did your office receive 
                         a letter from pfc william santiago 
                         on 3 august of this year?

                                     mcguire
                         we did.

                                     ross
                         what did the letter say?

                                     mcguire
                         that a member of private santiago's 
                         unit had illegally fired his weapon 
                         over the fenceline.

                                     ross
                         was that marine identified in the 
                         letter?

                                     mcguire
                         no sir. i notified the barracks c.o., 
                         colonel jessep, that i would be coming 
                         down to investigate.

                                     ross
                         and what did you find?

                                     mcguire
                         for the shift reported, only one 
                         sentry returned his weapon to the 
                         switch with a round of ammunition 
                         missing.

                                     ross
                         and who was that?

                                     mcguire
                         lance corporal harold dawson.

                              (continuing; to kaffee)
                         your witness.

               ross goes back to his table. kaffee stands.

                                     kaffee
                         mr. mcguire, have you questioned 
                         corporal dawson about the fenceline 
                         shooting?

                                     mcguire
                         yes. he claims to have been engaged 
                         in some manner by the enemy.

                                     kaffee
                         but you don't believe him.

                                     mcguire
                         it's not my place --

                                     kaffee
                         corporal dawson's been charged with 
                         a number of crimes, why wasn't he 
                         charged with firing at the enemy 
                         without cause?

                                     mcguire
                         there wasn't enough evidence to 
                         support such a charge.

                                     kaffee
                         thank you.

               kaffee sits.

                                     ross
                         mr. mcguire, i don't understand what 
                         you mean when you say there wasn't 
                         enough evidence to support such a 
                         charge. you had willy santiago's 
                         letter.

                                     mcguire
                         santiago was the only witness, but i 
                         never had a chance to interview him. 
                         so i don't know what he saw.

                                     ross
                         and now we won't ever know, will we,

                         corporal, were you present at a 
                         meeting that lt. kendrick held on 
                         the afternoon of august 6th with the 
                         members of second platoon.

                                     hammaker
                         yes sir.

                                     ross
                         would you tell the court the substance 
                         of that meeting?

                                     hammaker
                         lt. kendrick told us that we had an 
                         informer in our group.  that private 
                         santiago had gone outside the chain 
                         of command and reported to the nis 
                         on a member of our platoon.

                         did that make you mad?
                              (pause)
                         you can tell the truth, corporal, 
                         it's alright. did it make you mad?

                                     hammaker
                         yes sir.

                                     ross
                         how mad?

                                     hammaker
                         private santiago betrayed a code 
                         that we believe in very deeply, sir.

                                     ross
                         were the other members of the squad 
                         angry?

                         please the court, is the judge 
                         advocate honestly asking this witness 
                         to testify as to how the defendant 
                         felt on august 6th?

                         corporal, did lt. kendrick leave a 
                         standing order at that meeting?

                                     randolph
                         yes sir.

                                     ross
                         what was it?

                                     hammaker
                         well it was clear that he didn't 
                         want us to take matters into our own 
                         hands, sir.

                                     ross
                         what was the order?

                                     hammaker
                         sir, he said that santiago wasn't to 
                         be touched.

                                     ross
                              (to kaffee)
                         your witness.

                                     kaffee
                         corporal hammaker, were you in dawson 
                         and downey's barracks room ten minutes 
                         after this meeting?

                                     hammaker
                         no sir.

                                     kaffee
                         thanks, i have no more questions.

               hammaker gets off the stand, and kaffee watches while walks 
               past dawson and downey. a barely perceptible exchange occurs 
               between the eyes of dawson and hammaker.

               kaffee makes a decision.

                                     ross
                         the government calls corporal raymond

                                     kaffee
                         please the court, i understand lt.  
                         ross is planning on calling all the 
                         other members of rifle security 
                         company windward to testify.

                                     ross
                         in light of the defense that lt.  
                         kaffee is planning to mount, the 
                         explicit instructions of the platoon 
                         leader seems particularly relevant 
                         testimony.

                                     kaffee
                         the defense is willing to concede 
                         that all 23 witnesses will testify 
                         substantially as corporal hammaker 
                         did, if the government is willing to 
                         concede that none of them were in 
                         dawson and downey's room at 16:20 on 
                         august 6th.

                                     ross
                         the government'll agree to the 
                         stipulation, sir.

                                     randolph
                         then we'll adjourn for the day. you 
                         can call your next witness in the 
                         morning.
