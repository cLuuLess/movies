               int. jo's office - day

               jo sits behind her desk. kaffee and sam stand in the doorway. 
               kaffee knocks politely.

               jo looks up.

                                     kaffee
                         hi.
                              (beat)
                         i'm daniel kaffee. i was told to 
                         meet with --
                              (checks notes)
                         -- commander galloway.

               jo is staring at him. kaffee doesn't know why.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         about a briefing.

               jo is finding this hard to believe.

                                     jo
                         you're the attorney that division 
                         assigned?

                                     kaffee
                         i'm lead counsel. this is sam 
                         weinberg.

                                     sam
                         i have no responsibilities here 
                         whatsoever.

               jo's deeply puzzled.

                                     jo
                              (beat)
                         come in, please, have a seat...

               kaffee and sam come into the office and sit.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         lieutenant, how long have you been 
                         in the navy?

                                     kaffee
                         going on nine months now.

                                     jo
                         and how long have you been out of 
                         law school?

                                     kaffee
                         a little over a year.

                                     jo
                              (beat)
                         i see.

                                     kaffee
                         have i done something wrong?

                                     jo
                         no. it's just that when i petitioned 
                         division to have counsel assigned, i 
                         was hoping i'd be taken seriously.

               kaffee and sam exchange a look.

                                     kaffee
                              (to jo)
                         no offense taken, if you were 
                         wondering.

                                     sam
                         commander, lt. kaffee's generally 
                         considered the best litigator in our 
                         office. he's successfully plea 
                         bargained 44 cases in nine months.

                                     kaffee
                         one more, and i got a set of steak 
                         knives.

                                     jo
                         have you ever been in a courtroom?

                                     kaffee
                         i once had my drivers license 
                         suspended.

                                     sam

                                     kaffee
                         commander, from what i understand, 
                         if this thing goes to court, they 
                         won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
                         priest.

                                     jo
                         no. they'll need a lawyer.

               during this, she'll hand kaffee a series of files, which 
               kaffee will pass to sam without even glancing at them.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         dawson's family has been contacted.  
                         downey's closest living relative is 
                         ginny miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side, she hasn't been contacted yet.

               none of this really means anything to kaffee.

                                     jo
                              (continuing)
                         would you like me to take care of 
                         that?

                                     kaffee
                         sure, if you feel like it.

               jo takes another beat to size this guy up.

                                     jo
                         one of the people you'll be speaking 
                         to down there is the barracks c.o., 
                         colonel nathan jessep, i assume you've 
                         heard of him.

                              (beat)
                         who hasn't?

                         he's been in the papers lately. he's 
                         expected to be appointed director of 
                         operations for the national security 
                         counsel.

               passing kaffee another file --

                         these are letters that santiago wrote 
                         in his 8 months at gitmo --

                         he wrote to his recruiter, the fleet 
                         commander, hq, atlantic, even his 
                         senator. he wanted a transfer. nobody 
                         was listening. you with me?

                                     kaffee
                         yes.

                         in exchange for a transfer, was just 
                         a last ditch effort.

                         right. is that all?

                         lieutenant, this letter makes it 
                         look like your client had a motive 
                         to kill santiago.

                              (to jo)
                         am i correct in assuming that these 
                         letters don't paint a flattering 
                         picture of marine corps life in

                         and am i further right in assuming 
                         that a protracted investigation of 
                         this incident might cause some

                         you haven't talked to a witness, you 
                         haven't looked at a piece of paper.

                         pretty impressive, huh?

                         my job is to make sure you do your 
                         job. i'm special counsel for internal 
                         affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty 
                         much in your face. read the letters. 
                         you're not under any obligation, but 
                         i'd appreciate a report when you get 
                         back from cuba.
