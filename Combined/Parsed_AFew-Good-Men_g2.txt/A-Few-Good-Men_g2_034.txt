               int. a holding room - night

               kaffee and jo are sitting at a table. dawson and downey are 
               at parade rest. kaffee lights a cigarette.

                                     kaffee
                         here's the story: the goverment's 
                         offering assault and conduct 
                         unbecoming. two years. you'll be 
                         home in six months.

               dawson and downey say nothing.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         "wow, kaffee, you're the greatest 
                         lawyer in the world. how can we ever 
                         thank you?" fellas, you hear what i 
                         just said, you're going home in six 
                         months.

                                     dawson
                         i'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         do what?

                                     dawson
                         make a deal, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         what are you talking about?

                                     dawson
                         we did nothing wrong, sir. we did 
                         our job. if that has consequences, 
                         then i accept them. but'i won't say 
                         i'm guilty, sir.

               kaffee can't believe this. he looks over at jo.

                                     kaffee
                         did you --
                              (to dawson and downey)
                         did she put you up to this?

                                     jo
                         no.

                                     dawson
                         we have a code, sir.

                                     kaffee
                         well zippity-doo-dah. you and your 
                         code plead not guilty and you'll be 
                         in jail for the rest of your life. 
                         do what i'm telling you and you'll 
                         be home in six months.

               dawson just stares at him.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         do it, harold. six months. it's 
                         nothing. it's a hockey season.

                                     dawson
                         permission to --

                                     kaffee
                         speak!

                                     dawson
                         what do we do then, sir?

                                     kaffee
                         when?

                                     dawson
                         after six months. we'd be dishonorably 
                         discharged, right sir?

                                     kaffee
                         yes.

                                     dawson
                         what do we do then, sir? we joined 
                         the corps 'cause we wanted to live 
                         our lives by a certain code. and we 
                         found it in the corps. and now you're 
                         asking us to sign a piece of paper 
                         that says we have no honor. you're 
                         asking us to say we're not marines. 
                         if a judge and jury decide that what 
                         we did was wrong, i'll accept whatever 
                         punishment they give. but i believe 
                         i was riqht, sir. i believe i did my 
                         job. and i won't dishonor myself, my 
                         unit, or the corps, so that i can qo 
                         home in six months.
                              (beat)
                         sir.

               hold on the four of them for a moment, then

                                     kaffee
                         commander, i want to talk to corporal 
                         dawson alone for a minute.

               jo waits just a moment before she calls out --

                                     jo
                              (to downey)
                         let's go in another room. louden, 
                         everything's gonna be alright.

               the m.p. has shown up and unlocked the cell door.

                                     jo
                              (continuing; to m.p.)
                         we're gonna go into a holding room.

                                     m.p.
                         aye, aye, ma'am.

               jo, downey, and the m.p. are gone. kaffee paces a moment 
               before he says --

                                     kaffee
                         you don't like me that much, do you?
                              (beat)
                         forget it, don't answer that, it 
                         doesn't matter.

               kaffee paces another moment, then sits on the cot. he's trying 
               to choose his tack carefully.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         you know, downey worships you. he's 
                         gonna do whatever you do. are you 
                         really gonna let this happen to him 
                         because of a code? harold?

                                     dawson
                         do you think we were right?

                                     kaffee
                         it doesn't matter what i --

                                     dawson
                         do you think we were right?

               kaffee gets up.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         i think you'd lose.

                                     dawson
                              (beat)
                         you're such a coward, i can't believe 
                         they let you wear a uniform.

               kaffee stares at dawson.

                                     kaffee
                         i'm not gonna feel responsible for 
                         this, harold. i did everything i 
                         could. you're going to levenworth 
                         for the better part of your life, 
                         and you know what? i don't give a 
                         shit.

               kaffee calls out --

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         m.p.!

               kaffee and dawson are staring each other down. the m.p. shows 
               up and unlocks the cell door. kaffee steps out to leave.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         what happened to saluting an officer 
                         when he leaves the room?

               dawson holds on kaffee. then dawson, a man who would rather 
               die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts 
               them in his pockets.

               the cell door closes and we

                                                                    cut to:
