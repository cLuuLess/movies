               int. kaffee's apartment - night

               where kaffee has just finished telling his story to an amazed 
               sam and jo.

               there's silence.

               then jo has a total adrenaline rush.

                                     jo
                         where is he?

                                     kaffee
                         the route 23 best western.

               jo picks up the phone.

                                     jo
                         i want him guarded.

                                     kaffee
                         that's probably a good idea.

                                     jo
                              (into phone)

               kaffee is impressed. he turns to sam --

                                     kaffee
                         clearance code?

                                     jo
                         thank you.

                                     kaffee
                              (to sam)

                         you have a --

                                     jo
                              (into phone)
                         it's jo galloway. i need to secure a 
                         witness.

               jo continues giving information to the person on the phone, 
               while kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. sam is writing 
               down notes as fast as he can.

                                     kaffee
                         he also said that jessep's lying 
                         about the transportation off the 
                         base. jessep said six the next morning 
                         was the first flight santiago could've 
                         left on, markinson says there was a 
                         plane that left seven hours earlier.

               jo hangs up the phone.

                                     jo
                         damn.

                                     kaffee
                         that was impressive. did you hear 
                         what i just said about the flight?

                                     jo
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         sam, when a plane takes off from a 
                         base, there's gotta be some kind of 
                         record kept, right?

                                     sam
                         we need the tower chief's log for 
                         gitmo.

                                     kaffee
                              (to sam)
                         get it.

                                     jo
                         we're gonna win.

                                     kaffee
                         jo, don't get crazy about this. we 
                         don't know who markinson is. we don't 
                         know what the log book's gonna say. 
                         you just concentrate on downey. i'm 
                         gonna talk to ross and tell him where 
                         we are.

                                     jo
                              (sing-song)
                         "kaffee's got his case now, kaffee's 
                         got his case now."

                                     kaffee
                         you are like seven of the strangest 
                         women i have ever met.

                                                                    cut to:
