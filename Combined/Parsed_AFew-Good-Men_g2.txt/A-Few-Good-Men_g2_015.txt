               int.  jessep's office - day

               the letter - day

               it's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing, 
               and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding 
               it.

                                     santiago (v.o.)
                         "p.s. in exchange for my transfer 
                         off the base, i'm willing to provide 
                         you with information about an illegal 
                         fenceline shooting that occurred the 
                         night of august 2nd."

               and as these last words are spoken, we pull back to reveal 
               colonel nathan r. jessep, who drops the letter he's been 
               reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters 
               just like it.

               jessep's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one 
               of the real fair-haired boys of the corps. he's smart as a 
               whip with a sense of humor to match. as soon as he drops the 
               letter, he says

                                     jessep
                         who the fuck is pfc william t. 
                         santiago.

               he's talking to his two senior officers. captain markinson 
               is in his late 40's. he's a career marine and a nice guy in 
               a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure 
               as shit don't finish first. lt. jonathan james kendrick is 
               26, from georgia, and an academy graduate.

               if you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are 
               guarded by the u.s. marine corps.

                                     kendrick
                         sir, santiago is a member of second 
                         platoon, delta.

                                     jessep
                         yeah, well, apparently he's not very 
                         happy down here at shangri-la, cause 
                         he's written letters to everyone but 
                         santa claus asking for a transfer. 
                         and now he's telling tales about a 
                         fenceline shooting.

               he tosses the letter over to markinson. markinson is looking 
               it over. jessep is waiting for a response.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         matthew?

                                     markinson
                         i'm appalled, sir.

                                     jessep
                         you're appalled? this kid broke the 
                         chain of command and he ratted on a 
                         man of his unit, to say nothing of 
                         the fact that he's a u.s. marine and 
                         it would appear that he can't run 
                         from here to there without collapsing 
                         from heat exhaustion. what the fuck's 
                         going on over at windward, matthew?

                                     markinson
                         colonel, i think perhaps it would be 
                         better to hold this discussion in 
                         private.

                                     kendrick
                         that won't be necessary, colonel, 
                         i'll handle the situation.

                                     markinson
                         the same way you handled the curtis 
                         barnes incident? you're doing 
                         something wrong, lieutenant this --

                                     kendrick
                         my methods of leadership are --

                                     markinson
                         don't interrupt me, i'm still your 
                         superior officer.

                                     jessep
                         and i'm yours, matthew.

               the room calms down for a moment.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         i want to know what we're gonna do 
                         about this.

                                     markinson
                         i think santiago should be transferred 
                         off the base. right away.

                                     jessep
                         he's that bad, huh?

                                     markinson
                         not only that, but word of this 
                         letter's bound to get out. the kid's 
                         gonna get his ass kicked.

                                     jessep
                         transfer santiago. yes i suppose 
                         you're right. i suppose that's the 
                         thing to do. wait. wait. i've got a 
                         better idea. let's transfer the whole 
                         squad off the base. let's -- on second 
                         thought -- windward. the whole 
                         windward division, let's transfer 
                         'em off the base. jon, go on out 
                         there and get those boys down off 
                         the fence, they're packing their 
                         bags.
                              (calling out)
                         tom!

               the orderly cones in from the outer office.

                                     orderly
                         sir!

                                     jessep
                         got me the president on the phone, 
                         we're surrendering our position in 
                         cuba.

                                     orderly
                         yes sir!

                                     jessep
                         wait a minute, tom.

               the orderly stops.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         don't call the president just yet. 
                         maybe we should consider this for a 
                         second. maybe -- and i'm just spit 
                         balling here -- but maybe we as 
                         officers have a responsibility to 
                         train santiago. maybe we as officers 
                         have a responsibility to this country 
                         to see that the men and women charged 
                         with its security are trained 
                         professionals. yes. i'm certain i 
                         once read that somewhere. and now 
                         i'm thinking that your suggestion of 
                         transferring santiago, while 
                         expeditious, and certainly painless, 
                         might not be in a manner of speaking, 
                         the american way. santiago stays 
                         where he is. we're gonna train the 
                         lad. you're in charge, jon. santiago 
                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
                         report, i'm gonna blame you. then 
                         i'm gonna kill you.

                                     kendrick
                         yes sir.

                                     markinson
                         i think that's a mistake, colonel.

                                     jessep
                         matthew, i believe i will have that 
                         word in private with you now. jon, 
                         that's all. why don't you and i have 
                         lunch at the "o" club, we'll talk 
                         about the training of young william.

                                     kendrick
                         yes sir, i'd be delighted to hear 
                         any suggestions you have.

                                     jessep
                         dismissed.

               kendrick is gone.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         matthew, sit, please.

               markinson sits.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         what do you think of kendrick?

                                     markinson
                              (beat)
                         i don't know that --

                                     jessep
                         i think he's kind of a weasel, myself. 
                         but he's an awfully good officer, 
                         and in the end we see eye to eye on 
                         the best way to run a marine corps 
                         unit. we're in the business of saving 
                         lives, matthew. that's a 
                         responsibility we have to take pretty 
                         seriously. and i believe that taking 
                         a marine who's not yet up to the job 
                         and packing him off to another 
                         assignment, puts lives in danger.

               markinson starts to stand --

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         matthew, siddown.
                              (beat)
                         we go back a while. we went to the 
                         academy together, we were commissioned 
                         together, we did our tours in vietnam 
                         together. but i've been promoted up 
                         through the chain with greater speed 
                         and success than you have. now if 
                         that's a source of tension or 
                         embarrassment for you, well, i don't 
                         give a shit. we're in the business 
                         of saving lives, captain markinson. 
                         don't ever question my orders in 
                         front of another officer.

               jessep grabs his hat and walks out, leaving markinson sitting 
               all alone, and we

                                                                    cut to:
