               int. the office corridor - night

               one light is on at the end of the hall.

                                                                    cut to:

               sam has joined kaffee and jo. the mood is somber.

                                     kaffee
                         dawson's gonna go to jail just to 
                         spite me. fine. if he wants to jump 
                         off a cliff, that's his business. 
                         i'm not gonna hold his hand on the 
                         way down.
                              (to sam)
                         i want to get him a new lawyer. how 
                         do i do it?

                                     sam
                         you just make a motion tomorrow 
                         morning at the arraignment. the 
                         judge'll ask you if you want to enter 
                         a plea. you tell him you want new 
                         counsel assigned.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         then that's that.

                                     jo
                              (beat)
                         yeah. one thing, though. when you 
                         ask the judge for new counsel, danny, 
                         be sure and ask nicely.

                                     kaffee
                         what do you want from me?

                                     jo
                         i want you to let 'em be judged! i 
                         want you to stand up and make an 
                         argument!

                                     sam
                         an argument that didn't work for 
                         calley at my lai, an argument that 
                         didn't work for the nazis at 
                         nuremberg.

                                     kaffee
                         for christ sake, sam, do you really 
                         think that's the same as two teenage 
                         marines executing a routine order 
                         that they never believed would result 
                         in harm? these guys aren't the nazis.

               there's a pause in the room.

                                     jo
                         don't look now, danny, but you're 
                         making an argument.

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         yeah.
                              (beat)
                         tomorrow morning i'll get them a new 
                         attorney.

                                     jo
                         why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? 
                         were daddy's expectations really 
                         that high?

                                     kaffee
                         please, spare me the psycho-babble 
                         father bullshit. dawson and downey'll 
                         have their day in court, but they'll 
                         have it with another lawyer.

                                     jo
                         another lawyer won't be good enough. 
                         they need you. you know how to win.
                              (beat)
                         you know they have a case. and you 
                         know how to win. you walk away from 
                         this now, and you have sealed their 
                         fate.

                                     kaffee
                         their fate was sealed the moment 
                         santiago died.

                                     jo
                         do you believe they have a defense?

                                     kaffee
                         you and dawson both live in the same 
                         dreamland. it doesn't matter what i 
                         believe, it only matters what i can 
                         prove. so please don't tell me what 
                         i know and don't know. i know the 
                         law.

               jo looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away.  
               she turns back.

                                     jo
                         you know nothing about the law. you're 
                         a used car salesman, daniel. you're 
                         an ambulance chaser with a rank. 
                         you're nothing.
                              (beat)
                         live with that.

               jo walks off leaving kaffee alone. we hold on kaffee. he's 
               not having a good night.

                                                                    cut to:
