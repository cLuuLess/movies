               int. the courtroom - late afternoon

               there's low murmur in the room as the jurors are being led 
               back into their box.

               everyone's in place.

               randolph enters.

                                     sergeant at arms
                         ten-hut.

               all rise. and sit when randolph sits.

                                     randolph
                         have the jurors reached a verdict?

                                     jury foreman
                         we have, sir.

               the sergeant at arms takes all the slips of paper from the 
               foreman and brings them to randolph.

               kaffee stands, and nods to dawson and downey that they should 
               do the same. sam and jo stand as well.

                                     randolph
                              (reading)
                         on the charge of murder, the members 
                         find the defendants not guilty.

               it's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but 
               they do.

                                     randolph
                              (continuing; reading)
                         on the charge of conspiracy to commit 
                         murder, the members find the 
                         defendants not guilty.

               randolph looks up. then reads from the last slip of paper.

                                     randolph
                              (continuing)
                         on the charge of conduct unbecoming 
                         a united states marine, the members 
                         find the defendants guilty as charged.

               a little of the energy drains out of the room. randolph 
               continues reading.

                                     randolph
                              (continuing; reading)
                         the defendants are hereby sentenced 
                         by this court to time already served, 
                         and are ordered...

               randolph clears his throat.

                                     randolph
                              (continuing)
                         ...and are ordered to be dishonorably 
                         discharged from the marine corps.
                              (pause)
                         this court-martial is adjourned.

               randolph raps his gavel.

                                     sergeant at arms
                         ten hut.

               all rise.

               randolph's gone.

                                     sergeant at arms
                              (continuing)
                         dismissed.

               the m.p.'s move to dawson and downey to unlock their 
               handcuffs. kaffee is packing up his things, just another day 
               at the office.

                                     dawson
                         why?

                                     kaffee
                         harold, i'm sorry.

                                     dawson
                         why?!

                                     downey
                         i don't understand. colonel jessep 
                         said he ordered the code red.

                                     jo
                         i know, but --

                                     downey
                         colonel jessep said he ordered the 
                         code red, what did we do wrong?

                                     jo
                         it's not as simple as --

                                     downey
                         what did we do wrong?

                                     dawson
                         we did nothing wrong.

               sam slaps his hands down on the table --

                                     sam
                         yes you did! a jury just said your 
                         conduct was unbecoming a marine. 
                         what does that mean?!

                                     dawson
                         you're the lawyer.

                                     sam
                         you're the marine.

                                     dawson
                         not anymore.

               sam lets it hang. dawson is staring at sam. his stare moves 
               slowly to the floor.

                                     dawson
                              (continuing)
                         i never meant to hurt willy.

               dawson looks up at his parents. the moment hangs there... 
               before

                                     sergeant at arms
                         kaffee, i've gotta take these guys 
                         over to personnel for some paper 
                         work.

               kaffee nods.

                                     sergeant at arms
                              (continuing; to dawson 
                              & downey)
                         gentleman?

               dawson looks to kaffee. there's gotta be more. this can't be 
               it.

               but kaffee has nothing to say.

               dawson and downey walk to the sergeant at arms and begin to 
               follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. but before 
               they get to the door, kaffee turns around and calls

                                     kaffee
                         harold!

               they stop and turn around.

                                     dawson
                         sir!

                                     kaffee
                              (pause)
                         you don't need to wear a patch on 
                         your arm to have honor.

               dawson stares at kaffee for a long moment.

                                     dawson
                         ten-hut.

               dawson and downey come to attention.

                                     dawson
                              (continuing)
                         there's an officer on deck.

               dawson snaps a salute and holds it.

               kaffee stares back. then stands up straight and returns their 
               salute.

               with one last glance back at kaffee, dawson turns and walks 
               out the door, followed by downey.

               ross walks over to the defense table.

                                     ross
                         airmen cecil o'malley and anthony 
                         perez? what exactly were these guys 
                         gonna testify to?

                                     kaffee
                         unless i'm mistaken they were gonna 
                         testify, under oath, that they have 
                         absolutely no recollection of 
                         anything.

               ross smiles.

                                     ross
                         strong witnesses.

                                     kaffee
                         and very handsome, too, don't you 
                         think?

                                     ross
                         i'll see you around the campus.  
                         i've gotta go arrest kendrick.

                                     kaffee
                         tell him i say "hi".

                                     ross
                         will do.

                                                                    cut to:
