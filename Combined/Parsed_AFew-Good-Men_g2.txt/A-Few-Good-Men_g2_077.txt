                         but the truth so help you god?

                                     jessep
                         yes i do.

                                     ross
                         would you state your name, rank, and 
                         current billet for the record please,

                         guantanamo bay, cuba.

                                     ross
                         thank you, sir, would you have a 
                         seat, please.

               jessep sits.

                                     kaffee
                         colonel, when you learned of 
                         santiago's letter to the nis, you 
                         had a meeting with your two senior 
                         officers, is that right?

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         the executive officer, lt. jonathan 
                         kendrick, and the company commander, 
                         captain matthew markinson.

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         and at present, captain markinson is 
                         dead, is that right?

                                     ross
                         objection. i'd like to know just 
                         what defense counsel is implying?

                                     kaffee
                         i'm implying simply that, at present, 
                         captain markinson is not alive.

                                     ross
                         surely colonel jessep doesn't need 
                         to appear in this courtroom to confirm 
                         that information.

                                     kaffee
                         i just wasn't sure if the witness 
                         was aware that two days ago, captain 
                         markinson took his own life with a 
                         .45 caliber pistol.

               and from the back of the room, sam enters. he's escorting 
               two young airmen in airforce dress uniforms. sam shows the 
               airmen to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the 
               defense table.

               over this we hear --

                                     randolph (o.s.)
                         the witness is aware, the court is 
                         aware, and now the jury is aware. we 
                         thank you for bringing this to our 
                         attention. move on lieutenant.

               sam scribbles something on a piece of paper, kaffee walks 
               over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: 
               cecil o'malley and anthony perez, then turns back to randolph.

                                     kaffee
                         yes sir. colonel, at the time of 
                         this meeting, you gave lt. kendrick 
                         an order, is that right?

                                     jessep
                         i told kendrick to tell his men that 
                         santiago wasn't to be touched.

                                     kaffee
                         and did you give an order to captain 
                         markinson as well?

                                     jessep
                         i ordered markinson to have santiago 
                         transferred off the base immediately.

                                     kaffee
                         why?

                                     jessep
                         i felt that his life might be in 
                         danger once word of the letter got 
                         out.

                                     kaffee
                         grave danger?

                                     jessep
                         is there another kind?

               kaffee holds up a document from his table.

                                     kaffee
                         we have the transfer order that you 
                         and markinson co-signed, ordering 
                         that santiago be lifted on a flight 
                         leaving guantanamo at six the next 
                         morning. was that the first flight 
                         off the bass?

                                     jessep
                         the six a.m. flight was the first 
                         flight off the base.

               kaffee nods and decides to move on.

               jessep steals a quick glance at the two airmen sitting out 
               in the courtroom.

                                     kaffee
                         colonel, you flew up to washington 
                         early this morning, is that right?

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         i notice you're wearing your class a 
                         appearance in dress uniform for court 
                         today.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         as are you, lieutenant.

                                     kaffee
                         did you wear that uniform on the 
                         plane?

                                     ross
                         please the court, is this dialogue 
                         relevant to anything in particular?

                                     kaffee
                         the defense didn't have an opportunity 
                         to depose this witness, your honor.  
                         i'd ask the court for a little 
                         latitude.

                                     randolph
                         a very little latitude.

                              (to ross)
                         is the colonel's underwear a matter 
                         of national security?

                         gentlemen.
                              (to kaffee)

                         this, lieutenant.

                         records from gitmo for august 6th.  
                         and these are 14 letters that santiago 
                         wrote in nine months requesting, in 
                         fact begging, for a transfer.
                              (to jessep)
                         upon hearing the news that he was 
                         finally getting his transfer, santiago 
                         was so excited, that do you know how 
                         many people he called? zero. nobody. 
                         not one call to his parents saying 
                         he was coming home. not one call to 
                         a friend saying can you pick me up 
                         at the airport. he was asleep in his 
                         bed at midnight, and according to 
                         you he was getting on a plane in six 
                         hours, yet everything he owned was 
                         hanging neatly in his closet and 
                         folded neatly in his footlocker. you 
                         were leaving for one day and you 
                         packed a bag and made three phone 
                         calls. santiago was leaving for the 
                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
                         can you explain that? the fact is 
                         there was no transfer order. santiago 
                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
                         right, colonel.

                                     ross
                         object. your honor, it's obvious 
                         that lt. kaffee's intention this 
                         morning is to smear a high ranking 
                         marine officer in the desperate hope 
                         that the mere appearance of 
                         impropriety will win him points with 
                         the jury. it's my recommendation, 
                         sir, that lt. kaffee receive an 
                         official reprimand from the bench, 
                         and that the witness be excused with 
                         the court's deepest apologies.

               randolph ponders this a moment.

                                     randolph
                              (pause)
                         overruled.

                                     ross
                         your honor --

                                     randolph
                         the objection's noted.

                                     kaffee
                              (beat)
                         colonel?

               jessep's smiling...

               ...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         is this funny, sir?

                                     jessep
                         no. it's not. it's tragic.

                                     kaffee
                         do you have an answer?

                                     jessep
                         absolutely. my answer is i don't 
                         have the first damn clue. maybe he 
                         was an early morning riser and he 
                         liked to pack in the nq. and maybe 
                         he didn't have any friends. i'm an 
                         educated man, but i'm afraid i can't 
                         speak intelligently about the travel 
                         habits of william santiago.  what i 
                         do know is that he was set to leave 
                         the base at 0600. now are these really 
                         the questions i was called here to 
                         answer? phone calls and footlockers? 
                         please tell me you've got something 
                         more, lieutenant. please tell me 
                         there's an ace up your sleeve. these 
                         two marines are on trial for their 
                         lives. please tell me their lawyer 
                         hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
                         bill.
                              (beat)
                         do you have any other questions for 
                         me, counselor?

               the courtroom is silenced. jessep's slammed the door.

               kaffee looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting 
               for him to do something...

                                     randolph
                         lt. kaffee?

               kaffee says nothing. he glances over to airmen o'malley and 
               perez.

                                     randolph
                              (continuing)
                         lieutenant, do you have anything 
                         further for this witness?

               kaffee doesn't respond. jessep gets up to leave.

                                     jessep
                              (standing)
                         thanks, danny. i love washington.

               and jessep starts to leave, but he's stopped by --

                                     kaffee
                         excuse me, i didn't dismiss you.

               jessep turns around.

                                     jessep
                         i beg your pardon.

                                     kaffee
                         i'm not through with my examination. 
                         sit down.

                                     jessep
                         colonel.

                                     kaffee
                         what's that?

                                     jessep
                              (to randolph)
                         i'd appreciate it if he addressed me 
                         as colonel or sir. i believe i've 
                         earned it.

                                     randolph
                         defense counsel will address the 
                         witness as colonel or sir.

                                     jessep
                              (to randolph)
                         i don't know what the hell kind of 
                         an outfit you're running here.

                                     randolph
                         and the witness will address this 
                         court as judge or your honor. i'm 
                         quite certain i've earned it. take 
                         your seat, colonel.

               jessep goes back to the stand.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         what would you like to discuss now! 
                         my favorite color?

                                     kaffee
                         colonel, the six a.m. flight, was 
                         the first one off the base?

                                     jessep
                         yes.

                                     kaffee
                         there wasn't a flight that left seven 
                         hours earlier and landed at andrews 
                         airforce base at 2 a.m.?

                                     randolph
                         lieutenant, i think we've covered 
                         this, haven't we?

               kaffee gets the two log books from his table as well as the 
               piece of paper that sam scribbled on.

                                     kaffee
                         your honor, these are the tower 
                         chief's logs for both guantanamo bay 
                         and andrews airforce base. the 
                         guantanamo log lists no flight that 
                         left at eleven p.m., and the andrews 
                         log lists no flight that landed at 2 
                         a.m. i'd like to admit them as defense 
                         exhibits "a" and "b".

                                     randolph
                         i don't understand. you're admitting 
                         evidence of a flight that never 
                         existed?

                                     kaffee
                         we believe it did, sir.
                              (glancing at the paper, 
                              then motioning to 
                              the airmen)
                         defense'll be calling airman cecil 
                         o'malley and airman anthony perez. 
                         they were working the ground crew at 
                         andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.

                                     ross
                         your honor, these men weren't on the 
                         list. rebuttal witnesses, your honor, 
                         called specifically to refute 
                         testimony offered under direct 
                         examination.

               if you looked closely at jessep, you could see a drop of 
               sweat.

                                     randolph
                         i'll allow the witnesses.

                                     jessep
                         this is ridiculous.

                                     kaffee
                         colonel, a moment ago --

                                     jessep
                         check the tower logs for christ's 
                         sake.

                                     kaffee
                         we'll get to the airmen in just a 
                         minute, sir. a moment ago said that 
                         you ordered kendrick to order his 
                         men not to touch santiago.

                                     jessep
                         that's right.

                                     kaffee
                         and kendrick was clear on what you 
                         wanted?

                                     jessep
                         crystal.

                                     kaffee
                         any chance kendrick ignored the order?

                                     jessep
                         ignored the order?

                                     kaffee
                         any chance he just forgot about it?

                                     jessep
                         no.

                                     kaffee
                         any chance kendrick left your office 
                         and said, "the 'old man's wrong"?

                                     jessep
                         no.

                                     kaffee
                         when kendrick spoke to the platoon 
                         and ordered them not to touch 
                         santiago, any chance they ignored 
                         him?

                                     jessep
                         have you ever spent time in an 
                         infantry unit, son?

                                     kaffee
                         no sir.

                                     jessep
                         ever served in a forward area?

                                     kaffee
                         no sir.

                                     jessep
                         ever put your life in another man's

                         we follow orders, son. we follow 
                         orders or people die. it's that 
                         simple. are we clear?

                                     kaffee
                         yes sir.

                                     jessep
                         are we clear?

                              (continuing; beat)
                         colonel, i have just one more question 
                         before i call airman o'malley and 
                         airman perez: if you gave an order 
                         that santiago wasn't to be touched, 
                         and your orders are always followed, 
                         then why would he be in danger, why 
                         would it be necessary to transfer 
                         him off the base?

               and jessep has no answer.

               nothing.

               he sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.

                                     jessep
                         private santiago was a sub-standard 
                         marine. he was being transferred off 
                         the base because --

                                     kaffee
                         but that's not what you said. you 
                         said he was being transferred because 
                         he was in grave danger.

                                     jessep
                              (pause)
                         yes. that's correct, but --

                                     kaffee
                         you said, "he was in danger". i said, 
                         "grave danger". you said --

                                     jessep
                         yes, i recall what --

                         i know what i said. i don't need it 
                         read back to me like i'm a damn --

                                     kaffee
                         then why the two orders?

                         colonel?

                         why did you --

                                     jessep
                         sometimes men take matters into their 
                         own hands.

                                     kaffee
                         no sir. you made it clear just a 
                         moment ago that your men never take 
                         matters into their own hands. your 
                         men follow orders or people die. so 
                         santiago shouldn't have been in any 
                         danger at all, should he have, 
                         colonel?

               everyone's sweating now. everyone but kaffee.

                         your honor, i have to ask for a recess 
                         to --

                         i'd like an answer to the question, 
                         judge.

                                     randolph
                         the court'll wait for answer.

                                     kaffee
                         if kendrick told his men that santiago 
                         wasn't to be touched, then why did 
                         he have to be transferred?

               jessep is looking at o'malley and perez.

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         colonel?

               jessep says nothing.

                              (continuing)
                         kendrick ordered the code red, didn't 
                         he? because that's what you told 
                         kendrick to do.

                         i think i'm entitled to them.

                         you want answers?!

                                     kaffee
                         i want the truth.

                                     jessep
                         you can't handle the truth!

               and nobody moves.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         son, we live in a world that has 
                         walls. and those walls have to be 
                         guarded by men with guns. who's gonna 
                         do it? you? you, lt. weinberg? i 
                         have a greater responsibility than 
                         you can possibly fathom. you weep 
                         for santiago and you curse the 
                         marines. you have that luxury. you 
                         have the luxury of not knowing what 
                         i know: that santiago's death, while 
                         tragic, probably saved lives. and my 
                         existence, while grotesque and 
                         incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
                              (beat)
                         you don't want the truth. because 
                         deep down, in places you don't talk 
                         about at parties, you want me on 
                         that wall. you need me there.
                              (boasting)
                         we use words like honor, code, 
                         loyalty... we use these words as the 
                         backbone to a life spent defending 
                         something. you use 'em as a punchline.
                              (beat)
                         i have neither the time nor the 
                         inclination to explain myself to a 
                         man who rises and sleeps under the 
                         blanket of the very freedom i provide, 
                         then questions the manner in which i 
                         provide it. i'd prefer you just said 
                         thank you and went on your way. 
                         otherwise, i suggest you pick up a 
                         weapon and stand a post. either way, 
                         i don't give a damn what you think 
                         you're entitled to.

                         did you order the code red?

                         did you order the code red?

                         you're goddamn right i did.

               silence. from everyone. randolph, ross, the m.p.'s, they're 
               all frozen. jo and sam are likewise. jessep seems strangely, 
               quietly relieved. kaffee simply takes control of the room 
               now.

                                     kaffee
                         please the court, i suggest the jury 
                         be dismissed so that we can move to 
                         an immediate article 39a session.  
                         the witness has rights.

               silence.

               randolph looks to ross.

                                     randolph
                         lt. ross?

               ross is frozen. he doesn't know what to do.

               ross looks at kaffee, then jessep, then nods his head "yes" 
               to randolph.

                         the sergeant at arms will take the 
                         jury to an ante-room where you'll 
                         wait until further instruction.

               the sergeant at arms begins leading the jurors out of the 
               room.

                                     jessep
                         what the hell's going on?

               no one will say anything until the jurors are out of the 
               room.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing; to captain)
                         captain, what the hell's going on? i 
                         did my job. i'd do it again. now i'm 
                         getting on a plane and going back to 
                         my base.

                         m.p.'s, guard the prisoner.

               the m.p.'s are tentative. they've never heard a marine colonel 
               referred to as "the prisoner" before. they sure as hell have 
               never been asked to guard one.

                         marine!
                              (ross keeps going)
                         marine!!
                              (ross is doing his 
                              job.)
                         i'm being charged with a crime? i'm -- 
                         that's what's happening? this -- i'm --
                         this is funny, you know that, this 
                         is --

               and jessep lunges at kaffee, and kaffee would be dead but 
               for the three m.p.'s who've leapt in to restrain jessep.  
               sam and jo have come to their feet and stand behind kaffee.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing; to kaffee)
                         i'm gonna tear your eyes right outta 
                         your head and piss in your dead skull.  
                         you fucked with the wrong marine.

               ross is done reading jessep his rights.

                                     ross
                         colonel jessep, do you understand 
                         those rights as i have just read 
                         then to you?

                                     jessep
                         i saved lives. that boy was -- there 
                         was a weak link. i saved lives, you 
                         hear me?

               the courtroom is silent from jessep's outburst. jessep shakes 
               his head.

                                     jessep
                              (continuing)
                         you fuckin' people.
                              (beat)
                         you have no idea how to defend a 
                         nation.
                              (continuing; to kaffee)
                         all you did was weaken a country 
                         today, kaffee. that's all you did. 
                         you put people in danger. sweet 
                         dreams, son.

                                     kaffee
                         don't call me son.
                              (beat)
                         i'm a lawyer, and an officer of the 
                         united states navy. and you're under 
                         arrest you sonofabitch.

               kaffee stays on jessep a moment longer, then remembers --

                                     kaffee
                              (continuing)
                         the witness is excused.

               the m.p.'s start leading jessep out, and kaffee notices 
               dawson. and downey. and ross. who are watching a man in a 
               marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... kaffee 
               takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat 
               from his hands. he takes a deep breath as we

                                                          slow dissolve to:
