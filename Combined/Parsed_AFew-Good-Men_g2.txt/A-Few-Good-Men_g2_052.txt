                         internal medicine at a hospital which 
                         serves over 8000 men. in your 
                         professional opinion, was willy 
                         santiago poisoned?

               jo stands.

                                     jo
                         your honor, we re-new our objection 
                         to commander stone's testimony, and 
                         ask that it be stricken from the 
                         record. and we further ask that the 
                         court instruct the jury to lend no 
                         weight to this witness's testimony.

               kaffee and sam are dying, but they're trying to keep their 
               poker-faces. randolph's gonna try to be polite about this, 
               but he thought he made himself clear.

                         sir, the defense strenuously objects 
                         and requests a meeting in chambers 
                         so that his honor might have an 
                         opportunity to hear discussion before 
                         ruling on the objection.

                                     randolph
                         the objection of the defense has 
                         been heard and overruled.

                                     jo
                         exception.

                                     randolph
                         noted. the witness is an expert and 
                         the court will hear his opinion.

                         doctor, in your expert, professional 
                         opinion, was willy santiago poisoned?

                                     stone
                         yes.

                                     ross
                         thank you, sir, i have no more 
                         questions.

                                     randolph
                         commander, you may step down.

                                     ross
                         please the court, while we reserve 
                         the right to call rebuttal witnesses 
                         if the need arises, the government 
                         rests.

                                     randolph
                         we'll stand in recess until ten-
                         hundred hours this monday, the l9th 
                         at which time the defense will call 
                         it's first witness.

               randolph raps his gavel.

                                     sergeant at arms
                         ten hut.

               and the courtroom begins clearing out. kaffee, jo and sam 
               are packing up their various papers.

                                     sam
                         i strenuously object? is that how it 
                         works? objection. overruled. no, no, 
                         no, no, i strenuously object. oh, 
                         well if you strenuously object, let 
                         me take a moment to reconsider.

                                     jo
                         i got it on the record.

                                     sam
                         you also got it in the jury's head 
                         that we're afraid of the doctor. you 
                         object once so they can hear you say 
                         he's not a criminologist. you keep 
                         after it and it looks like this great 
                         cross we did was just a bunch of 
                         fancy lawyer tricks. it's the 
                         difference between paper law and 
                         trial --

                                     kaffee
                         sam --

                                     sam
                         christ, you even had the judge saying 
                         stone was an expert!

                                     kaffee
                         sam, she made a mistake. let's not 
                         relive it.

               there's an uncomfortable silence.

                                     sam
                         i'm gonna go call my wife. i'll meet 
                         you tonight.

               sam starts to leave. jo turns and says

                                     jo
                         why do you hate them so much?

               sam stops and turns around.

                                     sam
                         they beat up on a weakling, and that's 
                         all they did. the rest is just 
                         smokefilled coffee-house crap. they 
                         tortured and tormented a weaker kid. 
                         they didn't like him. and they killed 
                         him. and why? because he couldn't 
                         run very fast.

               a long silence. kaffee makes a decision.

                                     kaffee
                         alright. everybody take the night 
                         off.

                                     sam
                              (continuing)
                         i apologize, i, --

                                     kaffee
                         it's alright. we've been working 20 
                         hour days for three and a half weeks 
                         straight. take the night off. go see 
                         your wife, see your daughter. jo, do 
                         whatever it is you do when you're 
                         not here. what day is tomorrow?

                                     sam
                         saturday.

                                     kaffee
                         we'll start at ten.

               kaffee picks up his stuff and walks out.

               sam and jo stand there uncomfortably for a moment. jo begins 
               packing up her things.

                                     sam
                         why do you like them so much?

                                     jo
                              (pause)
                         'cause they stand on a wall.
                              (beat)
                         and they say "nothing's gonna hurt 
                         you tonight. not on my watch."

               despite their differences, sam likes this woman.

                                     sam
                         don't worry about the doctor. this 
                         trial starts monday.

                                                                    cut to:
