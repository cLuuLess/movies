               int. a marine barracks

               we hear two pairs of footsteps and then

                                                                    cut to:

               the barracks corridor

               where we see that the footsteps belong to dawson and downey, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. they stop 
               when they get to a certain door. the drum cadence is still 
               growing. dawson puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  he opens's the door and they walk into
