               ext. the airstrip at guantanamo bay - day

               the whole place, in stark contrast to the washington navy 
               yard, is ready to go to war. fighter jets line the tarmac. 
               ground crews re-fuel planes. hurried activity.

               a 36 seat airforce jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a 
               stair unit is brought up.

               howard, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the 
               passengers begin to got off. mostly marines, a few sailors, 
               a couple of civilians, and kaffee, jo and sam. kaffee and 
               sam are wearing their summer whites, jo is in khakis.

               kaffee and sam stare out at what they see: they're not in 
               kansas anymore.

               howard shouts over the noise from the planes.

                                     howard
                         lieutenants kaffee and weinberg?

                                     kaffee
                              (shouting)
                         yeah.

                         commander galloway.

                                     howard

                         escort you to the windward side of 
                         the base.

                                     jo
                         thank you.

                                     howard
                         i've got some camouflage jackets in 
                         the back of the jeep, sirs, i'll 
                         have to ask you both to put them on.

                                     kaffee
                         camouflage jackets?

                                     howard
                         regulations, sir. we'll be riding 
                         pretty close to the fenceline. the 
                         cubans see an officer wearing white, 
                         they think it's someone they might 
                         wanna take a shot at.

               kaffee turns and glares at sam.

                                     kaffee
                         good call, sam.

                                                                    cut to:
