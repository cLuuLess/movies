               int. kaffee's apt. - later - night

               the remnants of the chinese food is spread around. sam and 
               jo are sitting and taking notes from kaffee. as he speaks, 
               he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. he refers 
               to the blackboard.

                                     kaffee
                         this is our defense. intent: no one 
                         can prove there was poison on the 
                         raq. code red: they're common and 
                         accepted in guantanamo bay. the order:
                              (he writes)
                         a) kendrick gave it. b) they had no 
                         choice but to follow it.
                              (beat)
                         that's it.

                                     sam
                         what about motive?

                                     kaffee
                         we're a little weak on motive. they 
                         had one.

                                     jo
                         just because a person has a motive 
                         doesn't mean --

                                     kaffee
                         relax. we'll deal with the fenceline 
                         shooting when it comes up. for now 
                         we start here --
                              (pointing to intent)
                         i don't know what made santiago die, 
                         i don't want to know. i just want to 
                         be able to show it could've been 
                         something other than poison. jo, 
                         talk to doctors. find out everything 
                         there is to know about lactic 
                         acidosis. let's start prepping for 
                         stone.

                                     jo
                         as long as we're on the subject of 
                         the doctor --

                                     kaffee
                         here we go.

                                     jo
                         listen to me, three o'clock he doesn't 
                         know what killed santiago, then he 
                         meets with jessep, and at five o'clock 
                         he says it was poison? the doctor's 
                         covering up the truth.

                                     kaffee
                         oh, that's a relief. i was afraid i 
                         wouldn't be able to use the "liar, 
                         liar, pants on fire" defense. we 
                         can't prove coercion!! alright, 
                         fitness reports and biographical 
                         information.

                         cartons 3 and 4.

               kaffee looks at the cartons and the mind-numbing amount of 
               paper.

                                     kaffee
                         no cliff-notes on these things?

                                                               dissolve to:
