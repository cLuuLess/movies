ext. base of rock wall - day

blain joins ramirez, behind cover at the foot of the cliff. as they 
take cover, ramirez notices the wound on blain's shoulder.

ramirez
you're hit. you're bleedin', man.

blain looks briefly at the wound.

blain
(spits)
ain't got time to bleed.

on a signal, they both clear cover and fire long bursts from their 
weapons up the cliff.

the smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered by withering fire. 
they duck down as a grenade explodes nearby. ramirez quickly replaces 
the 40mm rounds into the six-shooter.

blain
son-of-a-bitch's dug in like a alabama tick... 
(spits)
... jack us around all day.

ramirez
hell, dude, we don't have all day.

ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire, blasting six rapid-
fire shots on a high-arc trajectory towards the rocks. blain reacts.

blain
shit, pancho!!!

blain dives against the protective cover of the rock wall, covering his 
head. ramirez casually hops across, squatting next to blain. they make 
eye-contact.

ramirez
what's your problem, dude?

before blain can answer, ramirez puts his fingers into his ears and 
grimaces just as... 

the entire hillside explodes, blowing the guerrillas into the air, a 
torrent of vegetation and earth raining down the cliff, obscuring blain 
and ramirez.
