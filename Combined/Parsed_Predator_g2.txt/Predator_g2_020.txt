int. helicopter - day

ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires, using his knife to 
check the edges of the seats and door frames. grimly he glances at the 
two bodies slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping into and 
rappelling down the rope to the ground.

he joins schaefer standing in the f.g. they look up, watching as dillon 
moves through the cockpit, searching through pockets and compartments. 
schaefer turns his back to the helicopter.

ramirez
the pilots have each got one round in the head. and whoever hit it 
stripped the shit out of it.

schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary. he turns back, 
looking at the chopper.

schaefer
took 'em out with a heat seeker.

ramirez 
there's something else, major... 

schaefer
mmmnnn...?

ramirez
i don't think that was any ordinary army taxi... 

schaefer looks at him quizzically.

ramirez
... looks more like a surveillance bird to me.

dillon rappels down the line and approaches.

dillon 
have you picked up their trail yet?

schaefer taps ramirez on the shoulder and he moves away. schaefer turns 
to dillon:

schaefer
billy's on it.
(indicates chopper)
heat seeker. pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.

dillon
they're getting better equipped every day.

bill approaches from the background.

billy
major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. looks like 
they took some prisoners from the chopper.
(points)
then a different set of track, over there.

schaefer
(puzzled)
what do you mean?

billy
six others, u.s. issue jungle boots. they came in from the north, then 
followed the guerrillas.

schaefer turns to dillon.

schaefer
mean anything to you?

dillon
probably another rebel patrol. they operate in here all the time.

schaefer is obviously concerned about this. he turns to billy.

schaefer
get ahead, see what you can find.
(to ramirez) 
slow and easy.
(to dillon)
we don't want any accidents.

billy takes up the trail, disappearing in to the jungle. ramirez 
signals, the team moves out.
