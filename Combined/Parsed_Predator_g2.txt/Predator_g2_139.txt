machete, also containing a coil of piano wire, green tape and medical 
supplies. he lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white 
light. schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf until the flame

schaefer - bow and arrow montage - night (later) 

holding a three foot section of fire-hardened sapling between his feet 
and shoulder, he scrapes the char from the seasoned wood with his 
machete.

he bends the bow and attaches a long piece of piano wire to one end, 
carefully wrapping it for strength, using strips of green tape to cover 
the sides of the wire where the nock of the arrow will fit.

he attaches split quilled feathers with fishing line to an arrow, its 
tip fashioned into a series of barbs, rubbing them to a polished 
hardness against a smooth stone. when finished he places the arrow on 
the ground next to three other identical arrows.
