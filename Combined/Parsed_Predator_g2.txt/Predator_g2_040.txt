ext. schaefer

crouched to the side of the truck, watches the camp, seeing below 
through the dense undergrowth, ramirez, barely visible, signaling.

before him are two fragmentation grenades. he looks at his watch, and 
then up the hill to:


dillon and hawkins

their weapons ready. dillon picks up his binoculars, focusing on the 
machine gun emplacement, seeing a man, his face covered by a hat. the 
head rises, revealing the face of blain, who looks above the camp and 
slightly nods. putting his glasses down, motions to hawkins.

dillon
(to hawkins)
ready, kid?

hawkins grins back. together they slip through the grass, downward 
towards the edge of the camp.
