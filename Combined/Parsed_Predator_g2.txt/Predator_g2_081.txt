ext. anna and hawkins - day

anna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on, breathing hard with 
the exertion.

hawkins, ten yards behind, closing the distance, taking advantage of 
any hesitation anna makes, struggling with the dense jungle.

anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through the trees. she sprints 
hard across the clear ground.
