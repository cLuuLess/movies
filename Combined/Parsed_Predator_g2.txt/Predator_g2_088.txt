blain and mac at either end, cautiously searching the jungle; billy 
covering their flanks.

schaefer and dillon approach anna. she seems unaware of their presence, 
staring numbly ahead. schaefer checks her out, looking for wounds, he 
wipes some of the blood from her face.

schaefer
it's not her blood.

ramirez emerges from the jungle carrying hawkins' mp-5 and radio. he 
approaches, dumping the equipment on the ground.

ramirez
major, you'd better take a look at this.

schaefer

ramirez
(oddly)
i can't tell.
