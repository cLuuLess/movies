ext. hunter's pov - day

peering out through the vines. dillon is looking directly at him. 
dillon turns, moves on, as the hunter resumes his stalk, timing his 
movements perfectly with those of dillon.


back to scene - dillon

as he approaches the rock outcropping. he signals. receiving no 
response he moves closer, turning cautiously to right and left.

dillon
(whispering)
mac... mac.

he moves closer to the rocks, eyes probing. through a gap in the rocks 
he sees mac's face, staring up at him, eyes frozen wide in death.

dillon spins hard. he stares at the solid wall of undergrowth. he looks 
from one side of the corridor to the other. something it out there. 
where?

something in the vines has caught his attention. he stares hard at a 
section of moss.
