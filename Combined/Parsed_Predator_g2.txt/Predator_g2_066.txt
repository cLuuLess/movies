ext. jungle valley - day

the twilight world of a prehistoric forest, filled with gigantic plants 
and towering trees, overgrown with vines and creepers.

the team, with billy at point, walk alongside a wandering stream bed, 
weirdly illuminated by shafts of light, streaming through openings in 
the trees, as if from spotlights, a hundred feet above.

it is midday, hot and humid, the air buzzing with the sounds of 
insects, the crying of birds and monkeys. the men are moving fast and 
quiet, straining to see into the dense jungle, aware of every sound, 
sweating, quietly slapping at biting insects.
