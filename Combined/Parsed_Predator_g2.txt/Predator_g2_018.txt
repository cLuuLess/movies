ext. jungle hillside - day

descending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters an even denser 
growth of jungle, at times moving by instinct, as they are often

some hand signals to ramirez, indicating a new direction. ramirez nods 
and moves on, schaefer signaling to the rest of the men.
