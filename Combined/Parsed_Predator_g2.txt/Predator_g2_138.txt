ext. the canyon - day (dusk) 

schaefer gasps as his eyes bolt open in fear. as if the hunter were 
still attacking, schaefer rolls to his feet and runs, slogging through 
the thick mud, stumbling, lunging forward, gasping for breath.

schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow pool, scuttling, 
crab-like into the chest deep water. schaefer backs into the moss-
covered wall by the waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his 
senses.

as the water settles, he looks down, seeing the image of himself, 
reflected in the pool; his hair and face covered in thick clay. he 
stares, mesmerized at the image.

he lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the mud from his 
face, exposing a patch of skin. he studies the mud in his hand and then 
looks at the image of himself in the water, seeing the exposed skin. he 
stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through his mind. he places 
the mud back on his face, again looking at his image.

schaefer
you couldn't see me.

he looks up, out into the failing light, at the treeline of the 
deepening forest, realizing that fate has given him a fighting chance. 
slowly a look of vengeance and hatred crosses over his face.
