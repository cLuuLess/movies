ext. schaefer - day

belly crawls silently through the tall grass just outside and above the 
main entrance to the camp. he stops, studying the ancient, rusted 
skeleton of a truck parked on a level spot above the camp, ist engine 
quietly idling. the truck is jacked and blocked up, one rear wheel 
attached to a belt-drive leading to a pump, drawing water from a river 
nearby. in the open cab of the truck a guard is on duty, watching the 
high ground above the camp.

schaefer moves out, heading for the guard.
