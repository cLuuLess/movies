there is no sign of schaefer. precious seconds pass. slowly, looking 
like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking a feeble breath. he is nearly 
finished, his energy sapped. but the water is calm and a few strokes 
are enough to carry him near the shore. his feet hit bottom.

he tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick mud slurry at 
the river bank. with his last ounce of strength, he crawls, panting and 
gasping into a sheltered mud overhang, collapsing beside the exposed 
root-system of a dead tree, his body completely covered in thick, gray 
mud.

nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the opposite side 
of the river, scanning the bank. there is no sign of the hunter. he 
collapses in relief. he's escaped.

suddenly, the hunter impacts the water, throwing up a huge splash. he 
stands up in the waist deep water. as the water streams off of his 
body, the chameleon effect rapidly changes, struggling to match the 
shifting color patterns of the shimmering water.

his glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where schaefer lies 
helplessly trapped.

the hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on this prey.


schaefer

is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes locked on to the 
incredible creature that is about to kill him.
