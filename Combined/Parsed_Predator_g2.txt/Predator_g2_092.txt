ext. mac - day

has heard blain's cry. he moves fast through the brush. he hears a 
rustling in the bushes. a wet sucking sound. mac charges into the 
clearing. in the instant before the hunter disappears into the forest, 
mac sees a vision so brief and fantastic that it seems like a 
hallucination.

the hunter's eyes flare momentarily from the green before they vanish.

mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest open, the powerful 
man, dead.

(shouting)
contact, 30 right!!!

he opens fire with his m-203, belted shells slamming into the weapon 
from the magazine at his waist, expending it in one long burst.
