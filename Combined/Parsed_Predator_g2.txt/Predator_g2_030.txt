ext. jungle hillside - day

mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the undergrowth, pausing 
cautiously, his senses alert, intense, almost nervous. he moves on, his 
huge body barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy 
undergrowth.

dillon appears. as he moves on, he crosses over a fallen tree. stepping 
down, his foot breaks through a rotten portion, a chuck of the log 
breaking free and rolling down the hill.

dillon at once goes into a defensive position, listening. the jungle is 
silent. he stands and starts to move forward. suddenly mac appears 
within inches of dillon's face. mac's face is menacing, angry.

mac
(hissing; barely audible)
you're ghostin' on me, motherfokaaa!... i don't care who you are back 
in the world... you give away our position again and i'll bleed you 
quiet and leave your fuckin' ass right here.
(hisses; spits)
got it?

dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in cold hatred at mac, 
controlling his rage... he knows the rules.

not waiting for a response, mac turns and vanished into the jungle. 
seething with anger dillon focuses on a still moving leaf and stem, 
indicating mac's exit point. he moves on.
