ext. hunter's pov - jungle - night

emerging from his camp, the hunter swings into the nearby tree line, 
moving to the uppermost branches. the hunter travels silently from tree 
to tree, arriving at the canyon rim where far below he sees in the 
canyon, the bonfire, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored collage of heat 
waves and flares, luring him onward.


schaefer

hidden back within the deep notch of several large logs and broken 
trees, in the river canyon. below him, on the rock plateau, is the 
bonfire, illuminating in shifting patterns of light, the awaiting arena 
of destiny.

his eyes shift, trance-like, moving from side to side, watching the 
approaches to the fire below. his senses are alert; his nerves on a 
wire edge.
