int. schaefer - night 

creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front of the other, 
suddenly stops, hearing the click-scrape, click-scrape, now on his 
right.

starting to move in this new direction, he stops again, hearing the 
sound now directly across from him. listening, he hears the sound again 
from yet another direction, the sound echoing in the natural 
amphitheater of rock.

schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits. suddenly he crouches and 
freezes, hearing the unbelievable sound of a human voice, softly 
echoing through the amphitheater.

anna's voice (o.s.)
(filtered; in spanish)
look out, behind you!!!

schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of anna's voice. wide-
eyed, straining, he waits, hearing only the muted flowing of water, the 
hissing and popping of the dying fire above, the shadows growing 
longer, darker with each minute.

and then again, anna's voice.

anna's voice (o.s.)
(in spanish)
... look out, behind you!

schaefer
(to himself)
anna...?

trance-like he moves towards the sound.


the hunter

his head canted, throat distended, utters another mimicry.


schaefer

moving towards the space between two boulders from which the voice 
seems to emanate.

schaefer
(louder)
anna...?


the hunter

his ears now directed towards the sound of schaefer's voice, his slowly 
approaching footsteps, raises his weapon.


schaefer

pauses before the opening of the passageway. all is silent. he 
hesitates to enter. listening. he starts to move and then hears a new 
voice:

hunter (o.s.)
(mac's voice)
dillon, over here... 

schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's voice, backs quickly 
into the space between a boulder and the high rock wall of the 
amphitheater.
