ext. arrow - night

flies into the night, lodging into a branch of an exposed tree, just 
missing the hunter's head.

in a blur, the hunter's arm streaks downward, a dull flash of light 
leaving his fingers as he fires the weapon, the projectile streaking 
downward, exploding into the log, inches from schaefer, sending a 
shower of wood chips and bark, flying in every direction.


schaefer

in a flash, is up and running, clutching his weapons, leaping from 
boulder to boulder. he jumps down into the lighted area below, landing 
hard, rolling into the protective shadows of the rocks, putting the 
loping fire between he and the hunter's position on the rocks above.

he moves forward, darting to look backwards before leaping off the lip 
of the table rock into the boulder field below, a flat plane littered 
by weirdly shaped, water-erroded rocks, forming a giant stone 
ampitheater. shadows leap and dance across the boulders, cast by the 
bonfire from the plateau above.

schaefer crouches between two large boulders, quietly breathing through 
clenched teeth, feeling the pain of his now freely bleeding shoulder 
wound.
