ext. observer's altered pov - day

looking down from his vantage point to the treeline below, terraces 
like stepping stones, focusing on a tree, fifty feet away.

the observer utters a low trill and springs outward into space, 
hurtling downward towards his landing point, the canopy of the trees 
approaching in a staccato rush of green.

the sounds of the forest are again altered and enhanced with an 
electric, static-like quality as the observer descends fluidly through 
the trees and to the ground.

he enters the camp, surveying the terrible destruction and carnage. he 
sees the dead guerrillas, the dissipating heat from their bodies 
leaving them pale and ghost-like, as if fading light about to 
extinguish. he sees their weapons, the cold hard steel of the barrels 
registering ice blue in his vision.
