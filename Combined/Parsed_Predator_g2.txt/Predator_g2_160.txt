ext. schaefer - night

bow drawn, trapped against the rock, hearing the sound of the hunter 
approaching from the left, now the right, is helpless, not knowing 
where to fire, the hunter's deadly strike only an instant away.

still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he carefully releases the 
draw on the string, reaching to his neck for the flash-grenade. with 
painstaking care he removes the grenade from his neck.

focusing on the rocks before him and the still approaching sound, he 
reaches down with the grenade, gripping with his fingertips the 
matchhead fuse, placing it against the rocks at his side.

with a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws the grenade, 
snatching up the bang-stick with his good hand.

the matchhead sputters as the grenade flies through the air, an instant 
later a blinding, white flash of light illuminates the amphitheater... 

in that instant schaefer sees above him and to his left, the hunter, 
poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised, about to strike! 
momentarily blinded by the flash of light, the hunter's head recoils to 
the side.

darkness swallows the image of the hunter, but in that second, schaefer 
seizes his advantage, hurling the bang-stick spear.
