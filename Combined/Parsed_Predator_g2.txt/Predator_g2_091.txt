ext. blain - day

crouched in the undergrowth. there is a movement in the brush before 
him. he wipes the sweat from his eyes and clicks his safety on the 
mini-gun to fire.

the sound is growing closer. blain levels the weapon. a smile crosses 
his face.

blain
(whispers)
come on in you fuckers... come on in. ol' painless' is waitin'... 

the movement in the brush is growing louder. blain's finger moves 
closer to the trigger.

suddenly a small tapir bursts through the leaves, startling blain. he 
relaxes momentarily as he watches the animal scurrying from sight. he 
stands... 

something grazes his shoulder, a gout of blood erupting. he starts to 
turn, the mini-gun held low, ready to fire... 

... from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the hunter's weapon streaks 
toward him like a missile. he screams as it enters his back, erupting 
from his chest in an explosion of blood.
