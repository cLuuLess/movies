ext. hunter - night

continues on, moving silently down through the canyon.


schaefer

sits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage amid the 
darkness of the logs.

suddenly, over the crackling of the fire, the buzzing, clicking of 
insects, and the croaking of frogs, suddenly ceases.

slowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his wounded shoulder 
trembling, the blood beginning to seep through the bandage.

the bow straining at full draw, schaefer stares intently, 
concentrating, searching for the hunter's form in the dancing light 
below.
