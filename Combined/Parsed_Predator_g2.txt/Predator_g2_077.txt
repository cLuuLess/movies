ext. anna and ramirez - day

sensing the danger has passed, ramirez releases his grip on anna. as 
they start to rise, ramirez sheaths his knife and unslings his mp-5. 
anna still stares hard into the jungle.

suddenly, without even looking, anna with the trained reflexes of an 
experienced fighter swings the burl with all her might, catching 
ramirez hard on the side of the head, just above the eye, opening a 
wicked gash. spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin. as 
ramirez goes down, doubled over in pain, anna turns, scrambling up the 
embankment, running for the jungle.

ramirez cries out.
