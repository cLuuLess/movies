int. table top boulder - night 

next to the flowing stream, surrounded by an open area of rock.

schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and ochre camouflage 
partially washed away, climbs up a log onto the boulder. oblivious to 
the searing pain in his shoulder, he breathes in hot, powerful 
exchanges, his eyes wide and glowing with vengeance.

schaefer
bleed, you bastard.

his bow down, schaefer follows the blood trail across the rock, edging 
alongside a huge vertical boulder. the blood trail stops.

he takes another step forward, past a darkened alcove... 

schaefer spins, seeing in the alcove the surprised hunter whirl and 
spring towards him... 

schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely kicking the hunter's 
arm. the weapon flies from the hunter's hand clattering to the rock.

before he can recover, schaefer follows with a karate kick to the 
chest, hurling the hunter to the ground, his back exposed.

in a flash, schaefer is standing over the hunter, the bow drawn, 
poised, the blood from his open wound dripping onto the hunter's back.

the hunter slowly rolls onto his back, revealing his face, his eyes 
bleached white in shock from the loss of blood. the hunter's body, 
rippled out of control, trying desperately to orientate itself to the 
environment.

schaefer
(incredulous)
who the hell are you...?
