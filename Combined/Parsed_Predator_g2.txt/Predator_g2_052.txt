ext. palapa - water area - day

ramirez, blain and billy race down the back stairs of the palapa, 
firing mini-gun, automatic and grenade rounds at the escaping 
guerrillas as they flee the area, splashing, charging across the 
shallow river.

the guerrillas are history... in no uncertain terms.
