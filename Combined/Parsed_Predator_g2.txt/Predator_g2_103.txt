ext. mac - night (later)

hunched down in a foxhole, the mini-gun on a tripod before him. it's 
nearly a full moon, the jungle a montage of shadows and reflections. 
mac stares into the night, his eyes always moving.

mac
(distant; whispering)
it's the same kinda jungle, bro, same moon... everything...
(pause)
... areal number ten night. remember bro? only you and me, the only 
one's out of the whole fuckin' platoon who made it out.

his eyes probe the darkness, remembering.

mac
... we walked out on top of 'em. not a scratch, not a fuckin' scratch.
(spits into the night)
no fuckin' chili-choker got to you, bro... you were just too good... 

he ponders this a moment.

mac
... i promise you this, bro... however he is, i hope he's plannin' to 
hit us again...
(pauses; spits)
... 'cause he's got my name on 'em.
