ext. encampment - dusk 

the team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of trees, a solid 
wall to their backs. the men are barely visible they blend in so well.

nearby, mac is stringing a trip wire, low to the ground, covering it 
with leaves and grass. he moves into camp and reports to schaefer.

mac
we've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. 
nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.

schaefer
thank you, sergeant.

mac starts to go but schaefer places his hand on his shoulder.

schaefer
i'm sorry, bull. it's never easy. he was a good soldier.

mac
(hardened)
the best friend i ever had.

mac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside a dark object on 
the ground. he kneels beside the poncho pulling back the zipper 
revealing blain's face, looking peaceful in death, as if lying in 
state.

mac removes something from his pocket, holding it in his hand, studying 
it.


detail of object in mac's hand

the small whiskey flash, the chrome rubbed away in places revealing the 
brass beneath and a medallion depicting the 101 1st airborne division.


mac

takes a tiny sip from the flask. he replaces the cap and lifts the flap 
of blain's shirt pocket, placing the flask inside. he lingers on the 
face and then closes the zipper.

mac
(softly)
good-bye, bro.


anna

is huddles into a foxhole, her hands still tied in front of her. she 
looks down at her pants leg. the hunter's bloodstain glows with a faint 
luminosity. she places her fingers near the stain.
