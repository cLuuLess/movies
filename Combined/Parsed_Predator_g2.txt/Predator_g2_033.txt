ext. blain and mac - day

crawl silently through the underbrush. with nearly imperceptible 
movements, blain slips out of the cartridge pack, ditching the mini-
gun. he withdraws his combat knife, placing it between his teeth.

they move through the underbrush in tandem, like two bug cats, 
stalking. mac freezes, the sweat pouring from his face, holds up his 
hand as blain stops.

using a blade of grass, mac points out a metal trip wire, following it 
to a hidden claymore mine. blain grins making a switching gesture. 
carefully mac detaches the lead wires. directing the mine towards the 
camp, he reattaches the wires, nodding at blain.
