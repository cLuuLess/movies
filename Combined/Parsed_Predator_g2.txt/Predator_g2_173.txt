ext. hunter's camp - day

the multi harmonic whine of the hunter's ship is still building as the 
ground begins to shake.

schaefer, realizing that the ship is going to explode, and ignoring the 
pain of his shoulder and leg, runs desperately, searching for cover. he 
sprints for the edge of the clearing, diving over the embankment just 
as:

a blinding purple flash blows the ship to pieces.
