ext. two assault helicopters - night

burst over the top of a ridge. rising up in silhouette they perform a 
radical left bank turn and descend rapidly into an adjoining valley, 
racing over the jungle at treetop level.

as the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed maneuvers through the 
winding canyon, the pilot's voices can be heard, coordinating their 
operations.

pilot one (v.o.)
redbird two, two. bearing south, three, five, zero, one o'clock on the 
saddle ridge. over.

pilot two (v.o.)
roger, blue leader. three, five, zero, on your move. over.

the helicopters rise in perfect coordination over another ridge and 
bank sharply into the next valley, leveling out as they go.
