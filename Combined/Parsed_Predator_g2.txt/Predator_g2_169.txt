ext. glen - pre-dawn

schaefer follows the blood trail, deeper into the incredibly dense 
vegetation, ripping aside the heavy growth, plunging onward.

before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge spider web, 
intricate, four feet across. schaefer starts to sweep aside the web. 
with a sharp intake of breath, he halts, inches from the wed. something 
is wrong.

examining the web closer he sees not silken threads but a hard and 
shiny network of hair-fine wire: a trap.

he backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground. he swings the 
branch with a mighty heave, clenching his teeth in pain. the branch 
sails end over end into the web impacting the strands. a metallic snap 
is heard; a high-pitches whine and the log is violently severed, the 
pieces flying in opposite directions with great speed.

schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of the fleeing 
hunter.
