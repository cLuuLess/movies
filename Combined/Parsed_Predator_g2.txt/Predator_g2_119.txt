ext. the hunter - day 

in an indiscernible blue of camouflage releases his weapon.


dillon

screams, his arm instantly severed halfway between his shoulder and 
elbow. the weapon drops to the ground, the forearm still attached, 
still firing.

with his left hand he fires the second weapon shouting insanely as 
swings it towards the blurred image of his unseen attacker, hitting 
nothing.

the hunter reloads his weapon which turns invisible again. dillon 
continues to fire. the hunter's weapon appears from below, cutting into 
dillon's unprotected abdomen, which, as if hit by a samurai sword, 
bursts open. dillon cries out as the huge man hits the ground.
