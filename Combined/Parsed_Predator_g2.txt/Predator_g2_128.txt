ext. hunter's pov - day

as he nears the edge of the precipice from which schaefer has fallen. 
the hunter in close pursuit does not hesitate but launches himself off 
the cliff in a spectacular leap, streaking downward towards the tops of 
the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.

the hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree, the branches and 
leaves rushing past in a kaleidoscopic blur.

the hunter bounds off of one branch after another, moving through the 
trees as an expert skier might negotiate a series of downhill gates.

the hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty feet of open 
space to a large branch of a huge tree, affording a good view of the 
river below. from his vantage point, looking down at the windening, 
slowing expanse of river, schaefer is nowhere to be seen.
