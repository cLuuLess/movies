ext. helicopter - day 

the door gunner swings the m-60 into firing position, pointing it at 
schaefer. he racks the bolt, loading a round.

the crewmen look tense, frightened.

anna, standing next to the door gunner, stares at the strange creature 
before her, narrowing her eyes, uncertain. is there something familiar 
about the figure?


schaefer

stands in the clearing, staring at the helicopter and the array of 
weapons pointed at him. he looks dazed, like a man making contact with 
members of an alien race, for the first time.


the helicopter

hovers low to the ground, the tension inside building as schaefer 
approaches.

more weapons swing into position. fingers tighten on triggers. suddenly 
anna recognizes the figure. realizing the danger she holds up her 
hands, shouting

anna
noooooo!!!!!!
