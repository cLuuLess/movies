int. command post - day (magic hour)

where a man wearing a military uniform watches through the large open 
windows the helicopter as it continues to approach. before the skids 
have even touched down he sees the first of the men, dressed in 
civilian clothes but carrying full combat gear, alight gracefully from 
the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side, the orders 
shouted by one man lost in the roar of the chopper.

the man turns away from the window, to a figure, hidden in the shadows.

man
he's here.

he turns back, lowering a bamboo shade, obscuring the window.
