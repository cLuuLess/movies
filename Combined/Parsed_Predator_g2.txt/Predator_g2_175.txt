ext. hunter's camp - day

the jungle has been completely transformed. no longer lush and verdant, 
the area is clear-cut, two feet above the ground, covered in fine 
white, smoldering ash. amongst the shattered stumps, debris from the 
ship, bright as magnesium flares, burns with exotic colors.

if the foreground, schaefer, a living dead-man, streaked with the alien 
ash, rises up from a shallow depression, staring dumbstruck at the 
site.

breaking in low over the treetops, the helicopters flare up into 
position, one preparing to land.

as the chopper descends, the crew, standing in the door way, stare 
transfixed at the devastation, their eyes trying to penetrate the dense 
white smoke.

as the helicopter slowly descends, its propwash creating a raging 
storm, schaefer materializes from the swirling smoke and ash, his 
features taking form as he approaches, his naked body covered in mud, 
blood and ash.
