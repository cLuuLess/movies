ext. hunter's pov - day

moving through the jungle. as he steps clear of the foliage he sees 
anna driving hard into the alleyway, running directly towards him. 
twenty yards away, hawkins, closes in.


back to scene - hawkins

only a few feet behind anna, lunges forward, knocking her to the 
ground. in a second he's on her, his weapon ready. she struggles to her 
feet, fighting, gasping for breath. hawkins holds the mp-5 on her, 
looking at her, almost pleading. he doesn't want to shoot her, but he 
will if he has to.

hawkins
please... 

she looks at the weapon, to hawkins and then, hopefully, to the jungle. 
she stops, staring hard down the alleyway. something... suddenly she 
sees it!

anna
(in spanish)
look out, behind you!!!

hawkins spins...
