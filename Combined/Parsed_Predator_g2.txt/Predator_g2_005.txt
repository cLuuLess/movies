int. palapa - day

large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof. behind a 
partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked lightbulb hung from the 
rafters illuminates a bank of compact field radio equipment, maps and 
aerial photographs. otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in 
stark contrast to this high-tech invasion.

philips and schaefer enter the room.

philips
(growing serious)
we've got a real problem here, something right up your alley.

they cross to the center of the room to a folding table, covered with a 
large topographical map of the central american highland jungle. 
philips leans over the table, circling a set of coordinates and a mark 
on the open map.

philips
eighteen hours ago i was informed that one of our choppers, 
transporting three presidential cabinet members from this charming 
little country, was shot down... 
(point to the circled area)
... the pilots radioed from the ground that they were all alive. their 
position was fixed by the transponder beacon onboard the chopper.
(points)
here.

schaefer studies the map. he looks up at philips.

schaefer
that's over the border, general.

philips
(dead serious)
that's the problem. apparently they strayed off course.
(pause)
we're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.

schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.

schaefer
(quietly)
what have you got in mind, general.

philips
we figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. 
after that, there's not much hope. we want a rescue operation mounted 
tonight. that doesn't give you much time.

another puff on the cigar.

schaefer 
what else it new? when do we leave?

philips looks at his watch.

philips
you lift off in three hours.
(pause)
there's one other thing.

schaefer
what's that, general?

philips
someone else will be going in with you.

schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.

schaefer
you know we don't work with outsiders, general.

voice (o.s.)
who said anything about outsiders, dutch?

schaefer turns, seeing the outline of a figure standing in the doorway 
of the communications room, holding a sheaf of papers.

wearing pressed fatigues, dillon, mid-thirties, black, walks into the 
room.

although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing and grooming 
indicate he's been away from the business of soldiering for sometime. 
his quick intelligent eyes reveal his current profession.

dillon
last time we danced, it was lieutenant, schaefer.

a grin breaks out across schaefer's face.

schaefer
dillon, you son of a bitch.

the two men step forward and simultaneous swing from the hip as it to 
land a punch... but their hands slap together in a gesture of 
friendship, their forearms bulging, testing each other's strength.

dillon
(warmly)
how you been, dutch?

they continue the contest, schaefer has the edge, forcing dillon's arm 
slowly downward.

schaefer
you've been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?

dillon
(grinning)
no way, old buddy.

schaefer
you never did know when to quit.

they look into each other's faces, each remembering something from the 
past. a moment's hesitation and they quit the contest. they laugh, 
dillon slapping schaefer on the shoulder.

dillon
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week 
was really something. blew the entry points on three floors and 
neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. beautiful.

schaefer
like the old days, dillon.

dillon
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya.

schaefer looks at dillon, quietly considering him.

schaefer
wasn't my style. we're a rescue unit, not assassins.
(smiles)
this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back 
to the bush. what's so important?

dillon 
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in 
this part of the world. they're about to get squeezed. we can't let 
that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and 
quiet... no screw-ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few 
strings at the state department... and here we are.

schaefer
go on.

dillon goes to the map.

dillon
the set-up is simple, dutch. one day job. we pick up their trail at the 
chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the 
border before anyone knows we were there. you've done it a hundred 
times. nothing out of the ordinary.

schaefer considers this.

schaefer
and nothing we can't handle alone.

philips breaks in.

philips 
i'm afraid those are your orders, major. once you reach your objective, 
dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge.

schaefer looks from philips to dillon. he still doesn't like it.

dillon
not to worry, dutch. i haven't lost my edge. they've got a head start 
on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece 
of cake.

philips
gentlemen, we're losing time.
(to schaefer)
you'd better get your men ready.
(pause)
good luck, major.
