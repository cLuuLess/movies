ext. guerrilla camp - day

a man almost completely on fire is hit by an onslaught of gunfire, 
ripping him back into the jungle.

ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the six-shooter... seconds later the 
machine gun implacement erupts in a series of explosions, blowing two 
guerrillas into the air.

at the hillside hut, two guerrillas move into position by the window, 
drawing down on schaefer as he appears, racing down the hill.

as they are about to open fire, dillon appears, yelling out a warning.

dillon
on your nine!!!

schaefer dives, hitting the ground as dillon opens fire taking out the 
guerrillas. schaefer rolls to his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade 
launcher, completely destroying the hut.
