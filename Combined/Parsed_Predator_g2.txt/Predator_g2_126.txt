ext. canyon wall - day

in a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, schaefer crashes through 
the trees at the canyon's edge, free falling into space.

with a sickening impact, he hits the branches of the first trees lining 
the canyon and falls, a hundred feet, through one canopy after another, 
desperately grabbing for limbs and branched to break his fall.

he hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees, impacting 
crosschest on a large branch, knocking his wind out.

semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides off, fingers 
digging into the bark, falling another ten feet into the swiftly moving 
river.
