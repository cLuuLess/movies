kneels at the side of the original trail examining the ground. he 
rises, holding a spent cartridge. schaefer approaches, kneeling beside 
him.

schaefer
what happened here, billy?

billy looks at him, puzzled.

billy
strange, major. there was a firefight. shooting in all directions.

schaefer
i can't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush.

billy
i don't believe he did, sir. i couldn't find a single track. just

schaefer
what about the rest of hopper's men?

billy shakes his head.

billy
(uncomfortably)
no sign. they never left here major.
(pause)
it's like they just disappeared.

schaefer ponders a moment. then, to billy:

schaefer
