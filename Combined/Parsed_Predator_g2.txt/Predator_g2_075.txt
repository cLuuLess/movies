ext. hunter's pov - day

still closing in on billy. billy turns back, looking high into the 
trees, puzzled and frightened. he's lost sense of the hunter's 
presence. he lowers his vision, looking towards the hunter, now on the 
ground, 30 yards across the clearing from billy. the hunter pauses.


back to scene - billy and schaefer

billy
(whispers)
can you see anything... 
(points)
... there?

schaefer stares hard at the jungle.

schaefer
it's... nothing...
