int. palapa - day

for the first time, schaefer studies the interior of the cavernous 
palapa, seeing the enormous stockpile of weapons, equipment and 
supplies stacked along the walls, obviously a major military stronghold 
hidden deep within the mountains. mac hustles up to schaefer, a look of 
urgency on his face.

schaefer
any sign of the hostages?

mac
(nods)
we found 'em both, dead. and the gear from the chopper. if they're 
central american, i'm a fuckin' chinaman. by the looks of 'em, i'd say 
our cabinet minister and his aide are cia.
(pause)
another thing, major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed 
are russians, military advisors by the look of it. something big was 
about to happen here.

schaefer looks at mac a moment, a flush of anger beginning to show.

schaefer
good work, mac. clear the area, no traces. get the men ready to move.

schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the unconscious 
guerrilla, racking a round into the chamber, reloading his weapon.

he kneels, staring into the face of a woman, anna, dark, late twenties. 
despite her blood and dirt-smeared face, she is beautiful.

schaefer
(closes eyes)
shit... 

he checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick up her pistol, 
ejecting the clip. he stands, beginning to shuffle through the papers 
scattered about the room. staring at one he looks up, the pieces 
falling together.
