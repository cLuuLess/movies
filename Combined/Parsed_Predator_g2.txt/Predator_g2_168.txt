ext. hunter's pov - camp - pre-dawn

staggering into the clearing, bleeding severely. the hunter is rapidly 
losing his camouflage ability, his skin turning a pale green, flexing 
and pulsing in shock. the glow of light from the energy field 
reflecting off the spreading apron of blood flowing from his wound.

with trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks it, pulling the 
shaft from his neck. he screams in pain.
