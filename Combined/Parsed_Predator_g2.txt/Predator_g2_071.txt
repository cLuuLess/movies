as billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one side by the towering 
trees, carpeting the mountainside. high above in the thick, 
impenetrable treeline, brightly colored birds squawk loudly, chasing

in position. an eerie silence, like a slowly falling curtain, descends 
over the jungle until even the buzzing and clicking of insects have 
ceased.
