ext. blain - day

crouches under heavy foliage, waiting. he is joined by mac. they glance 
briefly at each other, scanning in opposite directions for movement and 
sounds. they speak in whispers.

blain
say, bull. what's goin' down? we got movement?

mac
no. shithead with his trenchcoat and dee-coda-da ring was makin' enough 
noise to get us all waxed. i don't like that guy. don't like him at my 
back. i ain't winding up like those bastards back there.

mac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from his brow with his 
finger.

blain pats the mini-gun affectionately.

blain
i know what you mean, bull, but don't sweat it, me and 'ol 'painless' 
here are watchin' the front door.

mac
as always, bro... 

they do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at each other. two men who 
have seen it all, through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived to 
tell about it.

mac advances a few meters and signals slowly.
