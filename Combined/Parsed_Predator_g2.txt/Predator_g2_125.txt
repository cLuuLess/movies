ext. hunter's pov of schaefer - day

closing rapidly... another few yard.


back to scene - schaefer

runs like a madman, the sound of the hunter's footsteps close behind. 
he's losing ground. he knows he's going to die.

schaefer shouts. suddenly the ground before him collapses and he 
disappears from sight.
