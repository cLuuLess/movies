ext. jungle clearing - day

blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly with his mp-5. 
he steps back and turns, checking, revealing in the background the 
wreckage of a u.s. army uh-1h helicopter, hanging upside down, twenty 
feet above the ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly 
damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away.

a grappling hook is hurled from the ground, clattering into the cargo 
hold, hooking the edge of the airframe.
