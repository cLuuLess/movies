ext. anna - day

spins, hurling a string of insults to dillon in spanish.

anna
(in spanish)
you touch me again, pig, and i will cut off your balls!

dillon
(in spanish)
it's a long walk back, make it easy on yourself.

she spits at him, turning forward with a twist of her head.

dillon picks up his back, shouldering it. as they move on, mac calls 
out to him.

mac
(quietly)
hey, dillon, over here.

dillon doesn't respond.

mac
(louder)
dillon, over here.

dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding the girl.

dillon
yeah, what is it, sergeant?

mac unsheathes his knife. he gives dillon a cold look and turns him by 
the shoulders. crawling across the pack on dillon's back is a huge 
scorpion.

mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his blade, holding it before 
the wincing dillon. anna smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging 
insect.

anna
(in spanish)
when my people catch you, you'll wish you were him.

dillon looks at mac.

dillon
thanks.

mac
(coolly)
anytime.

mac flings the scorpion to the ground, crushing it with his boot. he 
looks up at dillon, walks away. dillon follows, pulling anna behind 
him.

billy, guarding the rear, glances furtively around the clearing. he 
moves a step forward and stops, freezing.

slowly he turns back, his eyes riveted upon the treeline above the 
camp. his eyes strain, his senses registering a fear he cannot name or 
see.

something is out there, in the trees, waiting, watching.

billy turns and walks into the jungle, pausing one last time to look 
behind him before he too disappears from sight.

the jungle grows silent.
