ext. helicopter pad - night

on adjoining pads, two other helicopters are visible; in the b.g. can 
be seen several concrete and thatchwork buildings, a secret command 
post disguised as a coastal fishing village.

the post in a flurry of activity, american advisors shouting directions 
to dozens of latin american soldiers who stand by to assist the landing 
helicopter and to load equipment into the other choppers.

inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against the 
bulkhead, as if asleep. he stirs, sits up, lighting up a cigar. with 
fatigue showing in his motion, he leans forward, descending to the 
ground. 

a jeep pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the front seat, 
tossing his gear into the rear. with a lurch the jeep heads out towards 
the command post. 

in the doorway two men solemnly watch as the jeep approaches. reaching 
the command post the man alights from the jeep, heading towards the two 
men.

into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps major 
alan schaefer, the team leader, 38, an intelligent and intense man. he 
informally salutes, general h.l. philips, 55, hardened, close-cropped 
graying hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of 
an elite commando unit in the u.s. army. he clasps schaefer warmly on 
the shoulder.

philips
(with affection)
you're looking well, dutch.

schaefer
it's been a long time, general.

they walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving the other man on 
guard.
