ext. river bed - day

the team moves cautiously through the winding stream bed, now wearing 
their clothing in various stages of disarray for comfort, sweat 
dripping from their bodies.

billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank, his 
concentration rapt, aboriginal. his face a trance-like mask of 
expectation.

blain, cradling the heavy mini-gun as if it were a toy, swings the 
weapon relentlessly across his field of view. he pauses to adjust the 
hanging, belted loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack 
magazine. an insect lands on his face and is trapped in the grease 
paint near his lips. he draws the hapless bug into his mouth with his 
tongue and quietly spits it out, his concentration unbroken.

mac follows, holding the m-60 high across his chest.

schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the dry leaves on the 
ground, heel to toe and on foot edges. he glances around, checking the 
team's position and progress.

hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply, exhausted, the radio 
a 60 pound demon.

anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream bank, slips on some 
loose dirt. unable to assist herself with her hands tied, she nearly 
falls. dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to her feet. she 
scrambles up the bank, dillon following.
