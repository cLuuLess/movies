ext. hunter's pov of schaefer - night

schaefer's body, looms over him, mottled and streaked from his exposed 
skin, blood oozing from the shoulder wound, his eyes like black sockets 
in his almost skull-like face. seen from this perspective, schaefer is 
a frightening, horrible visage.


the hunter

shudders, gasping hungrily for air, struggling to speak. from his 
throat, schaefer hears the feeble, distorted efforts of the hunter, at 
first garbled, incomprehensible and then, slowly, chillingly, taking on 
the timbre and quality of his own voice.

who...

... the hell... 
(nearly perfect)
... are... 
(perfect)
... you?

the hunter's strength seems to fade even more... 

then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing strength, he lashes 
out with one arm, activating the lethal, razor sharp spurs on his 
wrists.

the hunter's coiled leg kicks upward with incredible force, his 
terrible spur ripping into schaefer's thigh, hurling schaefer into the 
air, flipping him over, sending him crashing to his back into the 
shallow pool of water, momentarily losing his bow. he flounders 
desperately in the water, searching for the bow. he finds it just as... 

the hunter rises slowly to his feet, gasping desperately for breath. he 
inhales deeply, hungrily, gaining strength with each breath.

schaefer looks from the pool to see the hunter, raising his weapon to 
throw.

in one totally instinctual movement, schaefer draws back on the arrow 
to its very tip and fires.

the arrow, with a deadly thud, penetrates deeply into the hunter's 
neck. another bloodcurdling scream of rage as the hunter clutches his 
throat, dropping his weapon. an instant later and the hunter is gone.
