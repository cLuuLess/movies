int. palapa - day

the sniper crashes through the roof, landing on the floor near hawkins 
and ramirez who do a quick double take before opening fire on a group 
of fleeing guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others.

schaefer and dillon appear at the top of the staircase, schaefer 
freezing as he sees below a guerrilla raising an ak-47, preparing to 
fire. schaefer tackles dillon, the two men hurling into the air, a 
moment later bullets ripping into the crates behind where they were 
standing.

dillon rises up, kicking over a crate, shooting the guerrilla who is 
trying to bring the gun around to fire at him.

schaefer crouches, covering the upper entrances to the palapa, as 
ramirez rushes past, joining schaefer. from the corner of his eye, 
schaefer catches a movement. with a whipping, backhanded throw, he lets 
fly his commando machete... 

the machete impales the attacking guerrilla, driving him backwards, 
pinning him to a post.

schaefer
stick around.

schaefer and ramirez run towards the lower levels, side by side, firing 
as they go.

they reach a door, schaefer taking out an attacking guerrilla. ramirez 
grabs the side of the door, shoots a look to schaefer and throws it 
open. with schaefer covering him, ramirez takes a quick peak inside and 
then rushes into the room.
