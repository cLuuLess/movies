ext. schaefer - night

over the sounds of the fire and the softly flowing river, distinguishes 
a new sound, one that brings fear and a savage determination to his 
heart: the rhythmical click-scrape, click-scrape of the hunter's feet, 
moving over the rocks, somewhere above him.

drawing back on the bow, schaefer moves around the boulder to his left, 
heading towards the sound of the hunter.
