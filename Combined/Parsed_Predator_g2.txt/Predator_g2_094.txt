he throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges forward, 
grabbing the mini-gun. as he stands, the cartridge belt, attached to 
blain, strings out between them.

terrible weapon. mac sweeps the mini-gun from left to right, like a man 
possessed, mowing down the jungle.

ramirez opens fire with the six-shooter grenade launcher... explosions 
rock the jungle.
