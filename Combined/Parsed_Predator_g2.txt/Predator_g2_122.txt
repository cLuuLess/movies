ext. log crossing - day

the jungle is still deathly silent. schaefer, anna and ramirez cross 
the log, moving onto the other side. billy, still at the foot of the 
log, providing cover, turns to face the jungle.

he lifts his head towards the trees, feeling the onrushing presence of 
the hunter. he shrugs off the radio letting it fall, smashing into the 
rocks below.

he casts away his weapon. staring forward he reaches into his cargo 
pocket, withdrawing a small grease-paint tin. covering his finger in 
black paint he applies dark slashes under his eyes and again, 
vertically down his cheeks. taking another dap of paint he makes a 
symbol on his bare skin, over his heart.

he drops the tin, withdrawing his combat knife. holding the knife he 
grasps the medicine bag around his neck, yanking it free with a quick 
snap. he wraps the leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the 
weapon and bag together.

staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low chant.

on the other side, schaefer carrying ramirez on his back, laboring up 
the steep slope, nearing the top, turns and sees billy standing, 
waiting at the foot of the bridge.

schaefer
(screaming)
billy!!!

but billy stands at the foot of the bridge, knife raised, waiting, 
accepting his oncoming destiny.

schaefer
billy!!!

in frustration, schaefer hikes ramirez higher onto his back, digs in 
and sprints to the top of the hill, anna waiting at the top.
