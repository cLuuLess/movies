int. palapa - day

schaefer is talking to hawkins who has the field radio set on a crate 
just outside the door.

hawkins
(urgent)
major, we stepped into some real shit here. i got a hook-up with aerial 
surveillance.

schaefer
movement?

hawkins
(nods)
guerrillas swarming like flies all over the place. can't be more then 
one, maybe two miles away. place is going down, major.

schaefer
how much time?

hawkins
half an hour, maybe less.

schaefer touches him on the shoulder.

schaefer
(urgently)
tell mac we move in five.

he starts to walk away.

dillon (o.s.)
she goes with us.

schaefer turns. dillon is at the doorway, supporting the still groggy 
anna.

dillon
she's too valuable. she's got to know their whole network. the whole 
set up. we take her with us.

schaefer
we take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. 
no prisoners, dillon.

dillon grabs the handset from hawkin's radio, shoving it at schaefer.

dillon
you're still under orders, dutch. you want to make the call, or should 
i?

schaefer looks at the handset. then at dillon, he knows dillon's won.

he starts to walk away but stops, turning back, pointing a finger at 
dillon.

schaefer
i'm getting my men out of this damn jungle, dillon. she's your baggage. 
you fall behind, you're on your own.
