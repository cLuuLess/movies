ext. hunter's pov - day

he's looking directly at schaefer, except he can't see him.

he can clearly see the exposed root-system, but because of the heavy 
mud blocking schaefer's body heat, schaefer registers in the hunter's 
vision as merely an indistinct lump of clay, unrecognizable to the 
hunter as a human being.

he scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources. detecting none 
he moves on sounding a questioning trill several times.


back to scene - schaefer

disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye, seeing the hunter's 
feet move away, his prehensile spurs dragging in the mud. he rounds a 
bend and disappears, heading for the undergrowth.

astonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a sudden jabbing pain 
in his shoulder causes him to collapse, falling onto his side, 
unconscious in the mud.
