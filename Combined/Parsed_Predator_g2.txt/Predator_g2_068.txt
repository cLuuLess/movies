ext. anna and dillon - jungle - day

have fallen behind, dillon looking worriedly ahead at the them out 
distancing them. anna is keeping her pace purposefully slow. she trips 
on a root falling to the ground. she lies there, motionless. he quickly 
reaches down to haul her to her feet.

dillon
(urgently)
shit. come on... 

like an uncoiled spring, anna turns, flinging a handful of dirt into 
his face, momentarily blinding him. she lunges for his rifle with her 
bound hands.

suddenly the barrel of an mp-5 is thrust into her face.

looking up she sees ramirez, calmly holding the weapon on her, the look 
in his eyes indicating he'd hove no trouble shooting her.

ramirez
(in spanish)
don't try it.

she looks back at dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes. she moves on. 
ramirez gives him a cold look as dillon hurries past.

ramirez
(coolly)
you should put her on a leash, agent man. if you can't handle her, just 
say the word.

dillon moves on, ignoring ramirez, who turns, scanning the jungle 
behind him before moving on. dillon catches up with anna, turning her 
sharply by the chin.

dillon
(cold; in spanish)
try that again. please.

she looks at him contemptuously, undaunted. she will try it again. she 
breaks away from his grasp and moves on, dillon watching her go, he 
won't hesitate next time.
