ext. jungle - overhead - day

as the assault team passes below, a butterfly lands on what appears to 
be the bark of a tree. it fans its wings and flies on.

the impression of the butterfly remains in perfect relief, as is 
imprinted on the bark. the image fades, revealing for an instant a 
gridwork of tiny scales on the bark.

the bark moves! changing colors, like a chameleon, revealing for an 
instant the form of something alive as it flows into the leaves, once 
again becoming indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

two eyes, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the foliage. they blink, 
disappearing, and then become visible again.
