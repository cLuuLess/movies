int. helicopter - night

the men, suspended in restraining harnesses from the bulkheads, lean 
forward, nearly upside down in response to the radical maneuver, 
handling the situation with ease.

blain holds out the tobacco to ramirez, who swats at the offending 
object as if it were alive.

ramirez
(shouting)
get that stinkin' thing out of my face, blain!

grinning, blain proffers the plug to each man, each one refusing; 
they've done it a thousand times. it's an old gag but they obviously 
care for the man in a big way.

blain
... bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here... 
(holds up plug)
... this stuff will put hair guaranteed... 
(chewing)
... make you a god-damned sexual ty-ran-toe-sore-ass... just like me.

this brings a chorus of hoots and shouts from the others.

the helicopter makes another radical turn.

schaefer and dillon, seated near the cockpit, communicate through 
headsets, also linked to the pilot. they consult a topographical map by 
red penlights.

dillon
(pointing to the map)
our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. awacs 
contact on four hour intervals.

schaefer
who's our back-up on this?

dillon
(grinning)
no such thing, old buddy. it's a one way ticket. once we cross that 
border, we're on our own.

schaefer
this gets better by the minute.
