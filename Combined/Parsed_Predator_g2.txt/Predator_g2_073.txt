ext. billy - at the river bed - day

he remains frozen and transfixed, staring into the treeline. something 
is moving, fluid, silently and downward, into the forest. billy remains 
rooted to the spot, lost in concentration.


schaefer

sensing something very wrong with billy, moves alongside mac.

schaefer
what's got billy so spooked?

mac
can't say, major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... 
sometimes i think that nose of his is too good... smells things that 
ain't there.

schaefer signals for mac to cover him and then moves low and quiet 
towards billy. dillon appears, looking to mac for an explanation. mac 
ignores him, concentrating on the jungle. dillon looks forward at... 

billy, his eyes riveted to the capony above, as he unconsciously 
reaches to his throat, grasping a leather pouch, secured to his neck by 
a thong. he fingers the medicine bag talisman.
