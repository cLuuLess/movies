int. hunter's ship - night

a force field that permeates the jungle, becoming one with the trees 
and foliage. the hunter walks down a corridor of solid light, leading 
to an opening to the jungle. as the hunter reaches the doorway he 
changes from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.
