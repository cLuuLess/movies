ext. guerrilla village - day

schaefer and billy are kneeling on the ground near the trailhead, 
studying a map. in the background, the team, hidden, covers the 
hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and wary, weapons ready.

schaefer
this place is too hot for a pick-up. they won't touch us until we're 
over the border. we can lift at lz 49, here.
(points to map)
spotter plane says we're cut off.
(points to map)
except for this valley.

billy shakes his head, following the contour lines of the rugged 
terrain.

billy
looks bad, major. it's gonna be a real bitch.
(points to map)
if we follow above the river and then down, here, at this canyon, we 
might find a way out.

schaefer turns to ramirez, kneeling close by.

schaefer
(decisively)
not much choice. pancho, take the lead. double time it.

he turns and looks at dillon, anna as his side, her forehead bandaged, 
her hands bound in front of her. he turns back to the others.

schaefer
lock n' load, watch your ass.

blain moves out, swinging the mini-gun in front of him as he goes.
