ext. ramirez

entering the alleyway where hawkins was killed he sees anna, cowering 
in the bushes, her blood splattered face glazed with terror, his eyes 
vacant. he approaches, angry, wary, but the girl is so stunned. he sees 
the trail of blood and crushed grasses leading into the jungle. he 
gives a low whistle and then moves on, the rest of the team assuming 
defensive positions around the clearing.

he follows the trail, finding first hawkins' blood-covered weapon, and 
then, a few yards later, the radio. ramirez cautiously parts the brush 
before him. a look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes of his face.
