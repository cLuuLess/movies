ext. guerrilla village

at the entrance way to the main palapa, a guerrilla stands in the 
doorway, giving cover fire to his comrades as they fall back inside.

jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, billy drops directly in 
front of the guerrilla.

from the side, unseen by billy, another guerrilla thrusts out with a 
knife, billy ducking backwards, the tip of the knife slashing his face. 
with a lightning move, billy whips his arm up and around the guerrilla, 
locking his elbow, breaking the joint.

still holding the man he fires, blowing the other guerrilla off his 
feet with the shotgun portion of his weapon. he looks at the guerrilla 
out of the corner of his eye. he suddenly strikes, breaking his neck, 
dropping him in a heap.

billy continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the m-203.

meanwhile, blain is crouched next to a tree, providing cover. behind 
blain, at the edge of the camp, circling around from below, two 
guerrillas appear and fire a grenade round which explodes behind blain, 
fragments ripping into the tree next to which blain is standing, bark 
and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one piece tearing into 
his upper shoulder. the hits have no effect on the huge man and with a 
savage growl, he spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the 
mini-gun.

nearby, mac charges from the jungle on a dead run, diving over a fallen 
tree as machine gun fire rakes the ground around him.

blain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens fire with the mini-
gun, shredding the tree, sending the guerrilla crashing down through 
the roof of the palapa.
