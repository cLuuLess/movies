ext. hunter's pov - anna and hawkins - day

as he hurtles towards them, their faces frozen in surprise


back to scene - anna and hawkins

a splitting thud as hawkins is hurtled backwards into the undergrowth, 
the hunter's hand and weapon flashing through the air. 

blood splashes on anna's face. she screams as hawkins' mp-5 fires a 
short burst into the air.
