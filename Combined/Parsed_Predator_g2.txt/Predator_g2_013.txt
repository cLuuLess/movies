int. helicopter - night

dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing ramirez a battered 
cigarette lighter from a famed commando unit from the past.

but his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing mac, who regards dillon 
with the cold suspicion reserved for an outsider. mac looks up at 
blain, his eyes narrowing.

blain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew. he pauses, eyes 
moving downward, spotting his target.

he hocks a thick, vile stream of tobacco juice directly between 
dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous skein lacing across the 
toe of one boot. dillon looks up, his face goes cold and menacing.

dillon
(icy)
man, that's a real bad habit you've got.

dillon turns back to ramirez, ignoring mac and blain, who continues to 
stare at him. mac looks across at blain, wide grins breaking across 
their huge faces. cradled in blain's arms, as if it were a part of his 
body, is a large, canvas-covered bundle. blain looks down at his 
bundle, almost affectionately.

the pilot's voice breaks in over schaefer's headset.

pilot number one (v.o.)
lz comin' up in 30 seconds. stand by the rappel lines.

looking up, schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest man who nods 
and in return, passes the signal down the line.

ramirez and blain pick up heavy, metal conical devices, attached to 
canvas bags filled with rope.
