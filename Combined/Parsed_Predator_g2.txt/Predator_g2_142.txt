ext. boulder field - night

where the river flows into a series of falls and pools, surrounded by 
massive boulders and table top rocks, their crevices jammed with large 
amounts of driftwood swept down at high water from the forests above.

on a flattened section of rock, schaefer drags a large section of 
branches into view, adding it to a growing mound of firewood. he 
kneels, tending to a pile of dries grass, leaves and other tinder. 
using the last of his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, 
gently coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consuming fire, flames 
starting to lick upward through the dry wood.

he stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze. he turns, facing the 
canyon rim, raising his weapons in one hand. from the depths of his 
soul, a sound emerges; primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in 
pain.

he throws back his head and shouts.
