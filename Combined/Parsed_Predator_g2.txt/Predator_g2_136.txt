ext. river - day

as a huey attack helicopter breaks over the top of the ridge, diving 
forward, moving down the canyon. the chopper flares up into a holding 
pattern.

in the open doorway, a soldier searches the top of the canyon with 
binoculars. seeing no sign of life, the chopper flies on, disappearing 
down the canyon rim.


back to scene - schaefer

lies unconscious in the mud, the distant sound of the helicopter 
thrumping into the distance.
