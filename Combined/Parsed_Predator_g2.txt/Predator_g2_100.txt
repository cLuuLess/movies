int. hunter's ship - day (dusk)

the hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse, the prehensile 
spur digging deep, pinioning the body to the ground. the hunter's hand 
extends, his fingers puncturing the skin at the base of the spine, 
gripping the vertebrae.

with otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire spinal column 
ripping free from the body, a sickly snapping and popping of cartilage 
separating from bone and tissue.
