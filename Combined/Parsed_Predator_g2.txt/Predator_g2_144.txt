ext. hunter's ship - night

backlit by the light of the open door, the hunter's head, in three-
quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears into view, looking up at the 
sky, hearing schaefer's cry.

responding with a low hiss, he turns back, raising in one hand his 
weapon, in the other a u-shaped sharpening device. as he passes the 
weapon through the device, it flashes into life, a deep, harmonic hum 
emitted as the blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and 
hotter with each stroke. he draws the blade now white-hot through the 
device for the last stroke. he lifts it, testing its balance, the 
white-hot blade illuminating his alien face.
