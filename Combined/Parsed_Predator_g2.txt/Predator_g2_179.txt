int. helicopter - day 

schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the remains of his mud 
camouflage, his body laced with deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked 
with dried blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

near the cockpit are general philips, an army medic, two machine 
gunners. they look at schaefer in awe.

the medic, holding an open field kit, a syringe and bandages, turns to 
philips.

medic
(shaking his head)
looks like he's been through hell... can't believe he's still alive. 
what the hell went on down there?

philips
if it hadn't been for her, he'd be dead now. that story she told us... 
i still can't believe it.

he looks at anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking for an 
explanation. she looks at him a moment before turning back to schaefer, 
staring at him as if he were risen from the dead.

she looks into schaefer's face, schaefer returning her look, 
recognition passing between them. anna extends her hand. schaefer 
slowly reaches out, touching her fingers, then clasping her hand.

schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door, beyond the passing 
jungle below, out to the heavens. he turns back, looking at anna, a 
faint smile crossing his face... they made it.
