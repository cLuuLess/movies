ext. jungle coastline - day (magic hour)

through a collage of shimmering heat-waves, a dark, other-worldly 
object drops into view, backlit by the fiery, orange-red sphere of a 
setting tropical sun, heading slowly towards us, floating, as if 
suspended by the rising heat of the jungle.

continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves into a military 
assault helicopter, its rotors strobing in the fading sunlight. drawing 
closer, the sound of powerful turbines, throbbing in the heavy air, 
becomes dominant, overpowering.

guided by colored smoke and landing lights, the chopper looms hard into 
view, pitching forward and settling to the ground, kicking up a 
maelstrom of dust and vegetation.
