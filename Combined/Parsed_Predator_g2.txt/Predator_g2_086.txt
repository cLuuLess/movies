ext. ramirez - day

ramirez runs forward ten paces, drops to a crouch, scanning to each 
side. immediately schaefer runs forward twenty paces. as he passes 
ramirez, ramirez turns and scans the rear and flanks.

dillon, mac and blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging forward, 
canvassing the jungle, providing areas of intersection cover.
