as the observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal experience of 
sight and sound unfolds:

bullets streak through the air, leaving blood-red trails of heat, like 
laser blasts. as they impact into the guerillas, we hear the enhanced 
slapping of bullets, seeing tiny blossoms of heat mushroom out of their 
bodies.

we hear the horrific, deformed cries and screams of the dying men.

another searing, blinding explosion sends pieces of shrapnel ripping 
through the air, some of them roaring past the observer's position, 
like tiny meteors.
