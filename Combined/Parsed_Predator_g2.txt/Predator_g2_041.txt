holds his huge, commando machete on a diagonal, pushing through the 
belt, slicing it cleanly. turning he crawls silently to the rear of the 
truck, positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton truck.

pushes forward. he rolls aside, disappearing into the ground cover as 
the truck, its tireless rims digging into the earth, lops down the 
hill, slowly picking up speed.
