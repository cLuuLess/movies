int. room - day

at one end is a stairway, leading to an escape door. a guerrilla, seen 
from the waist up, scrambles down the stairs.

at the base of the stairs, a guerrilla, holding an ak-47 on his hip, 
turns and starts to fire.

schaefer and ramirez respond with full auto bursts which rip into the 
guerrilla, spinning him around, knocking over a crude wooden table, 
scattering a briefcase with burning papers, food cans, and liquor 
bottles.

as he spins he fires the weapon, an arcing line of slugs slamming into 
the tin roof, sending down a shower of rust and dirt. he falls to the 
ground. dead.

ramirez charges through the dust and thick smoke to cover the fallen 
men; schaefer following close behind, jerking a new clip from his ammo 
belt.

suddenly, another guerrilla erupts from behind some ammunition crates, 
drawing down on ramirez with a machine pistol.

schaefer
(shouting)
down!!!

as the guerrilla fires, schaefer smashes the butt of his empty weapon 
into the guerrilla's shoulder, knocking the gun aside, the slugs 
thudding into the wall harmlessly.

he hits the guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to the head with the 
barrel of his weapon. the guerrilla is hurled backward, crashing into 
the wooden crates and to the floor.

ramirez, recovering quickly, descends the stairs with catlike agility, 
disappearing.

schaefer crouches and spins, jamming a new clip into the rifle, 
scanning the palapa for any other movement. he races to the main door 
of the room, shouting into the palapa.

he sees blain charging down the steps. catching his attention he 
signals him on, out the back to cover ramirez.

schaefer
(to hawkins)
hawk, get con. op. on the hook! position and situation, now!

as blain runs down the stairs, hawkins already has the radio off his 
back, setting up the portable satellite dish antenna.

hawkins
you got it, major!
