int. hunter's ship - night

close on an oval chamber made of an otherworldly looking metal with a 
strange copperlike patina, its interior bathed in intense blue light. 
in the chamber is hawkins' skull cap and spinal column still attached.

the light field suddenly changes as all connective tissue, flesh and 
blood and drawn away from the bony structures with incredible force, 
disintegrating as they rush toward the sides of the chamber.

the light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the hunter's hands 
remove the glazed, polished trophy from the chamber. he turns, 
carefully placing it upon a glowing surface. he touches the trophy 
gently, feeling its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big 
cat. he pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque force field covers 
the trophies.
