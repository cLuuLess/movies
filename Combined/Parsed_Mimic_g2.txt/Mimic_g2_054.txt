     susan and peter.

                          susan
                ...you don't even know what you're
                looking for.

                          peter
                you said that thing was big as your
                hand.  i don't think i'm going to
                miss...

                          susan
                why take the chance?  just let me go
                down there with you...

                          peter
                no.

     susan glares at him.  peter sits down by her.

                          peter
                susan, listen to me:  you handled
                that insect almost as much as siri...

                          susan
                it didn't bite me.

                          peter
                i know.  but if it was carrying
                something...there's a chance you
                could have been exposed.

     susan is silent.

                          peter
                chris is going to run some blood
                tests on you.  i want you to stay here
                till he's absolutely sure you're
                clean.  okay? then you'll call me...
                you'll catch up with us...

     susan looks up at him. finally, she nods.

                          peter
                we'll be all right, sus.  i promise.

     he leans over, kisses her gently.  but susan seems
     hardly reassured.

                                                            cut to:
