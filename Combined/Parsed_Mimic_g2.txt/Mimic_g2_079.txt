     int. tunnels

     peter undoes his belt.

                          peter
                     (to manny and leonard)
                give me your belts.

     they obey. peter buckles them together with his. he then
     loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.

                          leonard
                     (to manny, as he ties them
                     together)
                what are you doing down here?

                          manny
                chuy. he was taken. he's down here
                somewhere...
                     (to peter)
                oh, please, hurry. i saw what was
                after her.

                          peter
                what's...?

                          manny
                just hurry.

     peter takes his word for it.  he uses the belts to lower
     himself to the nearest pipe.

     leonard lights a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.

     peter works his way down. the web of pipes seem to recede
     into hades.

     the lifeline tightens.

     peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his
     stomach and lets the belts down.

                          peter
                i'm coming, sus, i'm coming.

     but then, he sees something move below her. then a hollow
     clang! clang! clang!

                          susan
                no, jesus, no.

                          peter
                     (to leonard)
                toss the flare down!

                          leonard
                i only got...

                          peter
                just do it!

     leonard lets the flare drop from his hand.

     it falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes,
     spinning down to the pitch-black below.

     and for a split second the flame illuminates...

     the mimic

     pipe in its thorax, nimbly climbing the pipes toward susan
     clang! clang! clang!

     peter's

     eyes grow huge.

                          peter
                oh, jesus...

     leonard

     just plain loses it.

                          leonard
                what the fuck is that?! what the fuck is
                that?!

     susan

     knows all too well what's coming for her.

                          susan
                     (a desperate appeal)
                peter...

     throwing caution to the wind, peter reaches the belt down.

                          peter
                wrap it around your hand!

     susan at last gets a grip.  peter pulls with both arms.

     clang! clang! clang! getting closer.

                          peter
                come on!

     susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes,
     ascending foot by foot...

     peter pulls her into his arms.

     clang! clang! clang!

     peter bends down.

                          peter
                get on my shoulders!

     susan steps onto his shoulders.  he pushes her up...

     and leonard and manny yank her out.

     clang! clang! clang!

     peter scrambles up, slams the lid back on the hole.

                          peter
                let's go!

     the four of them run.

     hold on the lid.

     wham! it bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.
