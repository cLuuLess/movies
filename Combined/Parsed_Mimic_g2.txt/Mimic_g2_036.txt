     int. subway station - day

     a blur of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing sound.

     at the end of the platform, davis untwists a wire around the
     busted lock of a locker room door. peter paces nervously
     nearby.

                          peter
                here, let me...

     he starts on it himself. meanwhile, ricky stares at a
     photograph susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-
     brown colored eggcase.

                          susan
                you sure you didn't see one of these?

                          ricky
                gross. what is it?

                          susan
                an "ootheca". an eggcase. it probably had
                more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.

                          ricky
                     (shakes his head)
                no way. i see one of those, i'd puke.

     davis opens the door with a click.
