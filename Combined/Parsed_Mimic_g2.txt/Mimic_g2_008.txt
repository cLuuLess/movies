     int. living room

     nothing grand.  peter in his shorts at a tv with shitty
     reception.  he adjusts the disgruntled cable box.

     he is seen over the tv, giving his address.

                          peter
                fucking thing! i hope someone's taping
                this.
                     (out.)
                susan, come on.  it's really good this
                time. i got most of the lines out.
                     (no response.)
                sus?

     peter sighs. he picks up an open bottle of champagne and
     two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.
