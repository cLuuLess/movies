     int. subway locker room

     a dark, abandoned locker room once used for transit workers.

     susan and peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-
     limits area.

                          davis
                it was in that corner over there.

     davis points to a bank of dented metal lockers.

                          ricky
                sucker was fast, man.
                     (picks up a pipe.)
                had to take it out with one a these.

                          peter
                okay, guys.  we'll take it from here.

     peter hands ricky some money. the boy looksdown at it
     slyly.

                          ricky
                make it ten an' we won't tell the cops
                you're here.

     peter regards the little scam artist dryly.

                          peter
                let's keep it at five and i won't
                condemn your clubhouse.

     peter hands him a couple of dollars more. the two boys
     take off.

     peter removes a penlight from his pocket.

     dust covers everything. a forest of copper tubing and pipes
     where the sinks used to be.

     peter

     inspects the floor. it's littered with cheap objects:
     chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared
     heroin syringes.

     something shiny catches his eye. he picks it up.

                          peter
                     (quietly)
                look, a broken tooth...

     something rustles nearby.

     he notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  it
     seems oddly textured somehow.  he walks toward it.

     susan

     kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. behind it, there
     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.

     a subway train rumbles by outside, the sound echoes off
     the tile walls.

     susan forces the door back. she peeks through the opening.

     her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.
     she starts pulling something out.

     peter

     at the oddly texture wall.  he shines the penlight at it...

     ...and is met with a flutter of wings.  moths, perfectly
     camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.

     peter recoils.

                          susan (os)
                you okay?

     he nods.

     susan

     turns back to her locker.  she withdraws a cheap plastic
     necklace from it.  as she removes it, it breaks.  a coulpe of
     beads fall away...

     ...rolls under the locker...

     ...and bounce -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going
     deeper till they comes to a stop.

     susan peers where the beads fell.

                          susan
                there's something under here.

     peter comes over, kneels by her. susan takes a handful of
     beads and throws them at the base of the locker.

     camera tracks to follow one of them. it rolls all the way
     under.

     a moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it
     bouncing on cement. he shines his light inside.
