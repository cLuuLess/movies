     int. subway tunnels - "y" section

     leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth.

     sounds of the mimics approaching. he glances at the third
     rail beside him, then down the track.

                          leonard
                come here, you mealy-mouthed...

     the sound gets louder.

                          leonard
                multi-legged...

     leonard raises his baton in top mta form.

                          leonard
                maggot-munchin' motherfu...

     thud!  several mimcs slam onto leonard!

     leonard goes down, hitting them futilely with his baton.

     they begin to tear at his limbs.

     leonard rolls...

     ...kicks his good leg out...

     ...and connects with the third rail.

     an arc of electricity lights up the darkness, consuming
     leonard and the mimics.
