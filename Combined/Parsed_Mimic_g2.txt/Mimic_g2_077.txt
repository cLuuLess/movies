     int. remains of the subway station

     a ring of flares burns in the darkness like an island.  peter
     lights another one, revealing a space buried in layers of
     dust and time.

     cracked mannequin faces stares out from an unopened tailor
     shop.  a flower parlor decorated with cobwebs.  a yellowed
     newspaper on the floor, its headlines reading:  german troops
     driven back across rhine.

     peter looks up to see leonard approaching from the track.

                          peter
                any luck?

                          leonard
                well...there's an old service elevator
                half a mile down the tracks.  ain't gonna
                be much use, though.  lines are dead.

     peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which hum
     ominously with electricity.

                          peter
                you said those cables're still live.
                can't we rewire...?

                          leonard
                oh, man, there you go again.

                          peter
                what?

                          leonard
                those things bring juice to the new
                stations.  you just can't rewire that
                shit...

     peter approaches him.

                          peter
                for chrissakes, what's the problem?
                you need a memo every time you fart?

                          leonard
                all right, motherfucker, that's it.

     he pushes peter violently. their eyes lock and meet.
     inches away from a fistfight.

                          peter
                shh! shh!

     a sound rushing towards them, its echoes increasing by the
     second.

     where is it coming from?

     peter looks at leonard.  leonard unbuttons his holster clip,
     places his hand on his .22

     a shadow appears outside the archway.

     it steps onto the platform.

     leonard frowns.

                          leonard
                     (tentative)
                manny?!

     the old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath. a
     rusted crowbar in his hand.

     leonard walks over to him solicitously.

                          leonard
                my god, what the hell are you...?

                          manny
                hurry, the woman needs help!

     a shadow crosses peter's face.

                          peter
                woman?

                                                            cut to:
