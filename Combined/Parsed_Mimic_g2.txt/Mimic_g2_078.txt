     outstretched hands in the darkness.

     reveal peter leaning across the void with one hand while
     manny and leonard grip his other.

     susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing
     pipes. a mess, but still alive.  she reaches up to peter.

     it's too far.

                          susan
                     (a whisper)
                don't.

                          peter
                listen to me:  we're getting you out.

     leonard and manny pull peter back into
