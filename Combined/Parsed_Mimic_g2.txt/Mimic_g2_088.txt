     int. by the cage elevator

     the crackling sound echoes through to peter and susan.

     susan hits the elevator button again.

                          susan
                i can't tell if it's working!

     peter has unbarred the gate.

     susan

     looks up, into the shaft.

     the elevator

     coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.

                          susan
                oh, come on, come on!

                          peter
                jump in.

     peter pulls her into the shaft, closes the security gate
     behind them.
