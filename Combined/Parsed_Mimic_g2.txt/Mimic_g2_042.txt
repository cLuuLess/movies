     int. subway platform - later

     shh-shh-shh.  a felt rag is expertly being pulled across a
     set of pristine black shoes.

     reveal leonard sitting like a king in a chair, getting his
     shoes shined by manny.  he leans back laconically while
     arguing with peter. ernest examines the ootheca picture.

                          peter
                look, i showed you my badge...

                          leonard
                yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot
                bigger one you wanna go down there.
                that's the old maintenance grid, doc.
                swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...

                          peter
                the department of public health...

                          leonard
                ...should know better'n to go sneakin'
                around my turf...

                          peter
                fine.  you want me to call your
                supervisor?

                          leonard
                please do.  he's a lonely guy.

     uninterested, leonard looks over to susan and chuy.

     angle on susan

     she leans against the wall, inspects her dirty hand. ernest
     gives her his handkerchief.

                          chuy (os)
                gucci.  flat pump.

     she looks down at chuy, who sits nearby, holding a pair of
     spoons.

                          ernest
                your shoes.

     she stares down at her shoes.  gucci flat pumps, all right.
     susan smiles.

     just then, a subway train pulls up.  the doors open,
     disgorging passengers. chuy flips into action.  he starts
     playing his spoons, clicking them together, slapping them
     against his knee.

     susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons
     to imitate the different rhythmical step patterns of the
     various commuters: the rolling, comical gait of a fat man,
     the lithe haughty step of a prim lady.

                          susan
                     (laughs.  to chuy.)
                that's wonderful!  what grade are you in?

     chuy doesn't answer.

                          ernest
                no school. shoes're all chuy knows about.

     ernest discreetly points to his forehead.

                          manny
                     (immediately)
                he's special.

                          leonard
                he can imitate anything, you just watch
                him.

                          peter
                     (irritably, to leonard)
                excuse me, i'm talking to you.

                          leonard
                no, you talkin' at me.

     leonard hands manny a $5.00 bill for the shine, gets up and
     walks past peter as if he were invisible.

                          ernest
                     (discreetly, to susan)
                is there some reward for this?

                          susan
                i guess that could be arranged.

     ernest smiles, pockets the ootheca picture.

                          peter
                for chrissakes.  you gonna lay a two-
                bit bureaucratic, territorial number
                on me?

                          leonard
                you wanna keep up the conversation, you
                best come back with the proper permits
                and the right attitude.

     leonard saunters away with ernest in tow.

     peter shakes his head angrily.  he takes susan by the arm,
     heads off in another direction.

     chuy, without watching, clicks his spoons to the imitation of
     their steps.
