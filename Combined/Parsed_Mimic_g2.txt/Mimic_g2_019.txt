     int. mounting room - dusk

     sunlight slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live
     and mounted dead insects, trapped in turn-of-the-century
     glass fronted cabinets. davis puts his nose up against one,
     fascinated.

                          susan
                metaxonycha godmani, trigonopelastes
                delta.  field butterflies.  have you been
                upstate?

     she examines the boys' findings, mostly rag-tag specimens
     of battered butterflies.

                          davis
                avenue b.

                          susan
                     (sadly)
                i guess they got lost in this city.

                          ricky
                so, you wanna buy em?

                          davis
                there's extra wings in the bag.

     siri lingers in the background.

                          susan
                you guys have done a nice job.  how bout
                five dollars?

                          ricky
                     (dismayed)
                that's it?

                          davis
                     (to ricky)
                show her the weirdbug.

     he indicates the shoebox-

                          ricky
                cost a dollar just to look.

                          davis
                it's a great bug.  we kinda broke it a
                little...

     siri impatiently points at the wall clock-

                          susan
                fellas, i'll tell you what...ten dollars
                for everything.  plus a killing jar, some
                tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you
                catch will be in better shape.

                          davis
                deal!

                          ricky
                you crazy! that's the best!!

                          davis
                bug's almost dead anyway.

     susan holds out two five dollar bills.  the boys can't
     resist.  davis grabs the money-

                          davis
                thanks, lady.

     ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box, then
     follows davis out.

     siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it.

                          siri
                ten dollars?

     susan places all the kid's items -including the shoebox- in
     a wastebasket.

                          susan
                alphabet city kids- there's much worse
                things they could be selling.

     siri hits the window frame with a paperweight, gets it half
     way down.

                          siri
                i hate this fucking window...
