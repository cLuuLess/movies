     int. sweat shop. basement

     peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway.

     basement showers

     a tiled nightmare. concentration camp-cozy. a pile of old,
     rusting sewing machines clutter the floor, spilling
     oxide to a central grate.

                          josh
                two shifts, people rotating from bed to
                work.  one toilet. we're in wal-mart
                hell, here.

     josh swats a fly.

                          peter
                did they get the sleazebag who owns this
                place?

                          josh
                triad, chinese mafia. they bring people
                from yunan. slave labor...
                     (eyes his notebook)
                reverend harry wong, a preacher had the
                flophouse fronting for them. no sign of
                him.

     an overhead door is opened. daylight streams in. peter spots
     yang, an asian cop, talking to a chinese woman lying on a
     stretcher which hasn't been moved yet.  she is hollow-eyed,
     near death.  her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for
     dear life.

                          peter
                tell her she's going to be alright.
                we'll take care of her.

     peter kneels next to her, looking at her and nodding while
     yang translates. the woman mutters again, tears of fear in
     her eyes.  yang shakes his head.

                          yang
                she's delirious.  keeps saying the "dark
                angels" are coming for her. she says
                they took some of her people away.

                          peter
                dark angels?

                          yang
                     (shrugs.)
                probably a gang.  chinese people, man.
                they come up with some wacky stuff.

     they pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door
     and into an

     alley

     the stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle, its lights
     flashing. unseen by them, on a brick wall, nearly buried by
     graffiti, is a crude drawing.

     it is of the same, odd figure peter saw drawn earlier.  the
     overcoat man.
