     int. elevator shaft

     the albino sees the elevator approaching from above.

     it gives a few clicks to its minions.

     the two other mimics race up the shaft...

     ...toward the elevator...

     ...and wedge themselves in on either side!

     they are crushed instantly.  but the elevator is stopped just
     above the open gate.

     with just enough room for the albino to get through to
