                there's plenty of systemic infection
                already, so as soon as we get a
                preliminary reading, start them on
                anti-biotics. you saw this?

     peter flicks on his penlight, examines the old man's eyes.
     one of them is completely bloodshot. then he shows josh
     the gums. they're bleeding.
