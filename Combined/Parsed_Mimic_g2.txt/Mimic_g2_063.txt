     int. subway tracks

     water dripping from overhead, echoing footsteps- very
     spooky.  leonard leads peter and josh down the tunnel-

                          leonard
                you all watch your step.  we got some
                burrows goin' down seven stories
                here.  you fall, i don't wanna have to
                come pick you up.

                          josh
                     (whisper to peter)
                new york's finest.

     monumental archways give way to naves as big as notre dame.

     josh flashes the ultra-violet light over an abandoned
     underground encampment, made of cardboard walls, electrical
     wiring, elaborate debris kitchens. the walls are completely
     taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and
     messages. everything from "kilroy was here" to
     elaborate quotations from the bible.

                          josh
                there's really people living down here?

                          leonard
                mole people. this section was pretty
                popular, all the way to fulton street...

     their flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust. the air is
     heavy.

                          leonard
                substance abusers, mental cases... then
                about a year ago, poof! all gone. rumors
                got started... someone found a couple of
                stiffs...

     they work their way down a steep incline. they're covered in
     sweat.

                          leonard
                down here's the land of talk, see? so the
                wildest version goes the farthest. they
                mark that area with a sign or a drawing,
                and its as good as closed.
                     (chuckles)
                we had one fella... for years said he was
                bela lugosi. got him on geraldo.

     peter's cellular rings. he picks up -big static-

     intercut with:

     morgue

     susan's got the phone up on her shoulder, clamped against her
     ear. raymond's cranking out a bunch of polaroids. color shots
     of the insect, from every angle.

                          susan
                it's me. can you hear me?

                          peter
                     (phone, barely audible)
                yeah, barely. we haven't found
                anything down here. nothing...

     jeremy goes to the fridge for a beer.

                          susan
                i have.

     the fridge light plays over the large insects jaws. it makes
     out a few new ridges and valleys. raymond snaps a couple of
     polaroids.

                          susan
                i'm on my way. i've got something for you
                to look at...

     susan notices something weird and undefinable about the
     contours of the claws... but she can't put her finger on
     it.

     back at the tunnel

                          peter
                we'll be back at the platform in...

                          leonard
                20 minutes. if you don't go sight-seeing
                anymore.

                          peter
                     (to phone.)
                20 minutes.
                     (beat.)
                susan?

     the call is lost. peter tries to change frequencies, but it's
     useless.

     peter replaces the phone in his pocket.  he walks off.

                          leonard
                funny.  shoulda seen some track
                bunnies by now.

                          josh
                what?

                          leonard
                track bunnies.  rats.  they're
                usually around.

     no one notices the overcoat man carving on the wall.

                                                            cut to:
