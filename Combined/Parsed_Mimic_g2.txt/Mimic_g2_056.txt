     ext. sewage filtration plant - predawn

     sewage water bubbles in huge tanks.

     a workman walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the
     larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling
     hooks.  shoes, tires, rags...

     a grinding sound is heard.  the workman yells out to a
     control booth above.

                          workman
                hold up!  we gotta block on filter d.

     sound of the pump coming to a halt.

     the workman walks to the filter area.  he sinks his grappling
     hook into the polluted waters.

     underwater shot

     spooky, silent. the grappling hook moves like a scythe to the
     filter...

     ...past long, soft filaments of ragged tissue...

     ...and connects with a larger form.

     above water

     the workman feels the grappling hook connecting.  he gives a
     yank, hooking whatever it is.

     he begins pulling it up.

     a pale form bubbles to the surface.

     the workman's face goes pale.

                          workman
                oh, god...

     a grating voice from the control booth is heard over the p.a.

                          control booth
                          voice
                what's the problem?

     it take the workman a moment to speak.

                          workman
                i think it's a baby!

     the workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good)
     toward the edge of the tank.

     he bends down, and now gets his first good look at it.

     the workman screams.

     his grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.

                                                            cut to:
