     int. sweatshop shower room

     empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a
     corner.  we tilt to see josh moving the grate away.  he
     jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-

     his hands slide!!

     pit

     josh puts the old sewing machine upright.

     outside

     suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the
     steel plate hits the ground: klangg!!

     the mimic

     leaps into action!

     pit - josh

     hears the clicking, fairly close.  he shines his light back
     down the hole he entered through-

     josh's pov - the mimic

     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.

     josh

                          josh
                oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

     he stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for
     the floor above-

     sweatshop shower room

     josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  his
     arms tremble. he makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab
     the power cord of one of the abandoned sewing machines.

     the mimic

     rushes through the opening without even slowing down.

     josh

     pulls himself up, up-  wham!  the mimic hits the lower part
     of his body, blood spraying up through the hole.  he screams,
     grasps the cord with both hands!

     he is brutally yanked down into the hole, the sewing machine
     tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges
     violently in the hole!

     we track over to reveal, one of chuy's perfectly
     executed wire sculptures. sitting atop another sewing
     machine.

                                                            cut to:
