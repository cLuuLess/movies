     int. room behind switchroom

     the space is larger than the switchroom.  the walls and
     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.

     manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.

     something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet
     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.

     a rustling behind him.  manny turns around.

                          manny
                     (whispering)
                nino...

     he swings the light onto chuy, sitting on the floor before
     the remains of a rusty column.  that beautiful, emotionless
     smile on his pale face.

                          manny
                chuy...

     by the powerbox

     peter has made all the necessary connections.  he turns now
     to the fuse-section.

     a red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.

     one is still occupied.

     the other one empty.

                          peter
                dammit!

     cu - peter's forehead

     beads of sweat begin to form.

     subway car

     susan watches the mimics at their feast.

     all of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.

                          susan
                     (horrified)
                the scent's fading...

     susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.

                          leonard
                     (tense as hell)
                what's manny doing? i can't see him
                anymore.

     room behind switchroom

                          manny
                nino, please...

     manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture
     of "come to me".

     in the darkness, something that looks like a palm frond
     floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw
     gestures as it falls through the air.

     manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  it's not a palm
     frond.

     it's a wing.

     manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.

     the place is covered with mimics.  they are in the middle of
     a vicious mating ritual.  the males tear savagely at the
     females wings as they proceed to mount them.  a chaotic
     clusterfuck.

     manny is sickened.

     chuy giggles. manny shines his light ahead. manny's face
     falls.

                          manny
                dios mio...

     the white pillar behind chuy is moving...

     ...unfolding...

     ...at last revealing...

     an albino mimic!  another leap for evolution...

     its form is different from the other mimics.  sleeker, more
     supple, almost beautiful.  and while its movements are still
     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to
     them that at the very least entrance us.

     the thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny
     boy.  it stands over him like a king over his court fool.

     chuy giggles happily.  it's all a game to him.

     the albino clicks in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as
     if trying to communicate with the boy.

     chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a
     perfect imitation of the sound.

     manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with
     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  he turns to chuy-

                          manny
                     (barely audible)
                chuy...

                          chuy
                     (whispers)
                friends.

                          manny
                no, no, chuy, no...

                          chuy
                friends.

     the albino clicks his jaws, moving in toward manny.

     chuy

     plays his spoons in perfect imitation.

     manny

     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. he raises his
     arms, like a prophet. he lets go of hsi razor and kneels.

                          manny
                god has closed his eyes. this, he cannot
                see...

     his vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange
     serenity invades him.

     the albino's jaws open and charge.

     platform

     some mimics advance toward peter's direction.

     subway car

     susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,
     trying to attract their attention.

                          susan
                over here! over here! goddam you!!

     by the tracks

     peter breaks the arm off one of his glasses.  he jams it at
     the empty fuse.  it sparks.

     platform

     thump!  the electricity comes on...

     the lamps on the columns burst into flames from the power
     surge.  fire illuminates the station like a greek temple.

     by the tracks

     peter climbs up onto the tracks...

     ...sweat staining his forehead...

     peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.

     the mimics

     clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees
     reacting to honey.

     subway car

                          susan
                     (to leonard)
                the door! open the fucking door!

     leonard

     looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which
     button to press. he begins to press each one in turn.

     peter

     hears the sound of spoons playing.

     he turns to see chuy, standing by the outside of the switch
     room.  the boy smiles. a flashlight shines behind him.

                          peter
                manny...

     but the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:
     the albino steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung
     puppet. his claws and jaws are coated in blood. chuy joyfully
     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.

     the mimics

     climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-

     subway car - control booth

     susan runs in.  slams her hand down on a button.

     fsst!

     the subway car

     the doors open.

                          susan
                peter!!

     peter hesitates, takes a step toward chuy.

                          peter
                come on, kid...

     chuy seeks shelter behind the albino's legs.

                          peter
                     (horrified)
                jesus!

     the albino charges toward him.

                          susan
                run!! peter!!

     peter bolts for the car.

     the mimics

     jump and land

     subway car

     just as peter squeezes through one of the doors.

     bam! thud! the doors dent. glass cracks.

                          susan
                     (yelling to leonard)
                go!!

     susan presses the button. the doors close again.

                          leonard
                the kid...

                          peter
                the kid's with them!!

                          leonard
                what do you-?

                          peter
                go!! just go!!

     control booth

     leonard throws the dead man's switch by the control board.

     subway car

     jolts into action.

     outside

     the train lurches forward.

     wheels spark and kick into gear. the mimics scramble and re-
     assemble quickly, ready to attack.

     the albino

     changes position and charges towards the car.

     the moving car

     reaches a "y" section.  the car moves to the track to the
     right.

     inside subway car

     leonard's eyes go wide as he sees

                          leonard
                he didn't do it!

                          susan
                what?

                          leonard
                manny never threw the coupling switch!!
                we're goin' the wrong way!!!

     outside car

     it keeps bearing right. further away from their destination.

     ...towards an old storage yard in their path.  idle cars and
     repair equipment on the tracks.

     a crash seems inevitable.

     inside the car

     leonard pulls

     the brakes

     but they don't work at all.

     from below the car we see the wheels spinning freely,
     heading for collision.

     inside the car

     susan grabs leonard from the control booth. to peter

                          susan
                move back!!!

     they rush back against the opposite door.

     storage yard - subway car

     craaashh!!  the car bashes into a parked section of train in
     a grin of tearing metal...

     ...flips off the track...

     ...and onto its side...

     the car skids to a stop.  sparks fill the air.

     inside subway car

     all three are hurt.  leonard's leg wound has reopened. peter
     has badly damaged his right arm.

                          susan
                you all right?

     peter nods painfully.  susan to leonard.

                          leonard
                     (simply, re: his leg)
                can't feel it.

     peter and susan sling leonard's arms over their shoulders.
     they raise him up.

     outside subway car

     they move unsteadily outside.

                          susan
                which way?

                          leonard
                across both tracks!!

                          peter
                shit.

     they head off over a concrete island in the direction of the
     correct track.

     further back

     the mimics and the albino moving closer.

     peter and susan

     try to hurry, but it's no use given leonard's condition.

                          leonard
                     (quietly)
                lemme go.

     peter and susan both disregard the order.

                          susan
                we're no leaving you!

                          leonard
                no way we can outrun 'em together.
                move it!

     leonard suddenly grabs his police baton from his belt
     clip.  he pushes the two away.

                          leonard
                now!! go!! get the hell off my beat!

     leonard turns away from them.

     peter goes to get leonard, but susan stops him.  this mta
     officer is staying put.

                          leonard
                come on.  come to poppa.

     reluctantly, the two begin down the tunnel.

     leonard

     takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.
