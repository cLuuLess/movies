     int. hole - peter's hand

     very dark. a highlight glints off a shell-like surface.

     the light barely touches it.

     the whole surface backs away.

     peter drops the penlight.  it gets stuck in a jutting piece
     of concrete.

     peter

                          peter
                shit.

     peter tries to get his hand in

     deeper

     but he cannot reach the light. it is literally inches from
     his fingers...

     she kneels and goes for it.
