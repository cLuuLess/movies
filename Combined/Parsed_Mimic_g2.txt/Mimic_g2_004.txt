     int. hospital - night - floating shot

     we float through a long hospital ward.

     past rows of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in
     the dark like cocoons of light.

                most were children under ten.

     track past tents.  bodies of small children inside, wrapped
     in white sheets, hooked up to ivs or breathing apparatus.
     skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.

     bellows of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.

     image resolves to a video on a screen.

     pull back to reveal a number of screens, each with a
     different set of images.  we are in a news van.   a
     technician and director sit watching.

     the voice belongs to an anchorman who's now overimposed.

                          anchorman
                only after the numbers had reached into
                the thousands were officials able to
                identify the carrier of the deadly
                infection...

                          director
                cut to three.

     the technician manipulates the controls.  on another screen
     we see them cut to stock news footage: regular cockroaches,
     crawling on garbage.

                          anchorman
                blattida germanica.  the common
                cockroach.

                          director
                     (to a runner)
                tell them we're ready for a live feed.
