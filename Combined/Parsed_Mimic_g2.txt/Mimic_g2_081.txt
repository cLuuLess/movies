     int. subway repair car

     ...tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty
     crates.

                          leonard
                get the goddam door!

     leonard and peter both grab its handle, slide it shut...

     splack!  the mimic crashes into it!

     klanggg!  the door bulges out from the impact, almost
     tearing itself off the hinges.

     susan jumps back.  manny runs to cover her.

     the creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and
     forelegs waving wildly!

     the abdomen crashes through a pane of glass.

                          peter
                push it! push it! don't let up!

     leonard and peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.

     the upper half of the mimic tears itself loose.

     white blood spatters everywhere. the mimic is now cut in
     half!

     the wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety
     window's outer panels.

     but the front section is still alive.  it scrabbles in,
     spraying white blood...

     ...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor
     and under a row of shelves in a half-circle around the car
     till it finally comes to a halt.

     silence.  the only sound is a skittering outside.

     susan looks outside the window.

     the mimic's rear half is still trying to push through the
     door, its feet blindly dragging along.

     leonard

                          leonard
                what the fuck was that?

     peter says nothing. leonard grabs him by the shirt.

                          leonard
                you better tell me what the hell's
                going on here!

                          manny
                hey, hey!! take it easy!!

                          peter
                     (to leonard)
                we don't know!! we don't know what it
                is!

     leonard releases peter and, cocking his gun moves closer
     to the still thing.

                          peter
                wait a minute-

                          leonard
                fuck you, wait a minute. i'm
                going to-

     snap!  the mimic pounces on him, catching his leg in its
     front mandibles.

     a sickening crunch as the mimic's mouth begins to work the
     leg like a grinder-blender.

                          leonard
                get it!  get it off me!

     peter and manny try to pull the thing off as leonard falls
     and writhes on the floor.

     bam! bam! bam! the men flinch away as leonard empties his
     guns on it, until the thing's shell finally cracks!

     but the thing is still locked onto leonard's leg.  peter
     tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. no good.

                          peter
                its muscles are locked.

                          leonard
                     (hoarse)
                oh, jesus!!

                          manny
                wait...

     manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat, then starts
     smearing the stuff onto the mimic's head and jaws.

                          leonard
                oh, jesus! it's hitting the bone man, get
                it off!!

     he lights a cigarette lighter, goes to touch the flame to the
     flammable stuff.

                          peter
                     (stopping him.)
                hey hey hey...

                          manny
                is how we make loose the ticks back home.

     peter hesitates, but lets him go.  manny lights the polish.

     whoosh...the mimic's head is engulfed in a halo of flame. the
     legs loosen their grip.

     peter and manny yank it free from leonard, who's passed out
     from the pain.  his leg is torn and bloody.

                                                            cut to:
