                                                           fade in:

     the screen

     stygean darkness.

     wet clicking sounds. a beam of purplish ultra-violet light
     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... cockroaches. they skitter
     restlessly under the beam's intensity. series of shots -- the
     uv beam passing over various parts of the space. pipe webs,
     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. thousands of
     them.

     pull back to reveal
