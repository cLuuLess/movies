     int. museum - exhibit room - day

     a room of half-finished exhibits. a group of sculptors --
     most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece
     representing a termite mound.  they're supervised by siri, a
     punkish young indian research assistant.

     susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale
     clay model of an insect's head.  she gestures to the
     model's mandible set.

                          susan
                ...no, guys, these have to fit
                perfectly.  no spaces in between. let
                me tell you why. insects have no
                hands. all they have is this set of
                mandibles.

     she grabs the outer mandible set.

                          susan
                see?  this little piggy will grab the
                prey.

     then unfolds a second set...

                          susan
                then this little piggy will tear it
                in half...

     and a third!!!

                          susan
                ...and this little one will grind it
                to a pulp and push it in... all the
                way into the mouth.  these are
                precision tools here. can you
                remember that?

     the guys nod.

                          susan
                good.  then get it right.

     a piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,
     revealing...

     ...peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging
     sweats. he smiles at susan.

     exhibits

     peter and susan walk through.  peter pulls something from a
     knapsack.  a bottle of medicine marked: metallinin.

                          peter
                     (teasing)
                "baby in a bottle..."

     he gives it to susan.

                          susan
                don't tease.

     around them, workmen begin unloading crates of display stuff,
     as a man on a ladder tacks up an "architects of nature"
     banner. susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a
     honeycomb.  peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.

                          peter
                you know where they get this
                fertility stuff?  they extract it
                from the urine of menopausal italian
                nuns.

                          susan
                     (laughs)
                monks bottle their own wine. don't
                they?

     she gently touches her belly.

                          susan
                trust me. i've never been this late.
                never.

     she shakes the bottle.

                          susan
                if nun's pee is what it takes...

     peter's cellular rings from his knapsack. susan grabs a
     larvae model from a pile on the floor.

                          susan
                you were the one who ran around with
                ice in his underwear, don't forget
                that.

                          peter
                don't get kinky here...

     peter takes the call. susan cuts away the excess plastic on
     the lid around the honeycomb moldings. the larvae fits
     perfectly inside.

                          peter
                okay, meet me out front.
                     (to susan)
                i gotta go. josh's picking me up in five.
                see you tonight.

                          susan
                i'll be late.

     he kisses her and leaves. susan turns to siri and the group
     working on that sculpture.

                          susan
                siri, sandblast that thing. it looks
                like trump tower.  those mounds are
                supposed to be made of dirt and
                excretions...

                          siri
                     (a wicked smile)
                just like trump tower, then.
