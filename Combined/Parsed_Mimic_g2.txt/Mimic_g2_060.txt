     int. hospital - hallway near morgue

     an orderly (jeremy) argues with an emt.  their point of
     contention:  a small form lying on a stretcher.

                          jeremy
                take it out back and throw it in the
                friggin' dumpster!

                          emt
                not unless somebody signs for it.

     susan walks toward them, catches sight of the tiny form.

     her eyes go wide.

                          susan
                oh, my god.

     jeremy notices her.

                          jeremy
                hey, you can't...

                          susan
                what's your name?

                          jeremy
                jeremy...

                          susan
                okay, jeremy...go get dr. chris
                raymond, will you?

                          jeremy
                lady...

                          susan
                did you hear me?  get dr. raymond!
                now!!

     jeremy hesitates.  but if her tone wasn't enough, the
     stare she gives him certainly is.

                          jeremy
                okay.

     jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall.

     susan approaches the stretcher.

                          susan
                     (to emt)
                where'd you find it?

                          emt
                washed up at the filtration plant on
                bank street. some asshole there
                thought it was a baby. they called
                us.

     susan bends over it.  she covers her mouth and nose at
     the stench.

                          emt
                it's a lobster, right?

     but it's not.  what lies on the stretcher before them
     looks more like a demon from a brueghel painting.

     a three foot insect.  it's mephitic, pink-white body is
     rotten, falling apart.  the head's intact, with strange,
     large jaws thrown wide open. the chitin on one is half
     gone.

                                                            cut to:
