     ext. jogging path - central park - dawn

     peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the
     central park reservoir. a beautiful day dawns behind him; the
     windows of the beresford sparkle in the morning sun.

     peter outperforms most of the other runners in the track, his
     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. keeping his
     stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of old nuns.

                          peter
                excuse me, ladies...

     without slowing down, peter retakes the path and moves past
     them.
