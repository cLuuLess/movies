     int. cab

     susan ignores the yakking armenian driver as she scans
     the buildings and empty lots-

                          armenian driver
                avenue b... again! maybe you got
                wrong letter, uh?

     the cabbie looks up at a manhattan street map glued over
     his head on the roof of the cab.

                          susan
                keep going. we'll tell you when to
                stop...

                          peter
                maybe they lied to you.

                          susan
                even if they did... that's all we
                have, isn't it?

     the cab cruises past the tenement buildings, nondescript
     stores, junked cars and rubble-strewn lots. it stops
     before a traffic light.

     a leering homeless guy with a greasy rag and greasier
     cleaning solution approaches the windshield.

                          armenian
                no... oh, shit. get away, you turk!

     the homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield
     with his dirty rag. the driver sends him away.

     the light turns green.  the driver accelerates, turning
     on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by
     the guy.

     susan sees something.

                          susan
                pull over!

                          armenian driver
                what...?

     susan motions excitedly.  the driver pulls over. susan
     gets out.
