                this thing was the size of my fist,
                peter!! that's off the charts!

                          peter
                okay. so you lost a great specimen-

                          susan
                don't you get it? it's more than
                that.

     peter takes a bedsheet. susan helps him fold it.

                          susan
                you know why insects don't grow larger?
                because they don't have a complex
                respiratory system. what i saw did. it
                had lungs.

     peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  the two
     begin to fold it together.

                          susan
                evolution doesn't work that fast.
                something pushed that thing to take the
                leap. we need to find another specimen.

                          peter
                we?

     as they fold the sheet, they move closer together.

                          susan
                i did a ph test on its tarsal pads.

     the folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to
     face. susan finishes folding herself.

                          susan
                there's only two species who match the
                enzymes i found.  one's a leaf-cutter ant
                in the amazon...

     she has his full attention now.

                the other we released here two years ago.
