     int. lab - night - montage

     susan and siri, both wearing walkman headsets, deftly mount
     butterflies and other insects onto display boards for the
     exhibit. rain is blowing in through the half-open window.

     their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and
     designs of the insects are beautiful.

     we understand how you can get lost in this world.  susan
     works steadily, a partially-eaten pay-day bar and the
     wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner.

     a pager goes off in susan's lab coat.

     she takes off her headset; classical music leaks from her
     headphones.

     on the pager's lcd screen the message reads: late
     tonight. pete.

     susan puts the pager down. goes to close the window.

     there is a loud, angry buzzing sound.

                          susan
                siri?
                     (louder)
                siri?!

     siri pulls her headset off; heavy metal music leaks from her
     headphones.

     the buzzing sound again. we pan across the various bugs and
     mounting implements till we come to rest...

     ...on the shoebox the boys gave susan. something rattles
     wildly inside.

                          siri
                ...the fuck?

     susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. it
     vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves
     inside.

     she slowly opens the lid.

     the bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded
     newspaper. crumbs of bread and some rice-krispies can be
     spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's
     nest. she moves her free hand closer.

                          susan
                     (to siri)
                can you...?

     suddenly and insect big as her hand springs out of the
     shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! minute
     pieces of paper fly through the air!!

     susan slaps the lid back down.

                          susan
                     (a scared whisper)
                could you...help me...?

                                                            cut to:

     later

     siri comes over as susan grabs steel tongs and a cork
     dissecting board.

                          susan
                i'm gonna pull it out and i want you to
                pin it down, okay?

                          siri
                what is it?

                          susan
                i have no idea.  are you ready?

     siri nods, pins in hand.  susan opens the lid and grabs the
     nymph with the tongs.  the creature goes berserk, flailing
     its spindly limbs, buzzing and croaking, a milky substance
     foaming out of its body.

                          siri
                oh my god...

     susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard.

     siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the
     tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! a spider
     trapping a sparrow.

                          siri
                shit!! get it!  get it!

     snap!  it bites her hand between index and forefinger.

     susan pins the insect into the corkboard. it spins furiously,
     like a crazy lp record.

     susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs.  siri uses more
     pins to secure it down.

                          susan
                     (noticing siri's hand)
                it bit you.

                          siri
                no shit.

     susan

     leans to get a closer look at the nymph: deep dark brown,
     flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed.

     it squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh
     overhead light.

                          susan
                this wing configuration. i've
                never...

                          siri
                     (looking at her injury)
                fuck! it broke the skin...

                          susan
                and they're not fully developed.  this
                thing's not even an adult.

     the nymph continues to hiss and foam, struggling against the
     steel pins. susan looks closely at the insect's belly.

                          susan
                my god.

                          siri
                what?

     susan gestures to look.  siri stares down at

     the nymph's torso

     where a set of valves on its underside click in and out.

                          susan (os)
                it's breathing.

     siri

     shakes her head.

                          siri
                that's impossible.  insects don't...

                          susan
                i know.
                     (picks up a scalpel)
                help me get a sample.

     susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg.

     the nymph clicks nervously.

                          susan
                hold on, big guy, hold on...

     she traps the nymph down and cuts the leg off.

     a painful, agonized buzz echoes around the room.

                                                            cut to:

     monitor

     susan attaches the insect's leg to a samll holder. it is
     frozen in a swirl of dry ice.

     the brittle leg is then mounted in a laser microtome. bit by
     bit, the machine executes microscopic wafer cuts. siri is
     making slides out of each section.

     a series of microphotographic images flash onto the screen.
     in the background we hear the high-pitched buzz-

     we see the lights from the mounting room through a glass
     brick wall.
