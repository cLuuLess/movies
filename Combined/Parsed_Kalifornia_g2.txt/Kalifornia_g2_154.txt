                         ...they asked them just before they 
                         were executed why they did it. they 
                         said "to be famous."
                              (beat)
                         why do you do it?

               blinding him.

                                     early
                         do what bri?

               early moves slowly toward brian.

                                     brian
                         we both know you didn't have to kill 
                         that gas station attendant.

               brian's eyes dart nervously to the gun dangling in early's 
               palm. flash!
