               int. the den - same time

               mrs. musgrave is laid out on the couch. adele, deep in 
               thought, watches over the older woman. finally adele reaches 
               into her purse, pulls out her small potted cactus then walks 
               across the room to a table. its top is covered with small 
               potted cacti. she gently places hers among them.

               on mrs. musgrave

               mrs. musgrave begins to regain consciousness. her eyes open 
               to find... adele standing over her. adele brings her finger 
               to her lips -- shhhh.
