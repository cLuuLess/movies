               int. living room - same time (intercut with previous scene)

                                     brian
                         carrie, watch for early.

                                     carrie
                         what are you going to do?

                                     brian
                         i'm going to try and lift the end of 
                         the piano. if i can... slide your 
                         cuffs free.

               carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. brian presses 
               his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his 
               strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. 
               carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg.

                                     carrie
                         what about you?

                                     brian
                         i don't know.

               carrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. then she notices 
               a chair nearby.

                                     carrie
                         can you lift it again? just lift it, 
                         hurry.

               carrie grabs the chair. as brian lifts the piano, she pushes 
               the chair beneath the underside of it. it holds the piano 
               suspended an inch off the floor. brian drops to the floor 
               and slips the cuffs free.

               when... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden.

               a moment later, early steps quietly into the room. he's 
               pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. he sees 
               brian and carrie standing.

                                     early
                         you two been busy in here.

                                     brian
                         what happened to adele?

                                     early
                         well, let's put it this way.
                              (beat)
                         i need me a new woman.

               a shocked silence. brian and carrie look to one another. 
               carrie moves toward the kitchen but early stops her! brian 
               rushes at him. early sticks the .45 automatic in his face!

                                     early
                         sorry about this bri...

               he starts to squeeze the trigger.

                                     carrie
                              (desperate)
                         early, don't.

               early stops. he looks to carrie.

                                     carrie
                         i'll do whatever you want. you want 
                         me to go with you, i'll go with you. 
                         just don't kill him.

               early deliberates the situation, then eases up off the 
               trigger... and smiles to brian.

               then, without warning, he hits brian over the head with the 
               butt of the .45 automatic. brian falls to the floor 
               unconscious.
