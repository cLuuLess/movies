               int. 70's chevy - night

               a male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's 
               front window. the windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the 
               constant sheet of rain beyond.

                                     driver
                         damn! this defroster never works...

               the driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. 
               he finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. 
               the girl leans forward into the stream of warm air.

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         ...mmm... feels good.

               she closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. he watches 
               her. his eyes linger on her body.

                                     driver
                         have a problem with your car?

               she pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a 
               nervous smile.

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         no.
                              (beat)
                         my problem's with men.

               he throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway.
