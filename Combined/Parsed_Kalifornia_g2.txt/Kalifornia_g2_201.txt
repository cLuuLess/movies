               int. pickup truck - brian's pov

               the high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. 
               brian is still driving dangerously fast. the dim lights of 
               the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road 
               ahead and the swirling sand.

               he passes a road sign: 'devastation drive'

               then... as the pickup truck comes around a corner suddenly... 
               directly in front of him -- headlights!!

               brian reacts... too late!!

               the pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle, and tumbles end 
               over end through the open desert, before finally coming to 
               an abrupt halt.
