               brian and carrie are still cuffed to the piano. across from 
               them, early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through 
               carrie's collection of erotic photography.

                                     early
                              (to brian)
                         have you seen this one? that don't 
                         leave much to the imagination now 
                         does it?

               he looks at another photograph. confused, he turns it upside 
               down, stares at it.
