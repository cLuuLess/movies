               ext. lincoln

               brian and carrie walk back to the car.

                                     brian
                              (upset)
                         we could have been in and out of 
                         there in less than ten minutes...

                                     carrie
                         hey, i got some great stuff... it's 
                         okay.

               brian continues on in a huff until carrie breaks stride and 
               stops. she pulls him next to her.

                                     carrie
                         it's okay... okay?

               brian glances back at the house. she interrupts his glance, 
               kisses him.

                                     brian
                              (continuing on the 
                              heel of the kiss)
                         ...that house is part of american 
                         history now, whether he likes it or 
                         not.

               they enter the car.

                                     early
                         forget about it bri'. i wouldn't be 
                         surprised if that karma thing don't 
                         come back and get him.

               carrie, surprised at early's new found philosophical belief. 
               she looks into her side view mirror... and sees early smiling 
               back at her. carrie looks away...

               carrie's pov

               shifts from the mirror to the house in the background... as 
               the car pulls out of the driveway, the little girl watches 
               from her porch.
