               the attendant is reaching up, handing early the money from 
               his pockets. carrie is seated in front of him.

                                     early
                         where you from walter?

                                     attendant
                              (nervous shake)
                         vernon, florida.

                                     early
                         never heard of it, any huntin'?

                                     attendant
                         turkey mostly.

                                     early
                         turkey's are real smart. smarter 
                         than most people think...

               early rips the phone out of the wall.

                                     early
                         tell you what walter, you lie down 
                         there now... you make sure you stay 
                         put for a while after we leave... 
                         okay?

               the attendant nods yes.

                                     attendant
                         ...mind if i hold that bible?

                                     early
                         what do you need a bible for?

               the attendant has no response.

                                     early
                         you think i'm goin' to kill you. 
                         well that'd make me a liar then 
                         wouldn't it?

                                     attendant
                         no sir.

               early takes the bible off the desk and hands it down to the 
               attendant.

                                     early
                         here you go.

               the frightened young man lies face down on his stomach 
               clutching the bible and starts to pray.

               on the counter next to him early notices a large stuffed 
               "happy face" display. "free with every 20 gallon purchase."

               he grabs one, stares at its face curiously.

                                     early
                              (mumbles to himself)
                         i wonder if adele would like one of 
                         these?
                              (beat)
                         nah...

               suddenly... he puts the barrel of the gun between the "happy 
               face" eyes... points it at the back of the attendant's head.

               carrie begins to scream. early pulls the trigger.

               the blast explodes the "happy face" and rips into the back 
               of the attendant's head, killing him.
