               int. moving lincoln - morning

               brian behind the wheel, carrie riding shotgun. early and 
               adele are sitting in the back seat. an awkward silence 
               prevails. brian clears his throat.

                                     brian
                         uh, we can stop somewhere if you and 
                         adele haven't had time for breakfast, 
                         early.

                                     early
                         well, it's like this, mr. kessler.

                                     brian
                         brian.

                                     early
                         well, it's like this, bri'. i don't 
                         eat much in the mornin', never have. 
                         maybe a beer once in a while; lucky 
                         lager's my favorite.

               brian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious 
               about it.

                                     adele
                         it's because of what he read in a 
                         book once... that folks needin' 
                         breakfast is a myth, or whatever, 
                         put out by those cereal people.

               a glance passes between brian and carrie. is she for real?

               carrie's pov - in vanity mirror

               early motions adele not to talk so much.

               new angle

                                     brian
                         so what do you do early?

                                     early
                         oh... i do some work up at the merrick 
                         mirror factory, or i used to...

                                     adele
                         one night we figured out how much 
                         bad luck he must have comin' from 
                         all them mirrors he broke...
                              (beat)
                         four hundred and ninety four years 
                         to work it all off... after he dies, 
                         he'll have to keep coming back to 
                         earth over and over and over...

                                     carrie
                         karma.

               adele and early show no sign of understanding the word.

                                     adele
                         what?

                                     carrie
                         karma...
                              (beat)
                         you know, if you do something bad to 
                         somebody fate will pay you back by 
                         something bad happening to you.

                                     adele
                         that french ain't it?

               carrie glances at the odometer on the dash... the first mile 
               clicks over.
