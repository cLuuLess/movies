               int. lincoln

               carrie watches as brian and early carry their things to the 
               trunk. carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to 
               zero. when she sits back up, adele is standing at her window.

                                     adele
                         hi, i'm adele.

                                     carrie
                              (reserved)
                         carrie.

               she turns away from the window...

                                     adele
                              (shyly)
                         i like your hair.

               carrie turns back, rolls down window...

                                     carrie
                         ...pardon?

                                     adele
                         ...i said, i like your hair.

                                     carrie
                         ...thank you.

               she turns and sees early reflected in the side mirror watching 
               her. he grins at her, carrie looks away.

               new angle: from inside the trunk of the lincoln

               brian crams the last of the bags in, as early watches.

                                     brian
                         tight fit.

                                     early
                         best kind.

               brian looks to him, early grins and winks. brian slams the 
               lincoln trunk lid shut.
