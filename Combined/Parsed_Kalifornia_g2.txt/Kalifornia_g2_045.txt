               adele watches carrie, intrigued by the obvious skill carrie 
               shows with the camera. brian glances into the rear-view mirror 
               at adele.

                                     brian
                         so adele, did early happen to mention 
                         the places we'll be stopping at?

               on adele's reflection in mirror... then early leans in front 
               of her.

                                     early
                         yeah bri' i did.

               adele leans against carrie's front seat.

                                     adele
                              (to carrie)
                         are you takin' the pictures?

                                     carrie
                              (surprised)
                         ...yeah.

                                     adele
                         is it hard to learn?

                                     carrie
                         not really.

               early pulls adele back toward the back seat.

                                     early
                              (to brian)
                         you gonna talk to the people who did 
                         those murders?

                                     brian
                         that's a good idea. unfortunately 
                         most of them have been executed.

                                     early
                         ...too bad.
