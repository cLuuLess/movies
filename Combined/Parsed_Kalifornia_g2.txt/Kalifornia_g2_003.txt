               int. roofless old warehouse - night

               suddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! 
               revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. silhouetted briefly 
               against the paint chipped walls are two figures: a man, brian 
               kessler, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, 
               and a woman, carrie laughlin, 25, short black hair and tight 
               black clothes. carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical 
               cord runs to a strobe light. brian holds a flashlight in one 
               hand, a tape recorder in the other. he begins speaking into 
               the tape recorder.

                                     brian
                         her father worked the night shift 
                         here. most nights he'd bring her 
                         with him.
                              (pause)
                         she was eleven years old.

               his flashlight scans the ominous environment. carrie takes 
               flash photo.
