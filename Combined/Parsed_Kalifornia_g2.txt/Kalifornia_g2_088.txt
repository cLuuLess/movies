               brian walks to the front of the lincoln. he passes carrie 
               and adele...

                                     adele
                         early don't think women should smoke 
                         or curse or drink liquor.

                                     carrie
                         so you don't do any of those things.

               carrie takes a quick look to the mini-market. she's lost 
               sight of early.

                                     adele
                         better not, or early'd whip me.

                                     carrie
                              (back to adele)
                         he whips you?
