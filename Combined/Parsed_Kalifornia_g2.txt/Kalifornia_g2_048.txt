               ext. moving lincoln driving down country road

               close up, diebold's ring on a hand twisting open a bottle 
               cap. pull back to reveal that it is early as he opens a bottle 
               of lucky lager beer and takes a sip. on the back seat between 
               them sits a brown paper bag. adele reaches into the bag and 
               pulls out a cheap pocket camera. excitedly she rips open the 
               box and pulls out the camera. she leans over and kisses early.

                                     adele
                         thank you.

               early reaches in the bag and pulls out a small plastic bottle 
               of mineral water and an orange juice.

                                     early
                         all right, who gets the...
                              (can't pronounce name)
                         ...water.

               carrie turns around, early hands her the water. early leans 
               forward and hands brian the orange juice.

                                     early
                         here you go bri'. got a couple a 
                         bags of chips and some jerky, just 
                         holler if you want some.

               then early reaches past brian to the rear-view mirror and 
               hangs a plastic st. christopher statue around it.

                                     early
                         can't hurt.

                                     brian
                         how much do i owe you?

                                     early
                         forget it.

               adele struggles to understand the camera instructions on the 
               side of the box. she leans forward and shows carrie her 
               camera.

                                     adele
                              (embarrassed)
                         guess i don't know the first thing 
                         about cameras.

               carrie deliberates her response for a moment, then...

                                     carrie
                         well, the first thing... is you need 
                         film. preferably black and white.

               carrie pulls a roll of film out of her bag and takes adele's 
               camera to load.

                                     adele
                         you wouldn't have any color film, 
                         would ya?

                                     carrie
                         ...yeah, sure.

               she pulls a roll of color film out of her camera bag and 
               quickly snaps it into the camera.

                                     adele
                         i like things in color, pink, purple, 
                         and red. i dunno, black and white is 
                         kinda... boring.

               carrie points the camera at a smiling adele and snaps the 
               first picture.

                                     carrie
                         you just aim and press the button.

               adele takes the camera.
