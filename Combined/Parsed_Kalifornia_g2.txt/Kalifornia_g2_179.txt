               int. kitchen

               he steps outside and starts firing his gun into the 
               blackness... bullets thunk into the cacti.

                                     early
                              (shouting over the 
                              gunfire)
                         nobody wants to hurt you peaches!

                                     adele
                         early! stop!!

               desperate, adele grabs a large potted cactus. she rushes 
               toward early. swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat, she 
               pummels the side of his head. he stumbles forward, 
               disappearing into the darkness. adele stands outside the 
               kitchen door, bewildered. then...

                                     early (o.s.)
                         oww! oww!! -- fuck!!!!

               early re-emerges from the shadows. adele's eyes widen when 
               she sees him. his cheek has long bloody gashes where the 
               cactus ripped the flesh.

                                     early
                              (perplexed)
                         honey... what do you think you're 
                         doin'?

               adele starts to cry.

                                     early
                         oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 
                         'bout? i'm the one got hit.

                                     adele
                         i changed my mind, early. i'm not 
                         gonna climb up that hollywood sign 
                         with you... i decided. i think your 
                         mean, and you hurt people.

               a look comes over early's face that we've never seen before. 
               that he's never felt before. hurt. he doesn't know how to 
               deal with it. and he definitely doesn't like it.
