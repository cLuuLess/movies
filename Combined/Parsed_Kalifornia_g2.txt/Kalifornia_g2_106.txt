               int. lincoln driving down the road - daytime

               early is driving. brian riding shotgun, is making some notes 
               in his manuscript. adele is teaching a reluctant carrie to 
               play a card game called "snap."

                                     adele
                         ...hey you're good. thought you said 
                         you never played before?

                                     carrie
                         i haven't... i'm a fast learner.

               on early and brian

                                     early
                         ...they never caught that black dolya 
                         killer, huh?

                                     brian
                         dahlia, no.

                                     early
                         now why is that?

                                     brian
                         some people think it's because he 
                         never killed again. he just 
                         disappeared back into society.

                                     early
                         you don't sound too convinced 'bout 
                         that?

                                     brian
                         i always thought it was the work of 
                         a serial killer. anyone who took 
                         that much time and care bisecting 
                         another human being must have been 
                         enjoying it and would have done it 
                         again. and again. until someone 
                         stopped him.

                                     early
                         that your... "theory", ain't that 
                         what they call it?

                                     brian
                         yeah.

                                     early
                         you wanna hear mine?

               carrie listens in as she continues to play cards with adele.

                                     brian
                              (amused)
                         sure.

                                     early
                         ain't you goin' to record it?

               brian picks up his tape recorder.

                                     brian
                              (into tape)
                         early grayce, june twenty third.

               brian hands early the hand held tape recorder.

                                     early
                              (into tape)
                         well i'll just bet he's still alive. 
                         old, livin' in some trailer park or 
                         somethin' somewhere, but still alive. 
                         thinkin' every night 'bout what he 
                         done. goin' over and over it in his 
                         mind. how smart he was for getting 
                         away with it.

               carrie is chilled by the intensity of early's remark. she 
               watches him out of the corner of her eye. smack! adele's 
               hand hits the pile of cards and she wins the game. startled, 
               carrie turns back to adele.

                                     adele
                              (to carrie)
                         you lose!

                                     brian
                              (to early)
                         i suppose anything's possible.

               brian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his 
               notes.

               new angle: close up brian's shoe

               revealing... the blood encrusted toe of his shoe.

               new angle: cu on early

                                     early
                         you ever play any pool bri'?

               early's pov

               up ahead a honky tonk bar with a large sign "pool tables, 
               bowling & music"
