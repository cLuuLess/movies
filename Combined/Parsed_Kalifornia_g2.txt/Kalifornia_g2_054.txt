               brian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder.

                         the novaks are all gone but the fence 
                         that michael zaruba was hired to put 
                         up is still here.

               he glances to carrie, who fires off several photos of the 
               fence and yard.

               the lincoln continues slowly down the long drive... up ahead 
               through the windshield brian sees a beautiful old farm house.

                                     brian
                         the novaks embraced the young drifter 
                         as one of their own.
