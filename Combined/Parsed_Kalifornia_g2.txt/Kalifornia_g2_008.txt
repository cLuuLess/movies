               int. 70's chevy

               very close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper 
               is pulled open. the driver notices her opening the purse.

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         okay if i smoke?

                                     driver
                              (unconvincingly)
                         ...sure.

               the driver watches as she reaches into the purse... out a 
               soggy pack of matches. she looks at them... i look to the 
               driver.

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         my matches are all wet. you got a 
                         lighter?

                                     driver
                              (scans the dashboard)
                         yeah. it's here somewhere. it's my 
                         wife's car. ah... there it is.

               he pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat. out of the corner 
               of his eye, he sees the girl's hand slip back in her purse. 
               and stay there. she stares at the car lighter and... waits. 
               the driver glances at her, then back to the lighter.
