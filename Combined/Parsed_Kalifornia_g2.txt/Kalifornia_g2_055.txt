               ext. lincoln

               the lincoln slows to a halt. carrie and brian exit the car 
               and begin walking toward the house. early follows. adele, 
               uncertain about what's transpiring, trails behind.

                                     adele
                         hey you two.

               brian and carrie turn to see... adele training a camera on 
               them.

                                     adele
                         give me a smile now.

               brian and carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. 
               early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind 
               brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks.

               brian and carrie quickly turn their attention back on the 
               house.

                                     brian
                              (continues into tape 
                              recorder)
                         neighbors said he was a quiet young 
                         man, who was often seen pushing the 
                         children on the swing set.

               an unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. 
               to the side of the house are the remains of an old swing 
               set. carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, 
               with the house in the background, snap! she fires off a shot.

                                     brian
                              (continuing)
                         everything was fine until the day 
                         the family ran out of work for 
                         michael, and had to ask him to leave.

               as carrie frames up another shot, early crosses in front of 
               her camera. realizing he is in carrie's photo he stops and 
               poses. carrie looks to brian.

                                     brian
                         sorry, early... could you step out 
                         the way, for a second?

               early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. 
               he wanders away from the front of the house. meanwhile, adele 
               photographs the moment.

                                     brian
                         the first one to die was the nine 
                         year old daughter...

               just then... a nine year old girl comes running from around 
               the side of the house. she stops dead when she sees all of 
               them. carrie snaps a final photo.

                                     brian
                         hello.

               the little girl scans all their faces.

                                     brian
                         ...my name's brian, what's yours?

               the little girl remains silent. brian rolls a look to carrie 
               then back to the little girl.

                                     brian
                         ...could i speak to your parents?

               after an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the 
               yard to the porch and opens the front door.

                                     girl
                              (rudely)
                         pa! there's more of them.
