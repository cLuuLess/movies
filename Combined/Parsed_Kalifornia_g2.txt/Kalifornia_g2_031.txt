               ext. early's trailer - late that night

               adele steps out of the trailer.

                                     adele
                         early?

               she walks carefully around the junk piles. it's dark; hard 
               to see. she comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers 
               in... she can't see anything but hears the rustling of a 
               shovel digging.

                                     adele
                         early? you down there?

               the sound of digging stops.

                                     early
                              (from inside the hole)
                         what's up adele? dinner ready?

                                     adele
                         almost.

               after a moment's hesitation, early resumes his digging.

                                     adele
                         early...

               the digging stops again.

                                     adele
                         tell me more about california.

               the moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her.

                                     early
                         well... for one thing... they think 
                         faster out there, on account of all 
                         that warm weather they got; cold 
                         weather makes people stupid, that's 
                         a fact.

                                     adele
                         i guess that'd explain why there's 
                         so many stupid people around here.

                                     early
                         yeah, and in california you never 
                         have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on 
                         the trees everywhere you turn...
                              (beat)
                         ...and, 'course there ain't no speed 
                         limit out there, and all drugs are 
                         legal... and i heard your first 
                         month's rent is free; state law. i 
                         figure 'til we get settled we can 
                         just move around month to month...

                                     adele
                         what'll we do out there?

                                     early
                         well... the very first thing we're 
                         gonna do... is get us a couple of 
                         six packs of lucky lager and climb 
                         up on toppa' that famous hollywood 
                         sign and howl at the moon...

               early lets out a playful howl, as adele looks up over her 
               shoulder at the moon.

                                     adele
                         you know... i read once... ain't 
                         nothin' on that big old moon 'cept 
                         some old golf balls those astronauts 
                         left behind.

                                     early
                         bull. that ain't right... government 
                         sends people there all the time, 
                         just don't want us to know about it.

               adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer.

                                     adele
                         don't be long now, dinner's 'bout 
                         ready.

                                     early
                         i heard that.

               after a moment, early climbs out of the hole and stands in 
               the moonlight for a moment. we see that he's completely naked 
               except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. early 
               gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.
