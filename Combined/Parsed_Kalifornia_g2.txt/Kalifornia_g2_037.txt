               brian stops the lincoln and gets out. he approaches early 
               and shakes his hand, then adele's.

                                     brian
                         hi i'm brian... early, and you must 
                         be adele.

               an awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until 
               brian reaches for adele's bag.

                                     brian
                         let me help you.

               brian picks up her bag and carries it to the lincoln. adele 
               is instantly won over by the gesture -- early leery of it.
