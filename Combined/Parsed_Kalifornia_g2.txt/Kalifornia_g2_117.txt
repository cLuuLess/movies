               carrie is driving. brian is contending with a major hangover. 
               there is still a silent tension between brian and carrie 
               from the argument the night before. early is in the back 
               with adele. brian moves his head and moans.

                                     adele
                         my daddy always took sauerkraut juice 
                         and tobasco sauce for a hangover, 
                         mixed in one egg not two, and some 
                         tomato juice...

               from the front seat, brian's hand springs up in a desperate 
               plea for an end to adele's colorful description.

                                     brian
                         i'm okay, thanks.

               brian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car 
               pulls away.
