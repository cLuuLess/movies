               ext. desert

               sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked 
               pickup truck. brian is upside down with his eyes shut. a 
               trickle of blood runs down his face. camera booms up a dirt 
               slope to reveal the lincoln, beyond it on the hill above 
               sits the desert house. the glow of the kerosene lamp is 
               visible through the windows.

                                                                  fade out:
