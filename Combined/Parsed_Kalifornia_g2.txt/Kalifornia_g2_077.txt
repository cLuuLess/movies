               int. motel room - same time

               carrie turns back to the dresser and gathers up the last few 
               things. she glances into the dresser mirror looking for 
               early's reflection at the door, but he's gone. relieved, she 
               turns the corner to grab her bags and finds early standing 
               right there! looking at her. he startles her.

                                     early
                         i got 'em.

               he picks up her bags and walks out of the room. carrie watches 
               him, then she steps to the doorway.

                                     brian (o.s.)
                         all set?

                                     carrie
                              (startled)
                         fuck!

                                     brian
                         take your time.

               carrie looks back to early

               carrie's pov - ext. motel

               early places the bags in the lincoln's trunk. adele sees 
               early carrying carrie's bag, adele looks jealous.
