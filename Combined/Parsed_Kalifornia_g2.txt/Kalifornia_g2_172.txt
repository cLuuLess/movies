               ext. house - later

               early is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope.

                                     adele (o.s.)
                         early?

               he pulls his eye away as adele arrives.

                                     adele
                              (excited)
                         early, mrs. musgrave has the most 
                         beautiful little guest house out 
                         back and... well, no one's stayin' 
                         in it... it's just empty. and she 
                         said if me and you wanted to, well 
                         maybe we...

               suddenly, o.s., a scream pierces the moment!

               early and adele turn toward the doorway to see mrs. musgrave 
               screaming. the older woman's eyes staring past adele to the 
               floor nearby. adele follows the terrified woman's gaze to 
               find... mr. musgrave's body lying on the floor. a bloodied 
               wound in the back of his head. all of adele's enthusiasm 
               drains from her face.

                                     early
                              (to mrs. musgrave)
                         well 'peaches'... you're a widow 
                         now.

               mrs. musgrave collapses to the floor.
