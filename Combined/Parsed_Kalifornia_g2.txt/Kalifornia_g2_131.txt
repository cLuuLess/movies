               int. gas station

               the only person inside is a young male attendant. he's 
               watching tv behind the counter as carrie enters. on the tv 
               we see a newsman. we only catch fragments of what he is saying 
               because the storm outside is affecting the tv reception.

                                     carrie
                         twenty dollars in the tank and a 
                         carton of cigarettes.

               in fact, each time the lightning flashes occur all of the 
               electrical power at the station is affected. the fluorescent 
               lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter 
               sporadically.

                                     newsman
                         ...the ex-mental patient with a 
                         history of arrests is still at 
                         large...

               static.

               carrie looks at the tv, watches for a moment. it doesn't 
               hold her attention. she looks away and notices adele leaving 
               the car. adele walks toward a coke machine at the other end 
               of the gas station.

                                     attendant
                         here's your cigarettes...

               carrie turns back toward him.

                                     attendant
                         ...and change. better be careful, 
                         looks like a bad one coming. where 
                         you headin'?

                                     carrie
                         california.

                                     attendant
                         hear it never rains there. must be 
                         nice.

               he buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to 
               gas up the lincoln. carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from 
               the carton, nervously lights one up. she looks out the window 
               toward the lincoln.
