               int. 70's chevy - night

               flash!! an oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat 
               up chevy's windshield... revealing... the driver, 45ish, as 
               he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door.

               the pretty teenage girl slides into the car. dressed only in 
               a skirt and t-shirt, she's soaked to the skin. make-up runs 
               down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. she 
               seems nervous... scared even.

                                     pretty teenage girl
                         thanks.

               as she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has 
               been injured. it's bound with coarse white toweling and 
               stained with blood. in her other hand, she clings tightly to 
               a cheap yellow leather purse. he reaches forward and puts 
               his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing 
               against her leg, she moves away. he slides the gear-shift 
               into drive.

               another car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls 
               out into the night.
