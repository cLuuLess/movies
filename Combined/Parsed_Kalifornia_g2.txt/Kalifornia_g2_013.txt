               ext. freeway - night

               the chevy brakes... skids across the rain-slicked pavement 
               and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood.

               another angle: closer

               the camera drifts across the fractured front end of the 
               overturned chevy. the twisted hunk of metal hisses... 
               steams... groans. the front tire spins lazily to a halt on 
               its mangled axle.

               in the background - high overhead

               we see a man standing on a highway overpass. he's leaning on 
               the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.

               closer

               early grayce, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black 
               hair, stands by the railing. rain streaks down his 
               expressionless face. he dropped the rock.

               early's pov - the 70's chevy

               lying in the deserted highway. the driver crawls out covered 
               with blood. still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette 
               lighter. its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint 
               glow.

               angle: closer on early

               calmly looking down with no pity. even closer... water running 
               down his face. closer yet... on his eye... and right into 
               the dilated pupil.

               as we enter it -- it's like being in a dark winding tunnel 
               filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping 
               of powerful machinery.

               from somewhere in the blackness

               the distant echo of a woman's voice.

                                     kim (o.s.)
                         are you dead or alive?
