               int. moving lincoln - noon

               brian at wheel, carrie next to him loading her camera. early 
               in the back seat, adele next to him pulls out some make up 
               from her bag, we see the little cactus from the motel lobby. 
               she begins to put on some lipstick. early reaches into the 
               frontseat and grabs the manuscript that sits between brian 
               and carrie.

                                     early
                              (starts to read)
                         this the book your writing?

                                     brian
                         it's just a work in progress, kinda 
                         rough.

                                     early
                         this guy killed a mess of people.

                                     brian
                         who?

                                     early
                         henry lucas.

                                     brian
                         henry lee lucas. well he was only 
                         convicted of killing eleven but he 
                         claimed to have killed over three 
                         hundred.

                                     early
                         wonder what all them people done 
                         made him so mad?

               brian looks to early in his rear-view mirror.

               bang!!

               the front tire blows... the car lurches. brian reacts, pulling 
               the lincoln to the side of the road in a dusty halt.
