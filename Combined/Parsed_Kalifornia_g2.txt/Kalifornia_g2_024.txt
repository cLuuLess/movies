               int. early's trailer

               early spills through the doorway.

                                     early
                         adele, who's car's that out...

               early spots his parole officer standing in the bedroom area 
               snooping around. he has a prosthetic hand which he uses to 
               search through early's things.

                                     parole officer
                         she's not here.

               the parole officer hiccups throughout the scene.

                                     early
                         what are you doin' here? i ain't 
                         supposed to be at the parole office 
                         'til tomorrow, two o'clock.

               early notices the man looking through some of his letters 
               and papers.

                                     parole officer
                         social call.

               the parole officer opens one of the closet doors, pilfers 
               through things inside, as if searching for something. early 
               is getting pissed off but says nothing.

                                     parole officer
                         you're supposed to call me when you 
                         lose your job early. i stopped by 
                         the mirror factory today, you left 
                         quite a mess behind there.

                                     early
                         wasn't my fault...

               he lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger.

                                     early
                         ...it was dangerous there and they 
                         treated me like shit.

               parole officer steps over to the refrigerator, opens it, 
               snoops around inside.

                                     parole officer
                              (swallows a hiccup)
                         yeah... well you never have been 
                         'treated right'... have you?
                              (hiccup)
                         your father was pickin' on you when 
                         he threw you out of the house for 
                         stealing the tires off his truck. 
                         the marines misunderstood you when 
                         they gave you that dishonorable 
                         discharge.

               he finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search 
               through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer.

                                     parole officer
                              (hiccup)
                         ...the police were way out of line 
                         when they stopped you from beating 
                         that bartender half to death. and no 
                         doubt god'll be pickin' on you on 
                         judgement day...

                                     early
                         i ain't got nothing against god. 
                         it's the people he let come into the 
                         world... lot of them should have 
                         been stopped at the door. what are 
                         you looking for?

               the parole officer ignores the question. he steps up to a 
               sink overflowing with dirty dishes.

                                     parole officer
                         that girlfriend of yours ain't much 
                         for housekeeping, is she.

               early dismisses the place with a glance.

                                     early
                         i'm thinking about moving...

               early opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer.

                                     early
                         maybe down to texas... probably get 
                         some work on them offshore oil rigs. 
                         hear the pay's good... hell, the 
                         weather's got to be better'n here.

               early sits down at the table. the parole officer steps over 
               to him.

                                     parole officer
                         what are you talking about? you know 
                         you can't leave the state.
                              (hiccup)
                         what you can do is get a job.

               the parole officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt 
               pocket, sets it on the table.

                                     parole officer
                         you be at this personnel office, 
                         friday, three o'clock sharp.

                                     early
                         what is it?

                                     parole officer
                         ...janitor's job.

                                     early
                         oh man... come on, i don't want no 
                         janitor job.

               early lifts his beer for another drink. the parole officer's 
               prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer 
               bottle, just inches from early's lips.

                                     parole officer
                         hey, i don't give two shits about 
                         what you want or don't want... i'm 
                         telling you to be there friday, three 
                         o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be 
                         here for dinner. you understand?

               with that early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then 
               stands up. the parole officer hiccups again. early stares at 
               him for a moment.

                                     early
                         you oughta think about putting a bag 
                         over your head... might cure them 
                         hiccups.

               the parole officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out 
               of the trailer to his car.

               brian's desk in another part of loft apartment - night

               brian's in the midst of working his way through pages and 
               pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk. using 
               chopsticks he shovels chinese straight out of the carton as 
               he studies carrie's warehouse photographs.

               carrie's pov

               as we approach brian from behind, moving closer, closer.

               new angle - brian's desk

               carrie steps up behind him. she's rubbing her eyes, having 
               just awakened. a hangover beckons. brian notices her.

                                     brian
                         hey. i didn't have the heart to wake 
                         you.

                                     carrie
                         thanks. what are you doing?

                                     brian
                         well, i sat down with my tapes and 
                         your photographs, which are great by 
                         the way... and i started writing.

               carrie grabs his container of chinese and takes a few bites. 
               listens.

                                     carrie
                         so how's it going?

                                     brian
                         ...i think it's the best stuff i've 
                         done.

               carrie glances over his shoulder at his writing.

                                     brian
                         ...and i think i know why.

                                     carrie
                         why?

                                     brian
                         because i was there. and for a moment 
                         that night i understood how she came 
                         to pull the trigger.

                                     carrie
                              (sarcastic)
                         this mean your finally going to finish 
                         your thesis?

                                     brian
                         look, fuck the thesis. i think there's 
                         a book here. your photographs and my 
                         research, together.

                                     carrie
                         a book on the warehouse murders?

                                     brian
                         a book on some of the most infamous 
                         murderers in america. i want to go 
                         to where they lived and where they 
                         killed and i want you to photograph 
                         it.

               brian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the 
               united states up and lays it out on his desk. he traces a 
               route west. along the way, specific locations have been 
               circled.

                                     brian
                         what i'm thinking is, we can drop 
                         down through tennessee, across 
                         arkansas and into texas, from there 
                         it's a straight shot into california.
                              (pause)
                         "we don't stop... until we hit the 
                         fucking ocean."

               omitted

                                     carrie
                         it's about fucking time, kessler! 
                         i'd just about given up on you.

                                     brian
                         we don't have enough money, but we'll 
                         figure something out.

               carrie steps up to brian.

                                     brian
                         ...it's either the best idea i've 
                         had in a long time... or there's way 
                         too much msg in this stuff.

               brian looks at the container of chinese in his hand. carrie 
               takes it from him, sets it down on the road map. kisses him.
