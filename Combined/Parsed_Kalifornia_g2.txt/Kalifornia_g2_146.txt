               int. abandoned store

               adele enters the decrepit store. the others are inside. brian 
               and carrie are tied up. brian watches early intently as he 
               takes one of the bags from adele. he begins opening one of 
               the carry out containers.

                                     early
                         what the hell is this stuff?

                                     adele
                         it's chinese food. it was the only 
                         place open. you said you was starving, 
                         you'd eat anyth...

               early opens another container. stares curiously at the 
               contents.

                                     early
                         yeah but, what is it?

                                     adele
                         i don't know, they didn't speak too 
                         good english.

               early sets the container down.

                                     early
                         and just what exactly are the chinese 
                         doing here in the middle of the 
                         american desert anyway?... didja get 
                         the beer?

               adele somewhat reluctantly hands early a bottle of beer from 
               a second bag.

                                     early
                         ..."chink" beer!

               early notices that brian is watching him intently. he mistakes 
               brian's interest for hunger.

                                     early
                         oh hell, i'm sorry bri. adele, honey, 
                         untie brian, he's starving over there.
                              (pause)
                         carrie, you want some?

               carrie doesn't respond at all. adele unties brian.

               early pulls out his gun, puts it on the table next to him. 
               brian sits across from early. he watches as early rummages 
               impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia.

                                     early
                         where's the damn forks and spoons 
                         at!

               frustrated, early finally takes a gulp of chinese food right 
               out of the container. it goes down rough.

                                     early
                         ...is it just me, or has this whole 
                         trip been goin' downhill ever since 
                         we ran outta lucky lager?

               brian picks up a pair of chopsticks, then reconsiders, puts 
               them back down and, like early, gulps from the container.

               nearby, carrie sits quietly. as she listens to the two men 
               talk... she notices something on her arm. she lifts her arm 
               up to get a closer look.

               her pov

               she sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling 
               to her. closer... and she sees that one of the tiny feathers 
               is tinged with blood. the gas station attendant's. it freaks 
               her.

               on brian and early

                                     brian
                              (quietly)
                         how many people have you killed early?

               early stops... thinks for a moment.

               on carrie

               she tries to brush the bloodied feather away... but with her 
               hands bound, she can't reach it.

               on brian and early

                                     early
                         well now, how many people d'you see 
                         me kill?

               brian shakes his head.

                                     brian
                         none.

               on carrie

               in quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and 
               blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away.

               on brian and early

               early stares at brian.

                                     early
                         ...well then, that's how many i 
                         killed.

                                     brian
                              (unconvincingly)
                         if you say so.

                                     early
                         damn right i do.

               on adele

               adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor.

               on brian and early

               early picks up a different container and gulps some down. 
               after a moment...

                                     early
                         you never killed anyone have you 
                         bri'?

               brian shakes his head no.

                                     early
                         you never even seen anybody killed, 
                         right?

               brian stops eating and looks at early.

                                     brian
                         what are you getting at?

               early leans closer to him.

                                     early
                         you wanna tell me how'n the hell you 
                         gonna write a book 'bout somethin' 
                         you don't know nothin' 'bout?

               eye to eye, the two men stare at one another. brian has no 
               answer.

                                     early
                         ya see what i'm sayin'?
                              (beat)
                         ha!

                                     brian
                              (nervously mimes the 
                              same)
                         ...ha.

               early goes back to gulping down his dinner. this time he 
               gets a spicy one.

                                     early
                              (a nod toward the 
                              carry out container)
                         ...watch out for that stuff, it bites.

               brian gazes at the cluster of chinese carry-out food 
               containers. an ironic reminder of an earlier conversation. 
               he lets out a weak ironic laugh.

                                     brian
                              (recollecting to 
                              himself)
                         ...way too much msg.
