               int. roofless old warehouse

               brian's flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the 
               rafters and catwalks. scanning... listening... brian and 
               carrie glance tentatively at each other... then slowly carrie 
               lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing 
               into the rafters. carrie fires a shot, triggering a brilliant 
               flash!!

                                                                    cut to:

               flash! out of the inky black... the glistening wet rock 
               emerges, hurtling downwards... tumbling end over end through 
               the night rain...
