               ext. desert - later, the sun is on the horizon

               the winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. 
               the lincoln approaches on the fire road. a trail of steam is 
               streaming out from under the hood, blinding early's view.

               finally, early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to 
               a halt... steam pours out of the lincoln's grill. the lincoln 
               has had it.

               early is indifferent and looks around. about a hundred yards 
               away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 
               1950's style building.
