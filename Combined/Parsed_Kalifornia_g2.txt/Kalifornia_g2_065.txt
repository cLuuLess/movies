               int. motel restaurant - night

               a small roadside diner. a fair number of people inside having 
               dinner. adele, early, carrie, and brian are seated at one of 
               the tables.

               at their table

               carrie watches early eat with a kind of horrible, rude 
               fascination. he has no table manners at all. he eats with 
               his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right 
               hand. all the while, he chews with his mouth open. he's 
               serious about his "eating."

                                     brian
                              (studying his map)
                         well we've come three hundred miles 
                         so far. not a bad day's haul.

               early doesn't bother to respond. he keeps eating.

                                     brian
                         you got any family or friends in 
                         california, early?

               cu angle on early

               with a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate.

                                     early
                              (chewing)
                         nope... you?

               angle under the table

               early's foot itches... he tries to scratch it but it doesn't 
               do any good.

                                     brian (o.s.)
                         no.

                                     adele (o.s.)
                         me neither. how 'bout you carrie?

                                     carrie (o.s.)
                         no.

               angle - the group

               as brian folds up the map. early takes off his boot, then 
               his well-worn sock. carrie's look of disgust grows as early 
               brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he 
               eats. carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her.

                                     adele
                         ...well, least we got each other. 
                         that's somethin'.

               omitted

               omitted

               brian looks up, sees carrie's expression... then what's 
               causing it... early mops up the last bit of food on his plate. 
               he notices brian and carrie staring at him and slowly puts 
               his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock.

               brian picks up the check to see the total... starts pulling 
               his wallet out... isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab 
               to early.

                                     early
                         thanks bri', i'll get the next one.
                              (prompts adele)
                         think it's time we hit the sack.

               early winks at brian, carrie catches the wink. early and 
               adele get up and head for the door. adele waves goodnight.

                                     adele
                              (to carrie)
                         sweet dreams.
