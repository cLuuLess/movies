               int. '50's house - same time

               in the darkened bedroom, early's solitary figure rustles 
               atop the bed. slowly, he awakens. his eyes open. across the 
               bed, a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost. in 
               the other cuff is carrie's motionless hand.

               then, out of the corner of his eye, early sees something in 
               one of the nearby rooms. curious, he stands, shoves the .45 
               automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway.

               as he passes through the living room and enters the hallway, 
               his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment.

               early's pov

               a blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps 
               around the front door frame... it looks like a magical "door" 
               shrouded in a wall of light!

               on early

               in disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the "door"... and 
               sees through a window at the opposite end of the house... 
               the morning sun rising. with that he turns his attention 
               back to the front door!

                                     early
                         i knew there was doors out here!

               he walks toward the doorway of light. he grins as he opens 
               the "door" and steps through it. the sunlight momentarily 
               blinding him.

               early's pov

               a black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness... 
               eventually it blocks out all the light until... whaamm!!!!
