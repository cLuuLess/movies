               int. lincoln - a moment later

               the car moves down the highway. early in the back seat is 
               still trying to brush away feathers.

                                     early
                         hate to be an indian-giver but i'm 
                         gonna have to ask for my gun back.

               brian reaches in the glove compartment. he removes the gun 
               and hands it to early.

                                     brian
                              (to early)
                         what happened back there?

               carrie sits in the corner of the back seat, covered in 
               feathers but not even noticing them.

                                     carrie
                         he shot him in the head... oh god!

               adele turns to the back of the car to face carrie.

                                     adele
                              (raising her voice)
                         he did not, you liar. take that back.

               the lincoln swerves off onto the side of the road. adele 
               looks to the front again and steers it back onto the highway.

                                     carrie
                         he's a killer, brian... he's fucking 
                         insane.

                                     early
                         everybody just shut up!

               early picks some more feathers off himself.

                                     early
                         you two just cooperate and do what i 
                         say, and we'll all arrive safe and 
                         sound in california, as planned... 
                         unless, of course, adele don't kill 
                         us first with her driving.

               the st. christopher statue swings from the rear-view mirror. 
               the windshield wipers sweep back and forth against the pouring 
               rain.
