               int. lincoln driving down backroads - day

               early is behind the wheel, not a care in the world. adele 
               sits beside him playing with her camera. she turns and aims 
               the camera at brian and carrie in the back seat, their hands 
               are bound.

                                     adele
                         smile.

               neither makes any attempt at smiling. adele snaps their photo 
               anyway. in the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment 
               then leans over to early and whispers something to him.

                                     early
                         no way. i guarantee you he was 
                         breathing when i walked outta there.

               adele sits back quietly. carrie wants to speak but doesn't.

                                     early
                         hey... ain't we getting near the 
                         next murder site... bri?

                                     brian
                         forget about it, doesn't matter.

                                     early
                         hell it don't...
                              (beat)
                         ...hand me brian's map there adele. 
                         one day i'm gonna pass some store 
                         and see your book in the window. me 
                         and adele gonna buy a copy for our 
                         coffee table.

               new angle

               carrie silently fuming in the back seat. brian stares at the 
               rope that binds his wrists.
