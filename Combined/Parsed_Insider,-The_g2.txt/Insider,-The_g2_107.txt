     int. the courtroom, pascagoula, mississippi - day

     motley still conducting the inquiry...  and the tobacco
     lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce...

                         wigand
               that is correct.

                         motley
               in other words, it acts as a drug?

                         tobacco lawyer
               object to the form of the question!

                         motley
               it acts as a drug on the body?

                         tobacco lawyer
               object to the form!

                         motley
               it acts as a...

                         tobacco lawyer
               object!

                         motley
               there an echo in here?  your objection's
               been recorded.  she typed it into her
               little machine over there.  it's on the
               record.  so now i'll proceed with my
               deposition of my witness.  does it act as
               a drug?

                         tobacco lawyer
                   (shouts)
               dr. wigand.  i am instructing you...
                   (to wigand)
               ...not to answer that question in
               accordance to the terms of the
               contractual obligations undertaken by you
               not to disclose any information about
               your work at the brown & williamson
               tobacco company.  and in accordance with
               the force and effect of the temporary
               restraining order that has been entered
               against you to by the court in the state of
               kentucky!  that means you don't talk!
                   (beat)
               mr. motley, we have rights, here...

                         motley
                   (explodes)
               oh, you got rights and lefts!  ups and
               downs and middles!  so what?!  you don't
               get to instruct anything around here!
               this is not north carolina, not south
               carolina nor kentucky.  this is the
               sovereign state of mississippi's
               proceeding.  wipe that smirk off your
               face!  dr. wigand's deposition will be
               part of this record.  and i'm going to
               take my witness' testimony!  whether the
               hell you like it or not!
                   (to wigand)
               answer the question, dr...

                         wigand
                   (slams it home)
               yes.  it produces a physiological
               response, which meets the definition of a
               drug!  nicotine is associated with
               impact, with satisfaction.  it has a
               pharmacological effect that crosses the
               blood-brain barrier intact...

                         motley
               thank you, doctor.  thank you.
