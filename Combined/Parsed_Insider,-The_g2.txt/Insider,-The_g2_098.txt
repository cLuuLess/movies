     ext. richard scruggs' house, pascagoula, mississippi - day

     a white, traditional, southern house, with a veranda and
     gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.  and we see
     lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider,
     waiting alone on the expansive lawn.  the front door opens.
     a mississippi state trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat
     comes out and crosses the driveway.  then jeffrey coming out
     with motley.  motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment
     and then heads towards his car.  meanwhile, jeffrey comes
     down over to lowell on the lawn.

     and jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at
     the gulf.  and we see the street is blockaded by mississippi
     state police cars.  an armed camp.  other men in suits,
     lawyers and state officials, wait.  ron motley gets in his
     car and drives away.

                         lowell
               you attract a crowd.

                         wigand
                   (smiles, wry)
               yeah, great.

                         lowell
               i heard about the kentucky gag order...

                         wigand
               i don't know what to do.

     and they're quiet, a breeze of the gulf ruffling their
     coats...  he looks out at the water, a cargo container ship
     passing by.  he watches its slow progress...

     and jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands
     in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  and
     richard scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside
     lowell...
