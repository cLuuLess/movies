                         lowell
               how does he know he doesn't want to talk
               to me?  he doesn't know what i'm calling
               him about...

                         liane's voice (over)
               he doesn't care to know.

     and she hangs up.  lowell's motionless...  and his interest
     piqued, he sets down his cleaning.  he calls back...  the
     phone rings and rings...  a machine picks it up...  jeffrey
     wigand's voice:  "this is the wigands'...  if you'd like to
     leave a message or send a fax, start now..."
