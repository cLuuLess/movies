                   (interrupts)
               i'm telling you, your agents in that
               office are acting improperly!  now, who
               are they trying to protect?

     and we see a man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man
     who prides himself on his appearance, at his desk in the
     bureau (fbi).  bill robertson.  he's completely distracted,
     focused on agent travel orders...

                         bill robertson's voice (over)
               let me tell you something, lowell.  look,
               look, look.  you're talking about two
               agents in a regional office in
               louisville.  i got the goddamn unabomber
               threatening to blow up lax!  i gotta move
               45 agents from all over the country into
               l.a.  alright?  when i get a chance, i'll
               give it a look...

                         lowell
                   (heated)
               you better take a good look!  because i'm
               getting two things:  pissed off and
               curious!  now, any of these guys been
               offered jobs in corporate security after
               they retire?  either one of those guys
               have ex-agent pals already in those jobs?
               like, for instance, their ex-supervisor,
               who's already at brown & williamson as we
               fucking speak?
