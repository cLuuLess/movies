     int. a high school science class, louisville - afternoon

     not too many kids paying attention.  meanwhile, jeffrey has
     written his name on the blackboard.

                         wigand
               hi.

                         kids
                   (in unison)
               hi.

                         wigand
               my name is jeff wigand.  you can call me
               mr. wigand; you can call me dr. wigand--i
               have a ph.d. in biochemistry and
               endocrinology; you can call me jeff...
                   (beat)
               anything else you want to call
               me...you'll have to do so in private...
                   (a few kids smile)
               okay...  i find chemistry to be magical.
               i find it an adventure.  an exploration
               into the building blocks of our physical
               universe...
                   (beat)
               so, how many of you have taken chemistry
               before?

     nobody raises their hands.

                         wigand (cont'd)
                   (easy smile)
               okay...i've never taught it before, so
               we're gonna be fine.

     a couple of laughs...  and we feel jeffrey, for the first
     time is in a milieu that suits him.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               our first experiment is...
                   (holds up cigarette lighter)
               ...going to be measuring the molecular
               weight of butane...
