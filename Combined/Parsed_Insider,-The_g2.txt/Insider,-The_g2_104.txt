     ext. the courthouse, pascagoula, mississippi - day

     some of the tobacco lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging
     across canty street by their cars.  and now they see the
     police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards
     the courthouse.  the caravan stops.  first, scruggs gets out.
     a moment, then jeffrey appears.  and the reporters pounce on
     jeffrey, cameras flashing...mississippi police leading him
     through the crowd...  moore appears at courtroom door
     (already there).  and as he's whisked away into the
     courtroom.
