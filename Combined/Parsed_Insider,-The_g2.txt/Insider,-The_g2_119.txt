     int. a hotel room, louisville - night

     and we see wigand looking rough, unshaven, sitting on a couch
     in a hotel room.  and we see his belongings, clothing, some
     boxes, a bottle of vodka, his computer, what's left of his
     world, are around the room.

               okay?

                         wigand
               there is - there is no family.

                         lowell's voice (over)
               what do you mean there is no family?
