     int. the louisville airport - day

     we see jeffrey and his security man.  he passes a small
     filipino woman in a nurse's uniform and a man in clerical
     garb, who hands him a small american flag, asking for
     donations.  and, now, he passes through the metal detector.
     he nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind
     every so often to see if anybody is following him.  as he
     passes gate 3, he hears over his shoulder...

                         the man
                   (friendly)
               jeff...?

     jeffrey turns and the man throws a sheaf of subpoenas at his
     chest...

                         the man (cont'd)
                   (nasty)
               you've been served.

     and he turns and walks off.  and as jeffrey looks down at the
     subpoenas...
