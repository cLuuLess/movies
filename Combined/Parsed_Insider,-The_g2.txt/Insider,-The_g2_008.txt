     int. the wigands' house, foyer - day

     jeffrey comes in and a young girl, six, is watching
     television in the den...barbara.

                         wigand
               hi, honey.

                         barbara
               hi, daddy.

                         wigand
               what's new?

                         barbara
               ms. laufer gave me a star today.

                         wigand
               yeah?  what for?

                         barbara
               for reading.

     he pours himself a drink at a wet bar.

                         wigand
               that's great...  little early for
               cartoons, isn't it?

                         barbara
               okay.

     dutiful, she shuts off the tv, going upstairs.

                         barbara (cont'd)
               deborah?  debbie?

     he looks outside.  a woman is sitting on the back porch
     drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
     there's something like a hockney painting about her against
     the manicured lawns.  right now the woman comes in.  she's
     pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to
     wear on your arm.  liane wigand.  she has an odd delay
     between a thought and her speech...

                         liane
               oh, i didn't know you were home...  it's
               early...  isn't it?

     he doesn't say anything...

                         liane (cont'd)
               gotta take debbie to ballet...

     and it all feels suburban, familiar.  suddenly there's a
     shout...

                         barbara's voice (over)
               mommy!

     jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...
