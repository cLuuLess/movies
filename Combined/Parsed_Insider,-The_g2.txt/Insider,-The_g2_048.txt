     int. wigand's car - wide frontal - day

     jeff's car in the field, the giant colgate-palmolive clock
     behind.  the rain stopped.  steam rises from the weed strewn
     empty lot.  lowell's in the front seat.  and we get the
     feeling they've been talking for hours...

                         lowell's voice (over)
               just give me an example...

                         wigand
               for example.  james burke, the ceo of
               johnson & johnson...when he found out
               that some lunatic had put poison in
               tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the
               fda...  he didn't even wait for the fda
               to tell him.  he just pulled tylenol off
               every shelf of every store right across
               america.  instantly.  and then he
               developed the safety cap...  because,
               look, as a ceo, sure, he's gotta be a
               great businessman, right?  but he's also
               a man of science.  he's not going to
               allow his company...to put on the
               shelf...a product that might hurt people.
                   (sarcastic)
               not like the seven dwarfs...

                         lowell
               seven dwarfs?

                         wigand
               the seven ceos of big tobacco...they got
               up in front of congress that time...it
               was on television...

                         lowell
               ...and swore under oath that they know
               nothing about addiction, disease...

                         wigand
               it was on c-span.  yeah.

                         lowell
               okay, so, here you are...you go to work
               for tobacco.
                   (after beat)
               you come from corporate cultures where
               research, really, creative thinking,
               these are core values.  you go to
               tobacco...  tobacco is a sales culture.
               market and sell enormous volume.  go to a
               lot of golf tournaments.  the hell with
               everything else.
                   (beat)
               what are you doing?  why are you working
               for "tobacco" in the first place?

                         wigand
                   (deadly honest)
               i can't talk about it.  the work i was
               supposed to do...might have had some
               positive effect.  i don't know...it could
               have been beneficial.
                   (bitterness there)
               mostly, i got paid a lot.  i took the
               money.  my wife was happy.  my kids had
               good medical.  good schools.  got a
               great house.
                   (simply)
               i mean, what the hell is wrong with
               that...?

     he looks at lowell, as if needing validation...

                         lowell
               nothing's wrong with that.  that's it;
               you're making money...you're providing
               for your family?  what could be wrong
               with that?

     it's quiet.  after some moments...

                         wigand
               i've always thought of myself...as a man
               of science.  that's what's wrong with it.

                         lowell
               then...you're in a state of conflict,
               jeff.

     jeffrey doesn't say anything.

                         lowell (cont'd)
               because, look, here's how it lays out: if
               you got vital, insider stuff the american
               people for their welfare really do need
               to know...and you feel impelled to
               disclose it and violate your agreement in
               doing so, that's one thing.  on the other
               hand, if you want to honor this
               agreement, then that's simple.  you do
               so.  you say nothing.  you do nothing.
               there's only one guy who can figure that
               out for you.  and that's you.  all by
               yourself.

     lowell's evenhanded...is it too evenhanded?  as wigand
     contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  then
     wigand sees the time...

                         wigand
               i've got to go pick up the girls.  they
               only had half a day...

     lowell nods.  jeffrey starts the car.  the windshield wipers
     screech on a dry window.  their eyes meet.  as they drive
     off...we hold on the colgate-palmolive clock.
