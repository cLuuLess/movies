     ext. the wigands' house - evening

     she opens jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup
     holders.  she turns to leave and sees the backseat filled
     with two boxes and the books we saw him take...

                         liane
               uh, what are those boxes?

                         wigand
               i'm going to the store.  you need
               anything?

                         liane
               what do you need at the store?

                         wigand
               soy sauce...

                         liane
               right now?

                         wigand
                   (meaning in the car)
               that's my stuff from the office...

                         liane
               why did you take your stuff from the
               office?

                         wigand
                   (simply)
               i didn't want to leave it there...

                         liane
                    (confused)
               i don't understand.

                         wigand
                   (matter of fact)
               i got fired this morning...  where else
               am i gonna take it?

                         liane
               why?  who said?

                         wigand
                   (specifically)
               thomas sandefur...

                         liane
                   (stunned, fearful)
               what are we supposed to do...?  what
               about our medical coverage; what about
               our health?  what about our car payments?
               the payments on this house?

     he looks at her.  there's an unspoken moment when it seems
     he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  but she
     doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...

                         wigand
                   (a beat, specific)
               there's a severance agreement...  it
               includes cash payouts over time and
               continuing medical coverage...
                   (beat)
               sure you don't need anything?

                         liane
               no, thank you.

     she's stunned.  he leaves.  and as liane's completely still,
     her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she
     wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns
     into camera towards him to do that.  but he's driven off down
     the street.

                         liane (cont'd)
               jeffrey...!
