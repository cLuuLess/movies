     ext. scruggs' house, dock - day

     jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  trying to
     decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  a
     moment.  he turns, crossing to lowell and scruggs.  then.
     it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  time seems to
     slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally
     and historically...

                         wigand
                   (severely conflicted)
               i can't seem to find...the criteria to
               decide.  it's too big a decision to make
               without being resolved...in my own mind.

     they're quiet.  jeffrey, getting nowhere.  lowell offers...

                         lowell
               maybe things have changed...

     long pause on jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  and
     something just got resolved.  he asks lowell, rhetorically...

                         wigand
               what's changed?

                         lowell
                   (unsure)
               you mean...since this morning?

                         wigand
               no.  i mean since whenever...

     nothing's changed.  wigand looks at them.  he found his own
     answer.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               fuck it.  let's go to court.

     and dick scruggs and lowell look at this normal, somewhat
     flawed, very courageous man...

                         richard scruggs
                   (to unseen staff)
               dr. wigand would like to leave now.

     and there's a sudden flurry of activity.  jeffrey and scruggs
     walk to a mississippi state police car.  lowell gets into his
     car and drives away, separately.  police, state officials,
     run to their cars.  cars starting, lights flashing, wigand's
     car pulls into position.
