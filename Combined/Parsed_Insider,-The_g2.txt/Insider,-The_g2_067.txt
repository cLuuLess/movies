     int.  their bedroom - late night

     and past liane's sleeping form down the hall into the living
     room is her husband, his back to her, sitting in the
     trapezoid of light.  and as we dolly along her side, we come
     upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her
     eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction
     to his raging on the phone.  she's far from "okay."
