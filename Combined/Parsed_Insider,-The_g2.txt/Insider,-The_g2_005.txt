     int. jeffrey wigand's office - day

     the office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing,
     their lips moving.  his hair not yet settled on grey, his
     face is changing, always interesting.  born in the bronx,
     educated in upstate new york, he retains little of the accent
     and much of the directness.  he's jeffrey wigand.  he turns
     to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical
     books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his
     briefcase.  and as he leaves the office, the silent party
     like a bizarre mime behind him...
