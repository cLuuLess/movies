     int. bar - night

     close on lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports
     writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  he comes upon a
     rugged-featured man, jim cooper from the new york times,
     sitting next to charlie.

                         jim cooper
               hey, lowell.

                         lowell
               how are you, jim?

                         jim cooper
               hey, listen, i hear you guys are sitting
               on something sensational over there.

     lowell looks at cooper quizzically.

                         lowell
               really?  hi, joan.

     just then jim's wife enters.  they exchange greetings.

                         jim cooper
               hi, baby.

                         lowell
               catch you later.

     cooper and his wife leave.  charlie and lowell are alone in
     the crowded bar.

                         lowell (cont'd)
               when's your deadline?

                         charlie phillips
               monday.

                         lowell
               push it.

                         charlie phillips
               what?  forget it.

                         lowell
               it's a smear campaign, charlie.

                         charlie phillips
               it's drawn from a selectively
               circulated...

                         lowell
                   (cuts in)
               oh, it's real selective...about as hard
               to get a hold of as the manhattan phone
               book.

                         charlie phillips
               well, it's authoritative and is
               overwhelmingly documented.

                         lowell
               and it's bullshit.  and if i'm right, are
               you going to put the journal's reputation
               behind a story that's going to blow up in
               your face?

                         charlie phillips
               i'll take a look at what you got.  but i'm
               not moving any deadlines 'cause you say
               so.

     that's the way it lays.  in a different, personal tone...

                         charlie phillips (cont'd)
               are you all right?

                         lowell
               yeah.  catch you later.
