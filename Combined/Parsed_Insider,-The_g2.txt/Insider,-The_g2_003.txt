     int. a house in lebanon - day

     a round-faced man in his mid-forties, with large-framed
     glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a
     dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...
     it's the sheikh fadlallah whose face stares out at us from
     walls.  a gunman cradling an ak-47 sits in an incongruous
     purple armchair in a corner.  a torn poster of the seychelles
     is on one wall.  another gunman stands by a window.  lowell
     is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...

                         the sheikh
               coffee?

                         lowell
               yeah...  thank you.

                         the sheikh
               how have you liked your stay?

                         lowell
                   (droll)
               what i've seen...i've liked.

     the sheikh smiles.  and the smile passes as quickly as it
     came.  a steaming cup of coffee in a small arabic demitasse
     is put down.

                         the sheikh
               please to explain, why i should agree to
               interview...with pro-zionist american
               media?

                         lowell
               because i think hezbollah is trying to
               broaden into a political party right now.
               so you care about what you're thought of
               in america.  and in america, at this
               moment in time, hezbollah does not have a
               face.
                   (confident)
               that's why.

     and we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come
     here voluntarily.

                         the sheikh
               perhaps you prove journalism objectivity
               and i see the questions first.  then i
               decide if i grant the interview.

                         lowell
                   (blunt)
               no.  we don't do that.
                   (beat)
               you've seen "60 minutes" and mike
               wallace.  so you know our reputation for
               integrity and objectivity.  you also know
               we are the highest-rated, most-respected,
               tv-magazine news show in america.

     the sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying
     him.  and lowell "closes":

                         lowell (cont'd)
               so.  mr. wallace.  should he get on a
               plane or not?

     the sheikh thinks it over and then...

                         the sheikh
               tell him i will see him day after
               tomorrow.

                         lowell
               that's good.  that works.
                   (after a beat)
               uh, you know, i want to ask you
               something...i know it sounds odd...but...

     it's quiet...too quiet...

                         lowell (cont'd)
               hello, sheikh...?
                   (no answer)
               hello, sheikh...?

     silence.  he hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  he
     lifts it.  and he sees the sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.
     the house empty.  only his cameraman, the lanky man, left
     there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...

                         lowell (cont'd)
               norman.

                         norman
               what?  what?

                         lowell
               take your blindfold off.

     the lanky man does and we see the cameraman is asian-
     american.

                         lowell (cont'd)
                   (sarcastic)
               welcome to the world.

     norman gives lowell an ironic look and tests the local
     current at an electrical outlet.

                         norman
               fluctuating all over the place.  anywhere
               we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable
               gennies and we'll run cable...

     lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding
     height.  baalbek and the beqa'a valley below gold-domed
     mosques.  a moment of triumph.  he dials his cell phone...

                         mike wallace's voice (over)
               hello?

                         lowell
                   (into phone)
               mike, it's me.  we're on...

     and we hear people laughing and encouraging "go ahead...
     open it..."
