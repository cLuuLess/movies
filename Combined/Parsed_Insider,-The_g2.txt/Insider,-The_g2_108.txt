     ext. the scruggs' house, pascagoula, mississippi - night

     lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.  there's
     a slight sound.  he turns.  and jeffrey's come outside.  he
     stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain
     and windswept trees.  they're quiet.  they share a look.
     they nod to each other.  the smallest nod of accomplishment.
     and they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in
     pascagoula, mississippi.
