     int. the kitchen, the wigands' house - night

     we see out the window a security guard, incongruous, walking
     by.  and we see liane, finished with the dinner dishes,
     silently wiping off the sink.  there's a pall you could cut
     with a knife.  a moment, and jeffrey comes in the kitchen
     door from the garden...  he stops to wash his hands in the
     sink.

                         liane
               please don't wash your hands in the sink.

                         wigand
               where should i wash them?

                         liane
               use the bathroom.

                         wigand
               what's the difference...

                         liane
               that's for food.

     but he ignores her, washing his hands...  and she turns the
     water off.  he turns it back on.  he thinks, then turns it
     off.  then she turns it on.

                         liane (cont'd)
               leave it on!  just leave it on, okay?!

     and she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger
     repressed.  for jeffrey, everything else and now this?  the
     running faucet.
