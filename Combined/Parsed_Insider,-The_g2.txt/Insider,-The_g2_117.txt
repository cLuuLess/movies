     ext. lowell's house, berkeley - afternoon

     we see sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard...
     she turns, seeing him standing behind her...

     after a moment.  she knows.

                         sharon
               what's wrong?

                         lowell

                         lowell
               they're pretending it's process.
               bullshit, it's foregone.
