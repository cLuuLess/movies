     int. a cbs editing suite, new york - day

     and we see we're watching footage in an on-line editing bay
     from what we will learn is lowell's "n.o.p.d. blue" on police
     corruption in new orleans.

     lowell, tony baldo (his editor), debbie and an intense young
     man wearing glasses, an intern, looking at the cut.  all the
     police are on horseback, lots of cops on horses.
     lowell is waiting for a call to go through...

                         lowell
               the stringer was supposed to be shooting
               b-roll on street cops in new orleans.
               what's with all the horses?

                         tony baldo
               camera guy's got a thing about mounted
               police.

                   (re:  horses)
               don't any of these guys ride in cars or
               walk?

                         tony baldo
               how long did he stay on this?

                         lowell
               what was he seeing?

                         debbie deluca
