     int. wigands' house - night

     the house is quiet, dark.  too quiet.  too dark.  something
     isn't right.  he crosses to one of the children's rooms...the
     master bedroom.  the lights are on.  both rooms are empty.
     he goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for
     him...  he opens it.  he sits heavily in a chair, reading the
     note.  the security guard peers...  and as jeffrey sits in
     the silent house, the hero come home...
