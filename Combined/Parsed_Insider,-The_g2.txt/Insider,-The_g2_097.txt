     int. richard scruggs' kitchen - 7:00 a.m.

     jeffrey is sitting with scruggs and motley in scruggs'
     kitchen around a semi-circular counter.  coffee and sweet
     rolls.  it's casual.  no one's dressed for court.  scruggs
     has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas.  about
     motley, we sense power held in reserve.

                         richard scruggs
               now, what this one is, is a temporary
               restraining order, a gag order, issued by
               a kentucky court.

     meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a
     tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on
     the arm of a chair.

                         richard scruggs (cont'd)
                   (introducing)
               jeff wigand, michael moore.

                         michael moore
               good to meet you, dr. wigand.

                         richard scruggs
               mike's our attorney general down here.
                   (to moore)
               i was just explaining to jeff, they got a
               kentucky court to issue a gag order to
               stop his deposition today.

                         michael moore
               right.

                         richard scruggs
               now, they tried to get the mississippi
               court to honor it, but the judge threw it
               out...
                   (to jeffrey)
               however, for you, there is a more
               perilous effect to the kentucky gag
               order...

                         michael moore
                   (after a beat)
               dr. wigand, you do understand what could
               happen, don't you?

                         wigand
               i'm not free to testify...here...?

                         motley
               that's right.  if you violate the
               kentucky order, when you step foot back
               in kentucky, they can find you in
               contempt and they can incarcerate you.
               and you ought to know that.

     and jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he
     might go to jail...

                         wigand
               jail?

                         richard scruggs
               possibly, yes.  that is one of the
               possible consequences of your testifying
               here today.  that's right...

                         wigand
               how does one..."go...to...jail?"  what
               does my family do?  go on welfare?  if my
               wife has to work?  who's going to look
               after the kids?  put food on the table?
               my children need me.  if i'm not
               teaching...there's no medical...no
               medical...even on co-pay, that's like...
               tuition...

                         michael moore
               dr. wigand, listen, you may not be able
               to do this thing.  as i understand from
               dick, you're our key witness.  and, i
               hope you don't withdraw.  i guess we'd
               all understand if you did...
                   (at watch)
               guys, i've got to go.  i'm gonna be late
               for court.  i'll see y'all a little
               later.  dr. wigand, good luck.

     he leaves.  and jeffrey's quiet, frightened.  having shaken
     the departing moore's hand, he now turns away from scruggs
     and motley, thinking about consequences.

                         richard scruggs
               i know what you're facing, jeff.  and, i
               think i know how you're feeling...

     jeffrey's skeptical anybody could know "how it is"...

                         richard scruggs (cont'd)
                   (low, personal)
               in the navy i flew a-6's off carriers...
               in combat, events have a duration of
               seconds, sometimes minutes...  but what
               you're going through goes on day in and
               day out.  whether you're ready for it or
               not, week in, week out...  month after
               month after month.  whether you're up or
               whether you're down.  you're assaulted
               psychologically.  you're assaulted
               financially, which is its own special
               kind of violence.  because it's directed
               at your kids...what school can you
               afford...  how will that affect their
               lives.  you're asking yourself:  will that
               limit what they may become?  you feel
               your whole family's future's
               compromised...held hostage...
                   (after a beat)
               i do know how it is.
