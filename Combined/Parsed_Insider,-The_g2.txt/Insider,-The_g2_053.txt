     ext. the wigands' new house, the backyard - day

     jeffrey with the girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in
     the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small
     tomato trellises.  we see the house, now.  it's a small, one
     story.  deborah sees her mom and waves.  it's an image from
     the 1950's post-war boom.  liane waves back from behind the
     pane of glass...
