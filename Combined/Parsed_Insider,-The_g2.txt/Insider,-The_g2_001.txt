     int. a jeep, lebanon - day

     and we're in a speeding soviet jeep...  two men in front,
     shouldering assault rifles.  hezbollah soldiers...  and there
     are three men in the back.  a middle-aged man wearing a tired
     suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  and on either
     side of him, two men, blindfolded.  the man on one side is in
     his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled
     black-leather jacket...  a stocky man, with the edge of a
     j.d. salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.
     but even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here,
     turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of arabic music
     that disappears behind him...  he's lowell bergman.  on the
     other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky man with a
     voltmeter around his neck, norman.
