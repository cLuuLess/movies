     int. a house in san francisco - night

     a townhouse with a commanding view of the bay.  and we see a
     broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on
     the phone.  jack palladino.  his wife, sandra sutherland,
     sitting across from him on another phone.  they're private
     investigators...

                         lowell
               to make it even a little more attractive,
               i don't know if you're ever gonna get
               paid.

                         sandra sutherland
               is there any truth to any of it?

                         lowell
               that's a good question.  "is there any
               truth to any of it?"  i doubt it.

                         palladino
               what's their deadline?

                         lowell
               soon.

     palladinos exchange looks; she nods.

                         palladino
               fax me the summary.

                         lowell
               that's great, jack.

     lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter...
