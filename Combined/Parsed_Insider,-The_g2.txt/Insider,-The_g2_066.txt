     int. wigands' house, louisville - late night

     and jeffrey's emotions are back in check as...

                         wigand
               well, no, look...i mean, there was a
               footprint.  forget it.  it's probably not
               important at all.
                   (beat)
               you know, i got a job now.  i'm teaching
               high school. japanese and chemistry.
                   (beat)
               so, what were you calling about?

                         lowell's voice (over)
               you called me.

     he takes another drink...

                         wigand
               no, you said you were going to call me
               tomorrow.  so, what about?

                         lowell
                   (after a beat)
               oh, yes, yes, yes, i did...i wanted to
               talk to you.  i wanted to hook up and
               talk to you.  about what we were talking
               about in your car.

                         wigand
               ...okay.

                         lowell
                   (after a beat)
               makes you feel good?  putting what you
               know to use?

     jeffrey's impressed by lowell's perceptivity...

                         wigand
               how'd you know that, lowell?

                         lowell
               it's obvious, isn't it?

     he looks at liane in the next room, asleep.

                         lowell (cont'd)
               hello.  you there

                         wigand
               yeah...  look, thanks for talking.  i'm
               sorry i woke you up.

                         lowell
               it's okay.

     jeffrey hesitates, holding the phone, then he hangs up...but
     the phone rings right away.

                         wigand
               lowell...?

     but there's thick silence.

                         wigand (cont'd)
               who is this?  do not call here!  do
               not...

     they hang up.  and he realizes he's talking to a dial tone.
     he hangs up.  and as he sits in the patch of light from a
     street lamp, the gun in his hand on his lap, to be up all
     night guarding his family...
