	ext. 1443 locklin - judge croft's glass house - night

	where "annie" the 137 roadster lives as an objet d'art.
	figures in the thicket surrounding the property. memphis,
	sway, kip, tumbler, mirror man, the sphinx...

	mirror man has the mansion's electrical box opened... he' going
	through the wires ... cutting alarm, phone, etc.

	memphis is on the cell phone... face grim... he hangs up.

				memphis
		donny got shot ... a jacker ...

				sway
		how is he -- ?

				memphis
		they got him to the hospital. he's stable ...

	beat ... as they all reflect on this...

				memphis (cont'd)
		on a brighter note: 47 ladies have
		checked in for their south american
		sea cruise -

	this cheers them slightly. until, from the electrical box:

				mirror man
		got it -- !

	and the few remaining lights of 1443 flicker and fade ... they
	regard the house for a beat ...

				sway
		now what -- ?

	no one's quite sure ... they look at the house ... at all that
	glass ... then kip walks to their car ...

				kip
		pop the trunk, tumbler.

				tumbler
		what for -- ?

				kip
		i gotta get my tool --

	and tumbler and mirror man look at each other ...

				mirror man
		no way, homes ...

	too late. the trunk is popped. kip reaches in. comes up with, yes,
	another brick ... and kip walks toward the house. toward the vast
	windows ...

				mirror man (cont'd)
			(to memphis)
		ya' gotta stop him, man --

	but kip forges on, indomitable ... only he passes the huge glass
	windows ... walking, instead, up to the front door ... and he
	smashes the brick down onto the doorknob. knocking it clean off...
	looks back at the others with a wink. and enters the house...
	tumbler runs after him...
