	int. calitri's workshop

	memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. he looks at
	atley...

				atley jackson
		car-jacker. neglected to clean up after
		himself ...

				memphis
		jesus ...

				atley jackson
		the business has changed...

	calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

				calitri
		now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.

				memphis
		i don't want him hurt...

	calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

				calitri
		i'm proud of this work. the bird
		feeder. the wagon wheel planter.
		the dollhouse. the drop-leaf movable
		server...

	he gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. then
	gestures to the yard...

				calitri (cont'd)
		metal. steel. it's cold. ugly. wood
		is warm. clean. provided by nature.
		to see a piece of furniture take shape.
		it's like watching a child grow ...

	memphis glances to atley... atley shrugs ...

				memphis
		i'm sure you're working your way to
		the point.  i'll wait right here ...

	calitri blinks. smiles. nods...

				calitri
		my point. yes. simple, really. i require
		the best. i insist on the best. i only
		engage the best.  your brother. his
		friends. they came to me. they wanted my
		paper. he was your brother. you were the
		best. now. they've brought so much
		goddamn heat down, i may not be able to
		fill this order. which would be very bad
		for me. which in turn, is very bad for
		them...

				memphis
		i could kill you. that occurred to me.
		when i first heard about this. that i
		would kill you ...

				calitri
		grow up. you don't kill people like me.
		people like me die in their sleep at
		87 ... do you know why? because if
		you did kill me, and everyone knew it
		was you - for the next ten years they'd
		be finding pieces of those you love
		scattered all over california ...

	memphis nods, notes a pistol, resting on a shelf nearby.

				calitri (cont'd)
		no, no. you don't kill me, because
		you can't. you don't take your brother
		and run, because we'd find him. you
		don't go to the-police, because we have
		friends there, too. you do nothing:
		except deal with me.

	memphis eyes him...

				memphis
		i can come up with the front money.
		pay you back...

				calitri
		were it only that easy. i have
		obligations. the order needs to be
		filled...

	calitri takes a manila envelope from his desk... hands it to
	memphis, who takes out the single sheet of paper inside.

				calitri (cont'd)
		on that list, you'll find fifty cars.
		fifty. five-zero. they range in
		age from the 1956 ford thunderbird
		to the 1999 toyota camry; and in
		expense from the 1993 volkswagen
		jetta to the 1988 lamborghini
		countach. fifty cars. five-zero.

	memphis scans the list ... looks up at calitri ...

				calitri (cont'd)
		there is a container ship in long
		beach harbor. pier 14. ready to be
		loaded with 4-car-per shipping
		containers, false-walled and
		customsprofiled as motor oil
		designated. the ship leaves in four
		days for south america and the
		men who've tendered me this contract ...

				memphis
		they gave you only four days?

				calitri
		they gave me two weeks. i wasted most of it
		with your brother and his crew, who not
		only lost what pitiful few they managed
		to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our
		endeavor, making this even more difficult
		to achieve ...

	memphis scans the list ...

				calitri (cont'd)
		four days. 50 cars. i'm paying 200
		thousand dollars ...

	now memphis looks up...

				memphis
		i'm not interested --

				calitri
		i knew you'd say that.

				memphis
		i'm just here about my brother.

				calitri
		i knew you'd say that, too --

	calitri smiles ... memphis 'looks at him... at atley realizing
	the trap ...

				memphis
		sound it out for me.

				calitri
		your brother has four days. fifty
		cars. five-zero. for that he gets
		200 large ...

				memphis
		and if he doesn't make it -- ?

	calitri goes to one corner of the shop... takes a tarp off
	of a full couch mahogany casket...

				calitri
		i made this, too. my first one.
		brass extension handles, not plated.
		the coverings are silk, not rayon.
		expensive hardwood. and lined with
		spray green lorraine crepe ...

	memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

				calitri (cont'd)
		yes, yes. i made it for young kip. in
		case he fails. at 8:00 friday morning,
		if that ship sets off without my
		fifty ... kip will take up permanent
		residence in this box ...

	calitri wall switch and the a corrugated steel sliding door is
	raised, revealing a loading dock facing the back of the yard... two
	men are working out there... digger and butz scuzzy dudes, mid-30s
	and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

				calitri (cont'd)
		come here for a second, boys --

	and they come over --

				digger
		evenin', mr. c. --

				calitri
		digger, butz: let me introduce
		you to randall raines. used to
		head up the dandiest ring in
		southern cal. left us
		for parts unknown. randall, this
		is digger. and that's butz -

				digger
		hi, randall --

	memphis says nothing. calitri grins ... nods to digger an butz,
	who go back to work...

				calitri
		digger and butz will be in charge of burial.
		they're good boys ...

	memphis' look is cold and furious ... plaintive:

				memphis
		i don't want them hurt. any of 'em...

				calitri
		"don't want" the dodgers to lose or
		the summer to end. but we
		don't get to choose these things...

	atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. calitri
	turns to memphis...

				calitri (cont'd)
		"nothing that's forced can ever be
		right." old woodworking expression.
		i really don't care how the 50
		get onto my ship ... i just care
		that they do. you decide.

	with that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up
	an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and
	beginning to sand the outside curve of an angled chamfer.
