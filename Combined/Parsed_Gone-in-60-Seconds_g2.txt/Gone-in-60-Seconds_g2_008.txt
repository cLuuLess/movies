	ext. san pedro streets - the lotus

	heading for long beach... stopped at a light ... a camaro pulls up
	next to them... a kid behind the wheel, a blonde beside him...

	kip eyeballs them... engines are revved... challenges are
	implied... mirror man panics ...

				mirror man
		stolen car, kip. stolen car, stolen car,
		stolen car ...

				kip
		stolen fast car...

	and the light turns green ... and he pops the clutch ... and
	they are off ... it's a good old fashioned drag race ... kip
	smiles at the blonde ... mirror man is freaking out ... kip's
	eyes are on fire ... he clocks the speedometer ...

				kip (cont'd)
		it's calibrated for 140 ... let's see
		if these british boys are full of shit
		or not --

				mirror man
		no way, man --

	yes, way. kip floors it. they bury the camaro in its wake... the
	gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... mirror man is having an
	embolism...

	they warp-speed by a police cruiser... both kids totally unaware
	of the police chopper up on high... with them in its sights ...
	and they drive ... at last, ending up at --

	the waterfront - a dark latticework of docks and wharves,
	warehouses and shipping crates... the freighters are somehow
	graceful against the moonlit water ...
