	ext. jimmy's harborside - mirror man

	has cut a key, jocks the cutter, and, before he gets out
	of the boxster, opens the glove box and grabs the
	registration.

	he takes a mini-tape-recorder from his pocket ... reads
	the owner address into the dock... returns the
	registration" to the glove box... leaves the car ... for
	today.
