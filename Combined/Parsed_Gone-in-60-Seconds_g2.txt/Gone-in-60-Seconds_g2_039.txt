	int. "the nautical mile"

	they head toward the bar...

				sway
			(re: his clothes)
		what's with the look?

				memphis
		the hip, cool, sexy thing was getting
		old...

				sway
		you look like you lost your sheep ...

	and she hops back behind the bar ...

				memphis
		you still wrenching at bacchiochi's?

				sway
		hell, yeah. i'm not getting rich in
		here ...

				memphis
		buy you a drink?

				sway
		nope. i got a coffee. and a
		boyfriend.

	she waves to a 30-year-old cat drinking with his buddies. he waves
	back. memphis frowns.

				sway (cont'd)
		mitch.

				memphis
		"mitch?"

				sway
		mitch.

				memphis
		so i was replaced by mitch?

				sway
		no. you were replaced by alex.
		who was replaced by kevin. who
		was replaced by vince. who was
		replaced by mitch...

	she smiles sourly at him...

				memphis
		wow. and to think all i
		accomplished these past six
		years was the "lord of the
		rings" trilogy...

	she stares at him... shakes her head... busies herself with her
	glassware ... beat ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		you look great --

				sway
		yeah, well, you always were a sucker
		for flawed existences ...

	angle - mitch. watching them talk ...

				sway (cont'd)
		you should leave --

				memphis
		on account of mitch?

				sway
		on account of me.

	he studies her... then:

				memphis
		i've taken the spear for a lot of
		people, sway. including you. can't
		we improvise a little here ... ?

				sway
		no can do. life goes on, pointfive ...
		you left me, remember?

				memphis
		i left town. i didn't leave you.

				sway
		a distinction worth noting ...

				memphis
		and here i am...

				sway
		yes. but i got a feeling it's not on
		account of any longing-for-my-touch
		on your part -

				memphis
		kip's in trouble

	and now she looks concerned

				sway
		what kind of trouble -- ?

				memphis
		kip took a job. fifty ladies in two weeks.
		only the two weeks have turned into four
		days. and not a single lady has been
		snared.

				sway
		and you got some italians -- ?

				memphis
		six or seven...

				sway
		i'm not doing it anymore. haven't
		for a while. i've carved out something
		for myself. it's pathetic, but it's mine ...

				memphis
		i understand -

	and the cat - mitch - comes over with two empty pitchers

				mitch
		another round, sara -

				sway
		sure, mitch -

	and she goes to the tap ... leaving memphis and mitch ...

				mitch
		how you doing, pal?

	memphis nods ... beat. they sit there. regard sway...

				mitch (cont'd)
		she's hot, right?

				memphis
		i'd go so far as to say "lovely."

	and mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

				mitch
		you should her face when she's having
		sex --

	and memphis turns to him...

				memphis
		really?

				mitch
		really...

				memphis
		what's it look like?

	and memphis reaches out, and grabs mitch's nipple, pinching.
	mitch's face curls ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		is it a squinty, grimacing, contorted
		face? agonized and writhing and ugly?
		oh, now i see it, yes, yes!

	and memphis releases him... and mitch goes down hard ... and sway
	comes over ...

				sway
		what the hell are you doing -- ?

				memphis
		if you change your mind. we're at
		otto's. it's 50 ladies in 24 hours.
		for the carpenter. 200 k and kip's
		life on the felt. so long now ...

	and he's out of there, before mitch's pals can get to him.

				mitch
		who was that guy, sara?

	she looks at the door ... shrugs ...

				sway
		good question ...
