	int. otto's auto - back room - day

	to queen's "i'm in love with my car." the crew is at work, a mazda
	and a caddy are parked here for practice: tumbler is modifying a
	series of slim jims, based on the type of cars they'll be after

	donny and freb are in the caddy, freb behind the wheel tumbler
	puts together briefcases, containing the requisite tools: slim-
	jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with
	pointy leads ...

	- mirror man is showing off one of his gadgets - beepersized
	device - to otto... they stand before a locked mazda.

				mirror man
		and you just stick it in the lock.
		hit this little button ... and ...

	he does ... the door unlocks ... the car's alarm gives a weak
	chirp and dies... otto looks at donny ...

				otto
		we're dinosaurs, donny. pull-up a tar pit ...
			(to mirror man)
		can i try -- ?

				mirror man
		knock yourself out --

	kip and memphis are with toby, who has his laptop out ...

				toby
		i logged outside the g.r.a.b. site,
		right? then i monitored their
		incoming outside data requests,
		right? then i got these isdn numbers,
		right? then i tracked them back,
		right? then i took the one i could
		jack-up the easiest, right? then i
		called back see, they think i'm an
		insurance company - that's where it
		looks like i'm coming from -- and
		they're sharing stats with this
		insurance company, right? so now
		they're sharing it with me, right?
		they think i'm looking for stats for
		an actuarial conference on auto-theft.
		so they let me in, right? give me all
		these numbers. but then i don't leave,
		right? i'm in. i've got the key. now i
		just go anywhere i want.

				memphis
		so what's in there -- ?

				toby
		i can tell you who's gonna be on duty
		tonight. i can tell you how much gas
		they're using monthly. i can tell you
		how they used to spend that annoying
		half-hour between "friends" and "seinfeld"...

	memphis nods ... fairly impressed...

				kip
		good work, toby --

	donny and freb are inside the caddy ... freb's attempts to start
	it fail...

				freb
		it just ain't happening --

				donny astricky
		you'll get the hang of it, kid. you
		just need to remember one thing -

				freb
		what's that?

	donny smiles ...

				donny astricky
		on boost night? always take along a
		good mix tape ...

	donny smiles ... freb frowns ...

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		you bring a woman back to your
		crib for some lovemaking, the
		song you put on, depends on the
		woman, the type of lovemaking you
		intend to do, right?

				freb
		i guess ...

				donny astricky
		you got a school teacher or nancy from
		accounting, you don't put on sly stone
		or james brown. you put on
		ravel. rachmaninoff. but if you got
		some wild one you just picked
		up at the track, you wouldn't put on
		cat stevens or james taylor.
		you'd put on prince. or isaac hayes.
		or, if you really wanted to
		get after it: miles.

				freb
		okay ...

				donny astricky
		it's the same way with cars. different
		cars. different tunes. you can't steal
		a maserati listening to sinatra. you
		gotta get urgent. you gotta get sonny
		rollins or led zeppelin iv, on that
		shit. but never, never-ever take no allman
		brothers into a lincoln town car. could
		lead to disaster. got it... ?

				freb
			(absolutely hasn't got it)
		got it ...

				donny astricky
		good.

	and then sway enters ... donny gets out of the caddy ...

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		whoa, whoa, whoa. memphis went out
		and got some big game ... hello, sway.
		i was just telling the lads about mix
		tapes --

				sway
			(to freb)
		janis joplin. billie holliday. ella
		fitzgerald...

				donny astricky
		gender bias ...

	otto is before her ... bowing from the waist ...

				otto
		i've missed you, sara wayland --

				sway
		good to see ya, otto --

	they embrace. memphis and kip enter from the other room...

				kip
		how ya doing, sway -- ?

				sway
		kip...

	she looks at memphis ... small nod... small smile ...

				donny astricky
		what do you think about all this?

				sway
		stick it in the drawer marked "fool's
		errand", right -- ?

				donny astricky
		that's my girl --

				memphis
		that's mirror man ... and that's
		freb ... and tumbler ... and toby ...
		fellas, this is sara wayland... they
		call her "sway."

				sway
		hey -

	but the kids look high near thunderstruck ... the others laugh ...
	go back to their work ... memphis and sway

				sway (cont'd)
		no questions. i'm here. i need the
		dough.

				memphis
		of course ...

	she studies him... nods ...

				sway
		good. just so we understand...

	and then she sees something at the entrance ...

				sway (cont'd)
		oh, shit. you didn't --

	he follows her gaze ... to where -- a man, early 40s, has walked
	in. tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. this man never speaks. and his nose is
	a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... which is why they call him

	the sphinx

	and the others really don't dig his scene ...

				donny astricky
		well, well, well. the original crash
		test dummy...

	the sphinx nods to all. smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.
	freb whispers to otto ...

				freb
		who's that -- ?

				otto
		that's the sphinx.

				freb 
		the sphinx?

				otto
		he never says a word. and he's got
		a messed-up nose. hence. the sphinx.
		he's boo-koo koo-koo. but he steals like
		time ...
			(to the sphinx)
		hello, sphinxy, old rum -- !

	and otto embraces the taller man ... and the others stand
	around, offering uneasy glances to the sphinx ...

				memphis
		okay. we're all here. today's wednesday.
		d-day is friday night ... that gives us
		two days to prep ... we're going to find
		the ladies on our list, find out where
		they live, when they're home; that
		they're properly insured ... let's get
		into the vans --

				mirror man
		where we going -- ?

				memphis
		we're going shopping -- !

	we pre-lap gary numan's new-wave rave classic "cars".
