	ext. independence, california - day - 6 years later

	some 400 miles north of los angeles, independence is a one
	horse town, and the horse has died... single stop light,
	single-engine firehouse, single everything. norman rockwell
	would find this burg a snooze.. - we settle on a small,
	garage ... the peeling sign reads:

	"l.n. orr automotive"

	owned and operated by memphis raines ... in blue coveralls,
	memphis has a plymouth duster up on the lift ... with him is a kid
	- tom, 19... lightnin' hopkins' "automobile blues" plays through --

				memphis
		you know what you got here?

				tom
		not really -

				memphis
		there's excessive resistance in the cranking
		circuit ... you know what you gotta do -- ?

				tom
		not really --

				memphis
		you have any other answers besides
		"not really"?

				tom
		not --

				memphis
		right. you want to test the voltage drop ...
		use the voltmeter ... remove the primary
		lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ...
		see what you got ... you understand -- ?

	tom starts to say "not really". instead, he nods. memphis takes a
	root beer from an old-style machine. he goes out ... front ... to
	where an old denver pyle-coot - budgy - sits on a bench, smoking
	an unfiltered lucky ... memphis sits beside him, pets the 
	200-year-old dog that lounges nearby...

				budgy
		just can't find good help these days --

				memphis
			(re: cigarette)
		those things'll kill ya, budgy --

				budgy
		they won't have a chance. the bourbon and
		bacon'll get me first...

	budgy cackles ... memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ...
	budgy points at a passing car ...

				budgy (cont'd)
		that one -

				memphis
		1980 mercury cougar. 255 cubic inch v8 ...
		based on the ford thunderbird bodyshell;
		they modified the chassis, but didn't
		improve its performance...

	budgy points at another car ... and we get the sense they play
	this game every day...

				memphis (cont'd)
		the 1970 plymouth road runner. proof
		positive of a single all-powerful deity.
		the first bargain-priced muscle car
		ever. they even tuned the horn to
		resemble the "beep beep" sound of the
		cartoon road runner ...

	and budgy looks impressed... as always ...

				budgy
		damn, you're good

	memphis nods ... sips his root beer ...

				budgy (cont'd)
		you got to bingo last night?

	memphis looks at him ... can't believe it himself ...

				memphis
		that i did, budgy. that i did --

	and, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific grind of
	metal on metal, as tom has started the plymouth -

				tom (o.s.)
		uh ... randall -- ?

				memphis
		excuse me --

	memphis goes back into the garage, budgy cackles.
