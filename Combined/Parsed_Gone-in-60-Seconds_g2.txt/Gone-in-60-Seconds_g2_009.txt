	int. warehouse

	tumbler studies his watch... now he's a little concerned ... he
	looks up ... atley is glaring at him...

				atley jackson
		something wrong, tumbler -- ?

				tumbler
		yeah. i'm missing springer --

	and then the lotus pulls into the warehouse... tumbler flashes
	atley a "told-you-so" smile... kip and mirror man get out of the
	car...

	kip walks over to a clipboard with a magic marker tethered to it
	... it is a list of cars ... he draws a black line through "13)
	1996 lotus esprit v8"... the others are clocking the car...

				atley jackson
		she'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --

				mirror man
		i can vouch for that.

	tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... the vibe is celebratory...

				tumbler
		thirteen down ... thirty-seven to go ...

				kip
		no problem -

	bottles are clinked... beer is sipped ... only, a hot white
	spotlight bores through the skylight ... and the whup-whup of the
	chopper's rotors... and now the sounds of sirens ... and the 
	thuggish man gets to his feet ...

				thuggish man
		let's get outta here -- !

	and they do... heading out the back ... it's tough for atley with
	his limp ... on the way out:

				atley jackson
		now you gone and done it, raines
		and they flee ...
