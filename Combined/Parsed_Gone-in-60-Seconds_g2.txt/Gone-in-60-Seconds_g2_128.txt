	ext. warehouse -long beach harbor - night

	as the 'vette comes screaming into the warehouse ... kip exploding
	out of it ... getting into the back. memphis goes to the car, sees
	toby ... front of his shirt covered in blood ... the others gather
	around...

				mirror man
		jesus ...

	memphis climbs into the car ... kip is holding toby...

				kip
		i didn't know... should we take him to
		a hospital? i didn't know. i didn't.

	toby is clearly dying in kip's arms...

				toby
		kip. kip. kip. tell me: what's
		gonna happen? what's gonna happen?

	but kip is lost ... doesn't know what to say --

				memphis
		you're gonna be okay, toby... you are ...
		we'll getcha fixed up...

				toby
		no ... no... no ... tell me what's
		gonna happen? kip? tell me. what's
		gonna happen?

	the brothers stare at the boy... kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...

				toby (cont'd)
		what's gonna happen? i don't feel ...
		like ... this ... should.... happen ...
		right ... now. i...haven't... done ...
		shit... tears running down his eyes...

				kip
		shhhhhh, shhhhh ...

	kip looks to his brother for help ...

				memphis
		call 911 -

				mirror man
		call 'em here -- ?

				memphis
		do it! now -- !

	and mirror man scurries for the phone... toby's breathing comes
	out in short staccato bursts ...

				toby
		kip... kip... kip... it doesn't
		feel... it doesn't feel... it doesn't
		feel... good

	he looks up at kip. all of the light goes out of his eyes. and
	toby is dead... kip holds him for a beat ... then passes him to a
	surprisingly emotional tumbler ... kip gets out of the car, runs
	for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

	the others are stunned... mirror man hangs up the phone ...
	memphis gets out of the car ... he goes after kip ... finds him in
	one of the containers ... grabs him by the collars ...

				memphis
		what did i tell you? what? what did
		i tell you?

				kip
		i don't know. what -- ?

	and kip looks at him... tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...
	and kip looks so lost ... so like a little kid...

				memphis
		come here --

				kip
		what?

				memphis
		come here -

				kip
		what?

				memphis
		come here -

	and kip does ... he walks to memphis ... and memphis puts his arms
	around him... and that's it. the floodgates open. kip begins to
	sob. deep, painful, racking sobs. and then:

				kip
		i've missed you, man ...

				memphis
		i know. i've missed you, too 

	and they hold each other ...

				kip
		toby...

				memphis
		i know ...

				kip
		toby...

	and they stay in the embrace... and then memphis unwraps kip's
	arms from around him...

				memphis
		stay here. stay here a while. i'll
		be back ...

	kip nods, sniffles ... memphis walks out of the container ... he
	strides up to the others ... glances at toby's clipboard, with all
	the cars crossed-out ... he goes to sway...

				memphis (cont'd)
		give me a ride -- ?

				sway
		where to -- ?

				memphis
		kip's not clear yet. we got one more
		to go --

	and she nods ... and climbs into one of the escorts... and off
	they go ... the others standing around the 'vette and toby's
	body...

	angle - the clipboard. one car left. eleanor.

	as a super on-screen reads: part iv: dreams of you
