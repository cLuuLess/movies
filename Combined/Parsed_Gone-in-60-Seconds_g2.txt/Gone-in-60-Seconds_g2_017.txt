	ext. woodburn scrap and metal - night

	a virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up
	high for as far as the eye can see ... a huge fork lift scoops up
	a wreck and hauls it over to the crusher... watch as the car is
	flattened, for easy shelving ...

	midnight auto nonpareil ... to one side of the yard is a garage:
	watch as a honda accord, with a bloody windshield, enters the
	garage. a young mexican kid driving.

	a sign: "lock your car or it may be gone in 60 seconds!"
