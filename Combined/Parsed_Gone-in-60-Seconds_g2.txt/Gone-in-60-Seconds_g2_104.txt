	int. san pedro warehouse

	sway sets to prepping the cars ... the others wait nearby. memphis
	walks over to where kip sits ...

				memphis

				kip

	memphis looks at his watch...

				kip (cont'd)

				memphis

				kip
		nah.

				memphis
		that's strange. i'm nervous. donny's nervous.
		everyone's nervous. but not you...

				kip
		i dunno. whatever will be will be...

				memphis
		that's a good attitude, kip. for
		everything but stealing cars ...

	before kip can respond, the signature throaty roar of ferrari
	fills the room, as sway's got one started --

				memphis (cont'd)
		showtime --
