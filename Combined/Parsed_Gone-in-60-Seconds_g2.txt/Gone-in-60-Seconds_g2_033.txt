	ext. otto's auto - night

	the hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration
	operation ...

	dig the 157 chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with
	orange fur interior is installed... dig the 153 corvette
	as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils
	and airshocks ... dig the 150 merc, as its chrome is
	stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes
	brazed...

	all under the watchful eye of...

	otto halliwell

	late 60s. a feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the
	question: how the hell did they manage to rock together
	yoda and the ghost of walter huston... ?

	but he remains the zen master of cars and all that cars are, were
	and can be ...

	his mixed-breed mutt - hemi - licks his balls in one corner

	otto is currently airbrushing a candy-colored, variegated design
	on the deck lid of a camaro ... it is painstaking work ... but he
	is an artist ...

	his woman - junie - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand
	dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

	memphis wanders in...

	otto sees memphis ... drops his brush... he walks over to memphis
	... takes him in his arms ... hugs him close... actually waltzes
	him a few steps ...

	memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone
	through ...

				otto
		am i dying? are all the angels of my life
		returning to bid a final farewell?
			(holds him at arm's length)
		and have my angels completely lost
		their fashion sense -- ?
			
				memphis
		hello, otto ...

				otto
		you remember junie?

				memphis
		of course. hi, junie --

				junie
		hello, memphis -

				memphis
		what happened here -- ?

				otto
		whatever do you mean?

				memphis
		the chop-shop... where are the stripped
		cars?  the rolled-back odometers? the
		part bins?

				otto
		what happened? old-age happened. i tired of
		killing them. i woke up one morning and thought
		i am no longer a destroyer. i am a means of
		resurrection. now. we restore. we revive.
		there are so few things in this life, we can
		prevent from decay. most must die. these don't
		have to...

	he calls over to the mexican man working on the pick-up ...

				otto (cont'd)
		it's 3 coats of primer, 12 coats of black
		acrylic lacquer before laying out the
		flames ... and fill the cab top with mylar
		flakes ... they'll sparkle like stars ...
			(turns to memphis)
		randall, randall, randall ... you look
		splendid ...

				memphis
		you, too, otto

	and otto goes back to the camaro ... to finish his work...

				otto
		i heard rumors you were back. about
		kip ...

				memphis
		he's gotten involved --

	otto looks up frustrated... to junie

				otto (o.s.)
		i can't concentrate. play something, my
		sweetness; my reason to rise ...

	and junie hits play on a cassette deck ... and, instantly, engine
	sounds rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... otto listens, as
	if it were a mahler symphony...

				otto (cont'd)
		the ferrari 365 gtb/4 daytona. at le
		mans. 1971. the quad-cam v12. hear
		how they got the engine up?
		hear those exhaust notes? that's a
		very wide rev range... here, it
		peaks at 5500 rpm...

	memphis smiles ... these eccentricities are old hat...

				otto (cont'd)
		raymond calitri. he's amplified much
		sorrow on these streets ...

				memphis
		you think it can be done?

				otto
		are you considering a comeback tour?

				memphis
		tell me...

				otto
		it can be done. take two days to shop;
		one to prep. i'll offer up my bible
		for a small fee. you also have to
		hope kip's jerk-circus didn't undo
		castlebeck's linkage so much so
		that he's setting up surveillance
		teams on every city block. and
		then get yourself a crew...

				memphis
		the hard part ...

				otto
		"a people is a detour of nature to
		get 6 or 7 great men - yes, and then
		to get around them..." nietzsche said
		that.

				memphis
		is he still working here ?

				otto
		the old crew. go find them. i can't
		help you with that. since i've cleaned
		up the act a bit, they no longer come
		around... a pity how legitimacy makes
		you unpopular -

				memphis
		i just don't know how happy they'll be
		to see me

	otto has finished the camaro ... he looks at memphis --

				otto
		i remember i had a 1964 buick opal.
		worst car ever built. value job.
		everything broke and i-fixed it.
		a coma car - built to german specs.
		plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head.
		on a quiet night, you could hear it
		rusting in the garage. but when that
		car was gone, i missed it. if it came
		driving back in here right now,
		there'd be tears and laughter ...

				memphis
		and the moral of that story is -- ?

				otto
		go to them. they'll be happy to see
		you ... ahhh...

	and he closes his eyes ... to listen to the ferrari tape ...

				otto (cont'd)
		... 8.8:1 compression...

	we pre-lap simon and garfunkel's "baby driver" and cut to:

	close on: a sign reading: "pleasure cruise driving school"

	atop a moving dodge aries k. which is nearly side-swiped by an
	oncoming pick-up. a man howls in terror...
