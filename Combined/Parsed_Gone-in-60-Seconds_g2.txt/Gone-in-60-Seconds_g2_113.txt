	int. lamborghini countach - moving - night

	the sphinx drives ... mirror man pops in his tape ... albert
	king's "drivin' wheel."

				mirror man
		that's what i'm talkin' about -- !

	he boogies down. the sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's
	magnificent power. but then mirror man screams -- ! with pure
	terror. for, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

	a boa constrictor - some 8-feet long... a mass of heavilykeeled
	scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... mirror man screams on and 
	on...

	the sphinx swerves wildly... racing through a red light. barely
	missing an on-coming bus ... passing a pair of cops coming out of
	a 7-11. they hop into their unit. give chase.
