	int. "l.n. orr automotive" - independence - dusk

	memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. when a
	brand new purple mercedes slk, windows tinted, pulls in out front.
	it looks oddly anachronistic here in independence. memphis senses
	danger. he goes out. budgy and his dog are here... budgy looks
	spooked... tom, too ...

				memphis
		what's going on -- ?

	and standing there, by the mercedes, like a wraith, is atley
	jackson, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... as out of
	place here as a maggot on a muffin...

				atley jackson
		well, well, well ...

	and he begins to sing...

				atley jackson (cont'd)
			(andy griffith theme)
		da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc.
			(laughs)
		are you kidding me, man -- ?

				memphis
		hello, atley ...

				atley jackson (re: sign)
		l.n. orr. i get it. clever ...

	memphis studies him...

				memphis
		how's the leg?

				atley jackson
		only hurts when i breathe. lookit
		you. where are barney fife and aunt
		bea hanging out? and opie ... where's
		opie at?

	he laughs some more ... chain-lights his cig ...

				memphis
		what are you doing here?

				atley jackson
		is there someplace we can talk?

	memphis looks at him...

				memphis
