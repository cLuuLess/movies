	int. otto's auto - night

	in a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: memphis
	and donny sit... with the list before them...

				donny astricky
		most of 'em are late-model...

				memphis
		that's right. only 10 exotics ...

				donny astricky
		we'll have to start beating the
		bushes, find out where they live...

	otto enters. giggles...

				otto
		some crew you got ...

				memphis
		if we put out the word. that we're
		crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
		what do you think that'll yield?

				donny astricky
		a bunch of strung-out hypes and stick-
		up men. this ain't like the old days,
		memphis. the profession has lost its..

				otto
		dignity...

				donny astricky
		yeah...

				memphis
		well, the three of us don't'exactly
		inspire confidence...

	beat ... donny examines the list ...

				donny astricky
		wow! they got eleanor here -- ?

				memphis
		i know. weird, huh -- ?

	the door opens ... one of otto's workers is there...

				worker
		otto, there's someone here to --

	but they walk past: kip, tumbler, mirror man, toby, freb

				donny astricky
		lookit kip. all grown up...

				kip
		hey, donny --

				memphis
		what are you doing here?

				kip
		otto called -

	memphis looks to otto ... otto shrugs ...

				otto
		you need him...

				memphis
		no we don't -

				otto
		i appreciate your dilemma, memphis.
		but how are two washed-up thieves
		and an old man supposed to boost
		50 cars in three days...

				memphis
		his criminal career has officially come
		to a close ...

				otto
		the conundrum still applies, of course. the
		purpose of the endeavor is to rescue
		baby brother from imminent
		death and/or a life of crime. however.
		this cannot be successfully
		carried out without baby brother's
		considerable resources, shabby
		though they may be.

	memphis considers ... he has little choice ...

				memphis
		we do this. then. you're finished.
		then. you're clean

				kip
		i like how you wallop back in here -
		after four years - and can still get all
		clifford huxtable on my shit ...

				memphis
		you hear me?

				kip
		i hear ya. get me outta this. i'll
		move to the country. open a fruit
		stand...

	memphis looks at him... shakes his head...

				donny astricky
		you guys have any skills at all?

				kip
		hell, yeah. mirror man here is
		our electronics expert. he's got
		some gadgets you old farts maybe
		never -heard of; tumbler can drive
		anything with wheels, and some
		things without; toby's a hacker,
		can do things with a computer, that
		are pretty amazing ...

				memphis
		how old are you now, toby?

				toby
		sixteen. but my birthday's in seven
		months ...

	memphis shakes his head... sighs ...

				donny astricky 
			(re: freb)
		what about him?

				kip
		freb can order pizzas like nobody's
		business

	freb starts to protest ... shrugs ...

				freb
		people gotta eat ...

	memphis looks at all of them ... sighs...

				memphis
		okay, then... otto?

				otto
		in order to succeed, you're going
		to have to go old-school. one night
		boost. put all your nuts in one basket.
		and...

				tumbler
		one night? are you nuts?

				memphis
		you got maybe a better plan?

	tumbler looks to kip...

				kip
		you spread it out ... you move around...
		so's they can't touch you... so's they
		don't know... shadow games and shit
		...

				memphis
		"shadow games?"

				kip
		shadow games ...

				memphis
		you spread it out, by the 2nd night,
		the heat are onto you. know
		something's up. with a one-night boost,
		by the time all the cars are reported
		stolen, your ship's set sail.

	kip and the others nod... makes sense ...

				memphis (cont'd)
		go on, otto -

				otto
		we're on a truncated time-table. take a day to
		shop it; a day to prep it ... and we're still
		going to need to expand the crew...

				donny astricky
		there's no one left ...

				otto
		we've got several italian cars on the list.
		always tricky, always timeconsuming. so
		we're gonna need a specialist ...

	memphis looks at him. because that's what he was afraid of.

				mirror man 
			(to otto)
		you know of one -- ?

				memphis
		yeah. he's knows of one all right.

	so we'll pre-lap the beach boys' "409" and cut to:
