	ext. city streets - palos verdes - night

	the lotus races through these streets ... at high speeds ...

				mirror man
		newsflash, kip: you're driving a
		stolen car

	kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

				kip
		yeah. ain't it great -- ?

	and he pins her ... vrooooom -- !

									cut to:

	a tennis ball

	being bounced against the wall ... caught ... bounced again ...
	thunk! thunk! thunk!
