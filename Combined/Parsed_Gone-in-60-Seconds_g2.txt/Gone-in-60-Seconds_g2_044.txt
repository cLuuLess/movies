	ext. long beach streets - day

	a montage of the hard-core old-school preparations...

	three mini-vans drive off from otto's auto - mirror man at the
	wheel of one of them - the sphinx and donny with him... - freb
	drives the 2nd van: memphis, sway, and kip with him... tumbler
	drives the 3rd van: otto and toby with him.

	they carry pens and notebooks ... and, as they drive around,
	they're searching out cars ... when they see an auto that
	corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate.

	memphis dials the cell ... mirror man answers on the speaker in
	his van ... tumbler in his ... we'll cross-cut the scene as
	necessary from van to van ...

				memphis
		how's it going -- ?

				donny astricky
		it's arright ...

	they drive on ... till --

				donny astricky (cont'd)
		check it out: 173 firebird. know
		who drove one of those ... ?

				otto
		yes, i do, in fact. john wayne in
		mco...

				donny astricky
		that's being obscurest ... who else?
		better known. memphis?

				memphis
		jim rockford. rockford files.

				mirror man
		for real?

	as the scenes in the vans play out - we should be intercutting

	with shots of cars on the street. license plates. their notebooks.
	as license #s are written down.

				donny astricky
		for real. okay. gimme columbo...
