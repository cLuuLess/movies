	int. teddy's tavern - night

	a barmaid sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

				waitress
		there you go --

				memphis
		thanks, donna --

	she leaves... atley is staring at him... memphis shrugs...

				atley jackson
		it's been a long time, memphis --

				memphis
		six years ...

				atley jackson
		six years. shit. time flies, don't it?
		six years ago we were fartin' through
		armani and pissin' cristal.
		now look at us ...

		memphis
		tell me about kip -

	atley takes a sip of his beer,...

				atley jackson
		he took a job. and he fumbled it.
		now he's jammed-up. jammed-up bad...

				memphis
		what kind of job... ?

				atley jackson
		a boost. a big boost ...

				memphis
		a boost? what's kip doing on a boost?

	atley frowns ... looks at him...

				atley jackson
		you're shittin', right?

	clearly memphis is not ...

				atley jackson (cont'd)
		kip's become quite the little
		crewrunner since you left. he's been
		working a low-rent ring for
		two years now. you don't talk to
		your ma?

				memphis
		it seems she neglected to mention it

				atley jackson
		maybe she don't know. although i don't
		see how that could be. maybe she didn't
		want to upset you -

				memphis
		don't feel the need to explore my family
		dynamics, atley...

				atley jackson
		the point is: kip's been living the
		life. only he's a wild child. crazy.
		makes our old behavior seem like
		altar boy time. but he fungold this
		one so bad, folks around l.b.
		are already speakin' about him in
		the past tense.

	memphis takes a beat ... sips at his brew ... then:

				memphis
		who was the job for?

				atley jackson
		who do you think?

	memphis waits ... in no mood for guessing games ...

				atley jackson (cont'd)
		calitri, man. raymond "the carpenter"
		calitri ... your favorite and mine ...

	which means nothing to us ... though the look on memphis, face
	speaks volumes ...

				atley jackson (cont'd)
		i just thought you should know,
		man. i kind of had a feeling you
		didn't. but i should tell you:
		i'm working for him now - the
		carpenter - so if you see him, you
		won't mention me coming to get
		you... like i said: i just thought
		... i owed you ... and that it was
		the right thing to do ...

	memphis nods ... his face clenched in despair. we fade to black,
	as a super on-screen reads: part 1: stolen moments

	we pre-lap j. geils band's "hard-drivin' man" and cut to:

	three plates of bacon, eggs and hash browns

	placed on the service deck by a short-order cook...
