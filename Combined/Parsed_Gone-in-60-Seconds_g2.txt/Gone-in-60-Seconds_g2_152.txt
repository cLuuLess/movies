	ext. landfill - rhode island - day

	a vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. deserted,
	except for the panel van parked dead center. digger and butz slide
	the casket from the van, parked before an already dug grave.

	as they move the casket, a knocking from inside. a pounding. and
	muffled cries. digger and butz exchange a horrified glance... they
	stare at the casket, spooked.

				butz
		do you believe this?

				digger
		what should we do?

				butz
		we gotta do what we gotta do --

				digger
		shit. i hate the screamers, man. why
		can't he finish the freakin' job?

				butz
		forget about it. occupational hazard,
		digger. c'mon...

	and just as we think they're sure to open it -- they drop the
	casket into the hole -- !

	and begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant
	thumping and pounding and yelling -- and soon the casket is
	covered in dirt. gone.

	and we pre-lap the turtles' pop gem "eleanor" ("you got a thing
	about you/i just can't live without you/i really want
	you/ eleanor near me...")  cut to:
