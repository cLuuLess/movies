	ext. otto's salvage - day

	otto, the sphinx, tumbler, freb and mirror man are sipping coffee
	and eating donuts ... they are exhausted... memphis and kip pull
	up in eleanor... he hands otto the briefcase. otto opens it... all
	that cash...

				memphis
		split it up. any word on donny?

				otto
		he's gonna be okay. could do a bit.

				memphis
		what happened to sway?

				otto
		she left...

	he nods ... the boys are huddled together...

				mirror man
		poor toby, man...

	a few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

				the sphinx 
		if his premature demise has, in some way,
		enlightened the rest of you as to the
		grim finish below the glossy veneer of
		criminal life, and inspired you to change
		your ways, then his death carries with it
		an inherent nobility. and a supreme
		glory. we should all be so fortunate.
		you can say 'poor toby." i say: "poor us.."

	they all stare at him, stunned...

				freb
		you spoke

	the sphinx shrugs...

				tumbler
		say something else, man

	but the sphinx lapses back into his silence ... nibbles a donut
	... sips coffee ... memphis smiles ... he takes a stack of bills
	from the briefcase... to kip:

				memphis
		you remember where you got this
		eleanor -- ?

				kip
		sure, man --

				memphis
		she's for sale. they're asking forty thousand.
		give 'em sixty ...

	and he hands kip the cash ...

				kip
		you want me to buy her?

				memphis
		shocking, huh? we're clear now. it's done.
		i've never actually paid for a car. i want
		to see what it feels like

	kip nods ... memphis looks at a grinning otto ...

				otto
		dinosaurs. all of us. the ice age is
		now...

				memphis
		i'll see you soon --

				kip
		where you off to -- ?

				memphis
		thought i'd go for a ride -

	he smiles. the others do, too. memphis heads for eleanor.

				kip
		hey, memphis -- ?

	memphis turns back...

				kip (cont'd)
		i'll see you, right?

	memphis nods ...

				memphis
		you'll see me ...

	and we pre-lap sammy john's "chevy van" and cut to:
