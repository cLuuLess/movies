int. subway 
station - upper level - continuous
the upper level 
is almost completely empty save a few kids and late-night commuters. julia is 
hysterical now. the first time we've seen her lose control.
she looks 
around frantically. spots paul and sam going down the escalator together.
julia
paul!
julia rushes 
towards the turnstiles. jumps them. a guard steps out of his booth.
guard
hey! you need a 
ticket! hey!!!
she keeps 
going.
