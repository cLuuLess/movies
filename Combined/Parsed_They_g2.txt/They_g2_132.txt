int. range 
rover - night
julia tosses 
down the cell phone. the car engine stops.
julia
what now?
she tries to 
start the car, but it the engine won't turn over. just as she's about to try a 
second time, she looks out the windshield.
several dark 
shapes stand in front of the rover. watching. the customers from the coffee 
shop. some are standing right outside the door. others are silhouetted in the 
street.
julia 
frantically tries to start the car again. no dice.
she rips open 
the door.
