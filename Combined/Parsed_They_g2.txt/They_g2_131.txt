int. range 
rover - night
intercut 
between julia and paul.
julia
then it's 
already started.
paul
what's 
started?
terrified beat. 
julia trains her eyes on the coffee shop.
julia
listen. there's 
not much time. they're watching me right now.
paul
who is?
julia
just listen to 
me. there were five of us at the cabin.
(beat)
your best 
friend was with us. joey. he had blond hair. he had a superman tattoo on his 
shoulder.
paul
i don't know 
anyone named joey.
julia
that's because 
they erased your memory. if you remembered him ... if you remembered what they 
did to him, you might run like sam. that would make it hard for them to hunt you 
down.
paul
where's 
sam?
julia
he's dead.
paul
what?
julia
they killed 
him.
paul
they?
julia
monsters.
paul can barely 
stand up. his skull is pounding.
paul
monsters?
julia
they really 
exist, paul. they use human beings for parts. like machines.
paul
i can't take 
this.
julia
what you saw in 
the forest wasn't a hallucination. they've been watching us the entire time. 
following us.
paul
i can't --
julia
there's a 
tracking device in your head. right where the scab is.
her words sound 
chilling in the night air. foreboding and deadly. paul is filled with dread.
paul
my head?
julia
they want us 
for parts. that's why they're tracking us. they take the skin and wear it.
paul
just let me 
think for a second.
julia
they already 
got sam and terry. and now they're making us disappear.
(then)
think about it. 
your wallet. your father.
paul
it can't be 
true.
julia
it is true! 
we're next!
paul becomes 
upset. he nods with grave understanding.
paul
what are we 
gonna do?
julia
we have to get 
back home. they're all over the place, but we can make it.
paul
okay.
julia
where are 
you?
paul
just below 
union square. right near the cable cars. where they turn them around.
julia
all right. 
there's a subway station near there.
paul
i can see 
it.
julia
wait for me. at 
the top of the stairs. i'll be there in five minutes.
paul
okay.
julia
i love you.
paul
(in 
pain)
i love you. 
please hurry.
paul hangs 
up.
