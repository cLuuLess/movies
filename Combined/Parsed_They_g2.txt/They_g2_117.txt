int. elevator - 
night
the car starts going down. floor lights blink above 
the door.
8 ... 7 ... 6 ...
terry punches out 9-1-1 on the&nbsp; cell phone's keypad. nothing comes 
through the receiver. only static.
terry
come on ... 
come on ...
she dials 
again.
4 ... 3 ... 2 
...
more static 
over the cell phone. terry has started crying in anguish when the elevator comes 
to an abrupt halt.
the doors stay 
closed.
terry looks 
above the elevator doors. the floor light reads --
"b" 
(basement)
terry starts 
pressing for the lobby. the elevator won't move. she presses the "door open" 
button, the alarm button, anything at all. nothing responds.
terry (cont'd)
help! somebody! 
help me!!!
nothing. futile 
silence. she's about to try dialing on the cell phone again, when ...
whump. a heavy 
thudding sound above the elevator car roof. the light overhead flickers like a 
candle. terry gazes at the failing light, then tracks her eyes towards the trap 
door in the roof.
a few more hollow thumps.
terry is 
petrified. she takes a step backward. the light flashes off and on again ... 
creating a strobe light effect.
behind her, the 
elevator doors silently pull open.
terry's gaze is 
still focussed on the ceiling trap door. behind her, the basement is pitch 
black. she continues moving backwards towards the open elevator doors, step 
after step, completely unaware ...
until something 
leaps out of the dark and grabs her.
in the moment 
it takes to draw a breath and scream, it's already over.
the light goes 
out.
