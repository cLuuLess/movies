ext. woods - 
walking trail - day
paul and terry 
are walking along the trail. searching.
terry
(calling)
sam?
no reply. her 
words sound hollow in the empty forest as they keep moving, passing behind huge 
pine trees that obscure them from view.
a soft breeze 
rises up and hisses through the trees.
