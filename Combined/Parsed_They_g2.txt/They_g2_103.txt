terry is moving 
at a swift pace. she keeps looking back over her shoulder as julia tries to keep 
up. rain drenches them.
julia
what the hell 
is going on? where's sam?
terry
he's dead.
this almost 
sends julia reeling. her mouth falls open.
julia
what?
terry
there's three 
things you should remember. three things.
julia
what happened 
to sam?
terry
first, whenever 
you see a baby or a kid crying, keep moving. children can sense them. that's 
your warning.
julia
warning against 
who?
terry
second, they 
can control anything electrical or mechanical. lamps. cars. phones. 
julia
terry, you're 
not making any sense.
terry
third -- they 
can change things. they can make you disappear. 
julia
tell me what 
happened to sam.
terry
i am telling 
you.
(terrified)
they took him. 
they made him disappear.
julia stops 
walking. speechless.
