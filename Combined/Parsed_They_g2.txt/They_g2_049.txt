int. cabin - 
living room - night
soft rock seeps 
from a pair of portable compact disc player speakers. paul removes a lid of 
grass and some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint. everyone looks pretty 
toasted. cardboard boxes and candles are everywhere.
sam is sitting 
off to himself. he's still drawing on his pad. julia is reading one of the books 
from the library.
julia
(takes 
a hit)
monsters. 
symbols and dream images. now you see, i don't agree with that. i think 
everything has some kind of physical representation. people can't just come up 
with this stuff.
paul
you did a good 
job last night.
julia hands him 
the metal object from the closet.
julia
and this? what 
do you make of this?
paul
where'd you 
find it?
julia
in the closet 
you didn't leave open.
terry
what's she 
talking about?
paul
(wearisome)
my girlfriend 
believes in the boogeyman.
julia
i never said it 
was the boogeyman. maybe it's some primeval energy that causes a response in 
human beings. this could be the physical representation of that energy.
paul
julia. it's 
piece of shit.
terry
i disagree.
julia turns 
hopefully to terry --
julia
yes?
terry
it's the 
physical representation of a piece of shit.
pot-induced 
laughter. julia takes back the object.
julia
you're not 
being objective about this. have either of you ever been scared? really 
scared?
paul
i'm scared 
right now that you've smoked too much.
julia
paul ...
paul
okay. sure. 
i've been really scared.
julia
like when?
beat.
paul
maybe when we 
hit the dog.
sam looks 
unsettled.
sam
you mean 
this?
sam tosses his 
sketch pad into the center of the floor. everyone leans forward, getting a good 
look at sam's detailed drawing of --
the animal leg 
...
completely 
fleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone. almost as 
accurate as a photograph.
sam 
(cont'd)
that thing we 
hit on the road. it wasn't a dog. it wasn't some primeval force, either.
(then)
it was a 
monster.
julia picks up 
the drawing as paul peers over her shoulder. the picture looks particularly 
unsettling in the flickering firelight.
it almost looks 
alive.
