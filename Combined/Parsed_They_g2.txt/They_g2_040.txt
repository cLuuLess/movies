int. cabin - 
living room - day
shrrriiiippp. 
packing tape is pulled back from a roll.
julia finishes 
taping up a cardboard box. terry is packing some books into another box of her 
own.
terry
you thought there was a monster in the room? and 
you admitted it?
julia
i didn't know 
what else to say.
terry
advice. when 
you don't know what else to say, you lie.
julia
but i really 
did hear something.
terry
you're worse 
than my boyfriend.
julia looks 
towards the front door.
sam is sitting 
on the porch steps, sketching on his pad, oblivious to everything around 
him.
julia
he's in his own 
world, isn't he?
terry
that's an 
understatement. i have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the question for 
this trip.
this sparks 
something in julia. she hesitates, looking through an open doorway where paul 
can be seen packing some clothes. julia speaks to terry in confidence.
julia
do you 
fantasize about other people?
terry
if i haven't 
yet, i probably will by the time we're ready to leave.
hesitant 
beat.
julia
i've been 
fantasizing about a guy.
terry
anyone we 
know?
julia
blond. good 
looking. nice body.
terry
i'd like to 
know that.
julia
(hushed)
he has a 
superman tattoo on his shoulder.
terry's mouth 
drops. the girls move closer together.
terry
no.
julia
yes.
terry
no.
julia
yes.
terry
when did this 
start?
julia
sam's party. i 
walked out of the bathroom and he was changing out of his suit. he lost his tie, 
his shirt ... and then he spotted me.
terry
what did you 
say? keep going?
julia
i got out of 
there. but i've been fantasizing about him ever since.
terry
fuck yeah. 
power to the people.
julia
but paul is the 
perfect boyfriend. top to bottom. he's gorgeous. he's smart. he's gonna be a 
doctor.
terry
(continuing)
he never gets 
upset about anything ...
julia
what the hell 
is wrong with me?
terry
it's just a 
fantasy.
julia
yeah, but when 
i made love to paul on grad night ... i thought of him.
terry 
stares.
terry
wow.
julia
i know. don't 
tell paul about this. i'd rather not test the whole "he never gets upset about 
anything" part.
terry
are you 
okay?
julia
i don't know. i 
think i'm flipping out. seeing things in pictures. thinking that there's a 
monster in my closet.
terry
(rising)
you're being 
too sensitive. we woke up with our closet wide open and i'm not upset about 
it.
julia 
reacts.
julia
your closet was 
open?
terry
having to wash 
my hair without an all-natural conditioner. that upsets me.
she walks out. 
julia sits quietly in the living room, left alone with her own puzzled 
thoughts.
