rover - day
julia is 
sitting behind the wheel. navigating traffic.
paul sits on 
the passenger side, leaning against the window, his face pressed against the 
glass. somber and weak.
through the 
windshield
the twisted 
remains of a car accident has brought everything to a near standstill. police 
are everywhere. an ambulance is parked along the curb, lights flashing.
julia leans 
forward to get a better look.
julia's pov
a teen accident 
victim presses a white towel against his thigh. blood gushes from it. a huge 
metal rod sticks out of his leg.
