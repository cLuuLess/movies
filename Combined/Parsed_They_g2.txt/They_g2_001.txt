int. bedroom - 
day
tiny golden 
wheels and gears turning lazily upon metal rods. mechanical pieces. small and 
intricate. glittering in the sunlight.
reveal
the gears are 
turning within an antique desk clock sitting on a book shelf, a small pendulum 
swinging back and forth behind the glass housing.
the room is 
barren except for a pair of open suitcases and a bed that's been stripped. 
sitting on the mattress is ...
julia levin 
...
smart and 
clever. dressed in a graduation gown and staring out the window. she seems to be 
lost in thought, immobile, until the bedroom door swings open and ...
connor levin, 
aged seventeen and wearing a suit and tie, steps inside.
connor
dad says we 
gotta get moving. we're late.
julia
i'm getting 
ready.
connor
you're sitting 
on the bed.
julia
(dryly)
thanks for 
clearing that up. i'll be right down.
he steps 
out.
julia takes a 
framed picture out of her suitcase -- a candid shot of herself standing with her 
mother, forties, a healthy and vibrant woman.
julia (cont'd)
sure do miss 
you.
above her, a 
ceiling fan rotates. creating a soft humming.
