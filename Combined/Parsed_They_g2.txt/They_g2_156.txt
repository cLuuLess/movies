int. subway 
station - platform - night
julia runs 
directly parallel to the subway platform. the lights alongside of her start 
flickering and go out, one by one, as she advances.
the hissing and 
screaming continues to rise.
she reaches the 
opposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform, pulling herself up. the platform 
goes dark.
appearing out 
of the far tunnel are a dozen dark shapes, scampering along the walls and 
running on all fours across the tracks. their characteristics barely 
visible.
julia kicks 
back as the shrieking things bear down on her, yellow eyes flaring in the dark, 
metal teeth flashing.
julia tries to 
run for the escalator, but the things cover the walls behind the tracks. ready 
to spring.
finally, one of 
the monsters does leap towards her ...
and is smashed 
to bits by an approaching bart train.
reducing the 
monster to a few vestiges of scattered metal. the other creatures on the tracks 
are also run down.
julia watches 
as the train rumbles past. and then, silence.
nothing is left 
except for a few swirling newspapers. the lights flicker and come back to 
life.
rising up to 
her feet, rescued from death by chance, julia starts backing towards the 
escalator. her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns and races 
up.
