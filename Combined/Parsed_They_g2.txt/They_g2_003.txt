ext. university 
of california, los angeles - campus - day
students 
dressed in graduation caps and gowns are gathered on the campus grounds.
julia stands by 
herself, taking pictures with a professional nikon camera. she focuses the 
camera upon ...
terry alba, 22, 
beautiful and sexy. very particular and demanding. she smiles perfectly as julia 
snaps the picture. but her boyfriend, sam burnside, cute and mischievous, 
sporting pink hair and loud clothes, makes a face.
winding her 
film, julia searches a moment, then smiles. raising her camera lens, she snaps a 
picture of ...
paul loomis 
...
early twenties. 
dark hair. strapping and perfectly handsome. he wears a blue and gold striped 
tie with his starched white shirt and graduation gown.
he kisses her. 
passionate and gentle.
paul

up?
julia
ready to move 
in. i'll be storing some of the stuff you've already got. television. cd player. 
microwave.
paul
(suggestively)
bed.
julia smiles at 
him.
julia
bed.
paul
med school 
doesn't start until august. at least not for the freshmen, so we've got plenty 
of time to see europe, take the car trip up north ...
julia
i hope it won't 
be a drag. there's a lot of stuff to move out of my mother's cabin.
paul
our friends 
will be there. it'll be fun.
julia
i hope so.
beat.
paul
you okay?
julia
tense.
paul
would it help 
if i massaged your breasts?
julia
no.
paul
because it 
would help me.
julia
(stifling 
laughter)
maybe 
later.
the students 
start forming into lines.
julia (cont'd)
hey, i saw your 
mom and kid sister. where's your dad?
beat.
paul
he's not 
coming.
julia
but it's your 
graduation.
paul shrugs 
again. a brief sting of hurt on his face.
paul
wasn't a good 
enough reason in high school either.
paul looks 
away. julia knows how painful this is and won't insult him by trying to diminish 
it.
julia smiles 
and runs her finger across his tie knot.
julia
i like your 
tie. ucla colors.
paul
school spirit. 
i am a bruin.
the lines start 
moving towards the stadium. hundreds of cheers rise up from the graduating 
students.
as she walks, a 
sound draws julia's attention. standing on the lawn is a small boy, no more than 
four years-old, sobbing and clinging to his mother's legs.
julia stops 
walking as she gazes at the child. the line comes to a halt behind her.
paul 
(cont'd)
julia. we can't 
graduate unless you move.
julia
sorry.
she stalks 
walking again. paul puts his arms around her.
