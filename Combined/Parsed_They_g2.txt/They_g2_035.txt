int. kitchen - 
night
terry is 
sitting on the counter, twirling her hair and chatting on a cell phone. julia 
enters the kitchen.
terry
(on 
the phone)
i'm not 
kidding, dana. there's no phone.
(beat)
there's a jack 
and the phone line works, but there's no phone. uh-huh. paul was 
able to get on the internet. i'm using his cell.
julia
(quietly)
i need you to 
look at something.
terry nods.
terry
hold on.
julia
here.
julia holds out 
the picture. terry looks it over briefly.
terry
(polite)
nice 
picture.
she gets back 
to her phone conversation.
terry (cont'd)
i'm back.
(beat)
i don't know if 
he has any free minutes, but he definitely won't after this conversation. 
uh-huh. thank god for airtouch.
frustrated, 
julia takes the picture and leaves the kitchen.
