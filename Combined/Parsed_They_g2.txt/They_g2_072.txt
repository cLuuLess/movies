ext. palm 
reader's booth - night
paul approaches 
the booth.
an 
african-american woman in her mid-forties, tess, sits behind the counter. loose 
and upbeat. wearing more colors in her clothing than even a rainbow could 
provide.
paul
can you read my 
palm?
she grins.
tess
you got five 
bucks?
