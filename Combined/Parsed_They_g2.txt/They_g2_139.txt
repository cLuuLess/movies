ext. subway 
station entrance - stairs - night
paul is nowhere 
to be found. the stairs are empty.
julia
paul?!
julia looks 
around desperately. she can't find him in the crowds on the sidewalks. she turns 
and looks down the stairs towards the open entryway to the subway system.
paul is walking 
through the entryway. a friend with him is patting him on the shoulder. just 
after paul has disappeared through the entryway, the friend turns around.
it's sam.
his lips are 
parched, pitch black eyes bulging, his features somehow more twisted and 
unfamiliar. his face twitches as he stares coldly at julia, and he runs.
small pieces of metal drop from sam's pants 
legs as he disappears through the entryway.
julia 
(cont'd)
paul!
she frantically 
rushes down the stairs.
julia (cont'd)
that's not 
sam!!! paul!!!
she rushes 
through the entryway.
