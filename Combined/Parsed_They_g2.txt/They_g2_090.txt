ext. forest - 
day
a darker spot 
enclosed by pine trees. a few birds are singing overhead.
paul enters the 
forest, pushing back branches, following the trail of discarded metal until he 
freezes ... his eyes staring directly ahead at ...
clumps of black 
skin ...
hanging from 
branches. scattered on the ground. like the skin of a snake which has been 
shed.
paul is 
completely unsettled. he kneels down, picking up a flap of skin from the ground, 
peeling it away from a steel rod dripping with oozing slime. holds it up. it's 
still black in color but almost transparent in the murky light.
the wind hisses 
through the trees, mussing paul's hair.
paul drops the 
piece of skin on the ground.
the birds 
abruptly stop singing in unison. the wind ceases.
paul looks 
around the forest. the sudden quiet has got him spooked. his arms and legs 
stiffen. paul can't even bring himself to move or breathe ...
until something 
drops on his shoulder ...
paul freaks and 
whirls around, grabbing his shoulder to find
a piece of skin 
...
clinging to 
him. he rips it off and sprints for the footpath.
