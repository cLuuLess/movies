int. cabin - 
hallway - day
julia is 
walking down the hallway. she happens to pass the bathroom door which is 
slightly open.
julia's pov
within the 
bathroom. the blond student is toweling off. completely naked. the tattoo 
plainly visible on his shoulder. his eyes lock on hers.
julia reacts, 
and runs straight into paul. she jumps.
julia
jesus. you 
scared me.
paul
i'm sorry.
julia
it's okay. i 
wasn't looking.
paul
i'm going for a 
run.
julia
okay. see you 
when you get back.
(remembers)
oh, paul? don't 
leave the closet door open anymore, all right?
paul
(confused)
huh?
julia
the closet. 
last night. you left it open.
paul
i closed it 
after i got my sweatshirt.
julia
did not.
paul
serious. i 
thought you opened it.
julia
wasn't me.
a moment.
paul
well damn, 
julia. your monster isn't just noisy, he's also inconsiderate.
he kisses her 
on the cheek and takes off. julia stands alone in the empty hallway, a chill 
running down her spine.
