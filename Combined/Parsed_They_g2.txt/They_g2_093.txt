int. bathroom - 
night
julia enters 
the bathroom. paul is retching and coughing into the toilet. hair plastered to 
his forehead. pale as death. shaking badly.
julia
paul? what's 
wrong?
paul
(feeble)
sick.
she goes to 
him. rubs his shoulders as he coughs again.
julia
oh baby ...
julia brushes 
the hair from his forehead. she freezes.
just above his 
temple is a scab. no bigger than the head of an eraser. identical to the one on 
julia's finger.
julia (cont'd)
paul? where did 
this come from?
paul
what?
julia
this scab.
julia runs her 
finger over the scab. paul immediately reels from her touch, pain shooting 
through his head, furious.
paul
jesus! fuck!
julia is 
shocked by the severity of his reaction.
julia
i'm sorry.
paul holds his 
head tight. almost near tears. fighting pain.
paul
just don't 
touch it.
julia
how long has it 
been there?
paul
ever since my 
head started to hurt.
(then)
i think i'm 
hallucinating.
julia
what did you 
see?
paul
skin ... like 
it was shed ... and all of these metal pieces ...
julia is 
terribly concerned now. his description frightens her, but she maintains a 
visage of calm.
julia
do you want to 
see a doctor? i know there's one in santa mira.
paul
i can see a 
doctor in los angeles.
(then)
look, i want to 
get out of here, okay? let's go home.
beat.
julia
okay.
she squeezes 
his shoulder and walks into --
