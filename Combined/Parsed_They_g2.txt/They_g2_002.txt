ext. westwood - 
apartment building - day
julia walks out 
of the building where her father, guy levin, an older man with a kind face, 
waits. connor is checking his reflection in the car window, adjusting his tie, 
fussing with his hair.
guy
you ready?
julia
all set. i 
packed up everything.
(remembering)
oh, except 
mom's clock -- i think there's something wrong with it. it's not telling the 
right time.
guy
i'll get it 
fixed. probably just needs a few new parts.
guy smiles at 
julia for a moment. very warmly.
guy (cont'd)
you look just 
like your mother.
julia is 
momentarily uncomfortable. but she recovers, smiles and kisses her father on the 
cheek.
julia
we'll be 
late.
