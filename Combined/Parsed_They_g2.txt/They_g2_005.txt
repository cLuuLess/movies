ext. sam's 
house - back porch - day
sitting between 
a pair of open french doors is "the gang" consisting of julia and paul and terry 
and sam. they throw around conversation, ignoring the party.
terry
it's secluded? 
nobody said anything to me about the cabin being secluded.
julia
i said it was a 
cabin in the woods. i thought seclusion was a given.
terry
i'm no good out 
in the woods. you know what lives in the woods? animals that sting. animals that 
bite.
paul
so avoid the 
animals.
julia
i really 
appreciate you guys helping me. i couldn't move everything alone.
sam
hey, it's our 
last chance to be together. terry and i are excited.
(turns)
aren't we, 
ter?
she's not 
excited.
terry
can i bring my 
cotton bedsheets to the cabin? if i try to sleep in anything but cotton, i get 
hives.
julia
whatever makes 
you happy.
sam grabs a 
large drawing pad from the steps. he opens it.
sam
speaking of 
which, i've got your graduation gift. as specified.
julia
let's see.
sam holds up a 
sketch of clark kent changing to superman.
sam
like it?
julia
it's great. 
thanks sam.
paul checks out 
the drawing. his nose crinkles.
paul
superman? why'd 
you want a drawing of superman? 
julia
he's very 
attractive.
paul
(staring)
you're 
kidding.
julia
no.
paul
he's not even 
real.
julia
i think most 
women tend to wonder if superman is super in every way.
terry
i don't.
paul
you see. there 
goes your argument.
terry
(thoughtfully)
but spiderman 
has a nice ass.
off everyone's 
look --
terry (cont'd)
what?
