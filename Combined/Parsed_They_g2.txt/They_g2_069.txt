ext. santa mira 
- park - day
a warm summer 
afternoon. the entire town has congragated in a park with a breathtaking view of 
the ocean. music and noise. a huge banner draped over the street reads ...
santa mira 
celebrates the 45th annual founder's day festival
julia navigates 
her way past the booths and thrill rides that have been erected on the lawn. she 
watches some passersby.
julia's pov ... 
as a mother talks on a cell phone while her six year-old daughter tugs at her 
sleeve. trying to get her attention. the mother keeps pushing the child away as 
she talks.
julia observes 
this scene until she hears ...
woman's voice 
(o.s.)
i'm your 
mother.
julia steps out 
of the crowd. searches for the voice.
a homeless 
woman is shadowing a college-age girl walking with her boyfriend. they're trying 
to ignore her.
homeless 
woman
i'm your mother 
... i'm your mother ... i'm your mother ...
the couple 
walks faster. the homeless woman is left behind.
homeless 
woman (cont'd)
(futile)
i'm your mother 
...
julia stares 
helplessly.
