int. cabin - 
guest bedroom - day
paul struggles 
through the aperture, slipping underneath a mattress that's been placed against 
the door, and stumbles into the room.
the bedroom is a disaster area.
clothes and 
smashed glass cover the floor. mirrors have been shattered. most of the 
furniture and portions of the bed have been piled in front of the door, creating 
an almost impassible barricade. the window is wide open, the curtains billowing 
in the breeze.
julia and terry 
make their way into the room. stupefied.
paul
careful of the 
glass. don't step on it.
total silence. 
the group stares at the room. taking it in. trying to comprehend it.
julia
what 
happened?
paul
(frozen)
you got me.
