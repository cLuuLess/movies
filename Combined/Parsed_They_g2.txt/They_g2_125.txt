int. coffee 
shop - night
a plate smashes 
on the floor.
julia is jolted 
out of her thought, looks over to find a waiter picking up the pieces. the 
lights flicker in the shop. this unnerves julia completely. she starts gathering 
the photographs together.
she becomes 
aware of the pain in her finger again. looks at the scab.
julia
(a 
whisper)
terry's legs 
... paul's headaches ...
a thought 
crashes like thunder in her head.
julia (cont'd)
oh no ...
julia quickly 
grabs a knife from the table. she gets up and walks straight to the ladies 
restroom.
