ext. san 
francisco - coffee house - late afternoon
a young college 
student is typing on his powerbook, oblivious to the transient sitting on the 
sidewalk, head buried in his knees, a sign at his feet reading "help me."
close on the 
powerbook. a soft whirring noise 
seeping from the computer as the student types.
the whirring 
becomes the humming of machines.
the range rover 
appears on the street and moves past.

(v.o.)
they take away 
your identity. people stop remembering you. your place in society vanishes.
