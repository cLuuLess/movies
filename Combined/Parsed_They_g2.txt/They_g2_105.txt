julia is behind 
the wheel. terry is devouring a cigarette.
terry
that's how they 
get you. by making people not even care about you anymore.
julia
did you try 
sam's parents? did you get the right number this time?
terry
the number i 
called at the bus station was his parents.
(cryptic)
we didn't hit a 
dog on the road.
julia
but i saw 
it.
terry
they switched 
bodies.
julia
who are "they?" 
a cult? killers?
terry starts 
laughing to herself. tears welling in her eyes. hopeless. terrified.
terry
you have no 
idea. no idea what you're dealing with.
(then)
they don't even 
belong here. they're like ... like machines. that's what sam said. like 
machines with all this skin and moving parts.
julia
they're 
machines?
terry
monsters. 
they're monsters, julia.
julia stops at 
a light.
a young guy 
crosses the street in front of them. he's just a yuppie with a cell phone. but 
terry stiffens in her seat, watching him suspiciously.
then, almost as 
an aside, he winks at her.
terry (cont'd)
drive.
julia
i can't. 
there's a red.
terry
then make a 
right. just keep driving.
julia is 
growing frightened by terry's paranoia.
