ext. santa mira 
- park - night
julia is 
wandering through a maze of shooting galleries. she searches through the crowds 
of teenagers and children at the booths. finally, she locates ...
paul ...
approaching her 
with a large teddy bear under his arm.
julia
where did you 
go?
paul
basketball 
toss. i won this for you.
julia smiles at 
the bear.
julia
you sure you 
want to give him up?
paul
(nice 
smile)
i think he'd 
crowd my barbie collection.
&nbsp;
julia kisses 
him. he kisses her back and winces in pain.
julia
you okay?
paul
head still 
hurts.
julia
need some 
aspirin?
paul
already took 
some. i'll be okay.
paul notices 
that they've wandered into a row of psychic and tarot card booths.
paul (cont'd)
hey, look. want 
to get your palm read?
julia
as long as 
you're feeling up to it.
paul
i am. come 
on.
julia spots 
another booth with a sign overhead: "the past through possessions."
julia
just a minute. 
you go to the palm reader. i want to check out this one.
paul
"the past 
through possessions?"
(unimpressed)
scam city.
julia
and palm 
reading isn't?
she's got him 
there.
paul
all right. i'll 
meet you over there.
julia
thanks.
she kisses him 
quickly. they split up.
