int. coffee 
shop - restroom - night
cramped and 
dirty. julia holds her finger over the sink.
with the point 
of the knife's blade, she begins digging into her finger. the pain is immediate. 
julia grimaces, tears forming in her eyes, as the wound blossoms bright red.
blood drips into the sink. 
julia drops the 
knife into the sink and pinches the wound. squeezing hard.
a speck of metal flashes inside the 
wound.
julia continues 
squeezing, tears rolling, fingernails digging into the wound as ...
the tip of a 
metal splinter pushes up through the blood. 
julia starts 
pulling it out of her finger. the splinter rises from the wound ... and rises 
... and rises ...
more blood 
spatters into the sink.
julia is 
gasping and crying as the pain becomes excruciating. the glittering splinter is 
five inches long and growing.
the splinter is pulled out. it's seven inches 
long.
julia drops the 
splinter into the sink. she moves away from the counter, back towards the living 
room, unbelieving, horrified ...
she stumbles 
towards the door.
