int. cabin - 
living room - morning
julia is 
startled awake and groggily looks around the room. paul and terry are still in 
the process of getting up.
paul
look who's 
up.
(smiles)
you sleep 
well?
julia stares 
back. she looks pretty freaked.
paul (cont'd)
uh-oh.
terry
i didn't sleep 
well either. i dreamt that all these cockroaches were eating my legs.
paul
you want to 
trade? right before i woke up, my head exploded and all these snakes came 
out.
terry
where's 
sam?
paul
probably went 
to bed.
terry nods as 
she rises to her feet.
terry
i need a hairbrush. and a 
facial.
she stumbles 
into the hallway. paul turns to julia.
paul
you had 
nightmares too?
julia
worst ones i've 
had in a long time. i thought i was hallucinating.
paul winces and 
rubs his temples.
julia (cont'd)
what's 
wrong?
paul
headache. i'll 
be fine.
terry briskly 
walks out the hallway. she looks alarmed.
terry
you guys. 
something's wrong.
