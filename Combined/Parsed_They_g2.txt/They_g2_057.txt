int. asylum - 
surgical room - night (dream seq.)
julia steps 
into the surgical room.
the little girl 
from sam's party is resting on a gurney. her small body is clamped down with 
metal bands. her blonde curls draped over the edge. her eyes open and staring at 
nothing.&nbsp; 
something else lurches into the room. moving 
in the shadows. a surgeon enclosed in metal braces and holding a pair of 
alien-looking shears in his hands. 
the surgeon opens the shears over the girl's 
forehead.
julia tries to 
scream. no sound comes out. the shears close.
several drops 
of blood ... then a blonde curl ... hit the tile floor.
the sound of the machines is interrupted by 
glass breaking.
