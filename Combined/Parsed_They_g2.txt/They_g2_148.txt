int. main 
hallways - continuous
the steam parts 
to reveal a dark space. cold and damp.
julia moves 
into the main hallway, stumbling through a hallway that can best be described as 
a living nightmare. mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned together 
into a wall, pulsating with the heartbeat of machines that saturates the entire 
hallway.
steam jets into 
the hallway intermittently from the pipes. creating great clouds.
julia is beyond 
horrified. her face registers a numbness. complete and total astonishment.
human bones and 
body parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that it's 
impossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical begins.
she enters 
another corridor. her face is struck by a jet of hissing steam.
she presses 
onward. slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor.
another blast 
of steam.
something leaps 
out of the middle of it.
julia whirls 
back around a corner, pressing flat against the wall as a black shape moves 
through the steam. unidentifiable features. movements that suggest nothing by 
chaos and madness.
the shape 
hisses and croaks in the hallway.
julia waits. 
she doesn't even breathe. the hissing stops.
she gradually 
turns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood.
close on 
julia's eyes
as she looks 
around the corner. the shape has disappeared.
carefully she 
keeps going forward. drenched in water and sweat. slipping through the steam 
clouds that mask another entrance.
