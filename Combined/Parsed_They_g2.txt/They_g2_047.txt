int. library - 
reading room - day
the stacks are 
deserted and still. julia sits at a reading table, flipping through a book, 
surrounded by long rows of bookshelves.
intercut - the 
book
julia flips 
from page to page, allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings: vampires, 
werewolves, witches, a ghastly thing crawling out from under a maiden's bed.
on julia
as she puts 
down the book and grabs another from a stack on the table. she opens it and 
starts paging through.
close on - the 
book
as julia finds 
a drawing of a sleeping child. just beyond the bed is an open closet door, the 
horrid face a monster watching the child from within.
julia shivers 
down to her soul. a familiar feeling of late.
a slight 
squeaking catches her attention. she looks across the reading room to find 
--
a young boy
ten years old. 
tow-haired. sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite her. he's 
wearing a superman shirt.
he smiles 
timidly and waves. julia waves back.
a thump behind 
her. julia turns and looks over her shoulder. she barely catches sight of a 
shadow slipping across the wall in the stacks.
the scraping of 
chair legs against the cold floor. julia looks back towards where the boy was 
sitting. the chair is pushed back and empty.
another 
thumping in the stacks. then silence.
a feeling of 
anxiety washes over julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves.
