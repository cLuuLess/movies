int. cabin - 
guest bedroom - day
julia is 
cleaning the mess in the room. she's just finished tossing a few shards of 
broken glass into a garbage bag when she flinches and draws her index finger 
back.
the finger has 
a scab on it. exactly where she cut it in the dream. dried blood marks the 
wound.
