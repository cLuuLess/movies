ext. corner 
store - night
paul stops 
outside, running his fingers through his hair, digging them into his skull.
paul
(shaking 
his head)
that's not 
possible ... that's not possible ...
a shape grabs 
his shoulder. paul spins around.
a homeless bag 
lady stands behind him. pleading eyes. dishevelled and caked with grime. she 
holds up the drooping sleeve where a hand once was.
bag lady
help me. they 
took my hand.
paul stumbles 
back. horrified.
bag lady (cont'd)
(weeping)
they took my 
hand ...
paul turns and 
starts running. faster than he's ever run in his life. disappearing down the 
dark street.
