ext. forest 
road - night
the hazard 
lights are switched on. paul walks around to the front of the rover.
the bumper is 
dented.
paul
look at that. 
there's a couple thousand dollars out of my wallet.
terry
you can 
probably get someone to pop it back.
paul
sure. for a 
couple hundred dollars.
sam looks down 
the road. he can barely make out a large form resting lifeless in the ditch.
he starts 
walking towards it.
julia
i'm sorry about 
your car, paul ...
paul
(begrudging)
yeah, well. 
shit happens.
the 
conversation becomes distant as sam walks slowly up the road, moving past the 
yellow flashing hazard lights which click rhythmically ... click, click, click 
...
sam approaches 
the ditch. darkness is all around.
.... click ... 
click ... click ...
he kneels down 
alongside the body of the animal. very little is visible of the corpse except 
for its dark, mangled form sprawled across the dirt.
sam picks up a 
stick and pokes at the body. nothing happens.
he pokes at the 
corpse again.
the hind legs 
of the corpse suddenly twitch. a reflex action. sam leaps back. the life nearly 
scared out of him.
a flap of 
hairless skin slides away from one of the animal's hind legs. sam leans forward 
to get a better look, becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated.
sam
hey guys!
paul
what?
sam
take a look at 
this.
julia
is it a 
dog?
sam glances at 
the dead corpse and back to his friends again. he looks shaken.
sam
i don't 
know.
the rest of the 
group moves down the road. a weird unease has started to settle in.
paul and julia 
kneel down in front of the corpse. it's almost unrecognizable. the darkness 
smothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the body's 
features.
paul
it looks like a 
dog to me.
sam
did you see the 
leg?
paul
what about 
it?
sam takes the 
stick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look. the group 
leans forward.
a deep bleeding 
wound has been exposed. through the torn flesh and blood pumping over charcoal 
skin, the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight. but intermingled with 
the animal's skeleton are ...
pieces of metal 
...
glittering and 
clean. a series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone that have 
grown together.
sam
ever seen 
anything like that?
paul
no.
sam
it looks like 
steel. like someone put steel into its body.
paul
i don't think 
it was put in there. it looks like it grew that way.
julia
that's 
impossible. what kind of animal has steel in its skeleton?
terry steps 
forward tentatively.
terry
what are you 
looking at?
julia
are you sure 
it's dead?
paul
come on, honey. 
it's a dog. not a zombie.
sam
julia? where's 
your camera?
julia
it's in the 
car.
paul
i've got 
it.
paul races back 
to the range rover and opens the passenger door. he withdraws julia's 
camera.
julia takes a 
step back into the middle of the road. the wind is sifting through the trees, 
creating a soft hissing noise as the branches dance and twist in the 
shadows.
paul returns 
and hands the camera to sam.
sam
you want to 
turn it over?
paul
i'm not 
touching it.
sam kneels 
down. he points the camera and shoots.
the camera 
flash cuts through the darkness and falls upon the corpse. but only for a 
millisecond of clarity.
twisted metal. 
skin. appendages. madness.
both of the 
young men stand frozen, thunderstruck, staring down at the misshapen shape in 
front of them. a long period of amazed silence follows.
sam
that's wrong. 
that's all wrong.
paul shakes his 
head.
paul
that's not a 
dog.
terry
(stunned)
what were those 
things coming out of its back?
paul starts 
recoiling. his stomach is getting weak.
paul
that's not a 
dog.
the cool summer 
wind whistles through the trees around them.
sam
(sickened)
that doesn't 
even make sense.
julia
paul ...
paul looks over 
at her.
julia (cont'd)
let's get in 
the car.
sam
we need some 
flashlights.
terry
(hushed)
screw the 
flashlights.
sam
what the hell 
is it?
paul
dude. we're 
outta here.
julia and paul 
walk briskly to the range rover. sam and terry follow them, glancing back over 
their shoulders.
sam
what the hell 
is it?!
paul tosses the 
camera into the rover's back seat. he slams the door shut. julia opens the front 
passenger door.
a soft thumping 
from the woods. almost like footsteps.
julia
get in the 
car.
julia hops into 
the front seat and slams her door.
