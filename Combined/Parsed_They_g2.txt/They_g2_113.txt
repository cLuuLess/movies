int. apartment 
- living room - continuous
terry leaves 
the bedroom, carrying the suitcase, and walks straight towards the front door. 
she collects her keys and her cell phone from the table.
the lights in the apartment simultaneously go 
out.
terry is caught 
entirely off guard. she spins around to face the living room. nobody's there. 
nothing.
something bangs 
at the front door. a steady pounding. the banging goes on for a few seconds and 
then stops dead.
terry's 
breathing quickens. she puts the suitcase down.
a crack of 
thunder reverberates outside.
moving with the 
cautious steps of a small child, she walks towards the front door. foot by foot. 
the only sound is her frightened breathing. she arrives at the peephole and 
looks out into the empty hall.
something 
stares back at her through the peephole.
moving right in 
front of the door. one of its yellow eyes piercing through ... surrounded by 
midnight skin pierced with metal bolts and rods.
terry screams 
her lungs out.
the door 
rattles like it's going to break off its hinges. something slams repeatedly 
against the wood.
terry tears 
through the apartment, feet pounding. she rushes into the bedroom.
the front door 
in the living room breaks open.
