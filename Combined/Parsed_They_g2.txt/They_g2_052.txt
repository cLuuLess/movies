int. asylum - snake pit - night (dream 
seq.)
there is no 
sound except for the humming of machines.
julia stumbles 
through the snake pit. mental patients stagger around her. many of them are 
dressed like homeless people. staring into space. bodies twitching and gnawing 
on their fingers. lying in their own urine.
julia looks 
skyward towards a screen that doubles for a ceiling. dark figures are standing 
on the screen, looking down at them.
a pair of 
orderlies gently take julia's arm and lead her out of the snake pit.
julia looks at 
the wall as she walks.
julia's pov - 
shadows move across the wall. almost like ripples in water.
but the shadows gradually become the grotesque 
silhouettes of human body parts -- arms, legs, heads, feet -- hanging and 
rocking gently from hooks
