int. range 
rover - night
the inside of 
the range rover is dark. only the faint glow from the dashboard lights provides 
any ambient illumination. sam and terry are snuggled together in the back seat. 
everything is quiet.
julia is 
thinking. finally, she breaks the silence.
julia
do you believe 
in monsters?
a beat. 
everyone else in the car trades looks.
paul
we've been in 
the car too long.
julia
i'm just 
asking.
paul
like what? the 
boogeyman?
julia
the boogeyman. 
the thing under the bed. the monster hiding in the closet.
terry
what made you 
think of that?
julia
a little girl 
at sam's house. she was convinced there was a monster trying to get her.
paul
you're saying 
you believe her?
julia is 
suddenly on the spot. she backtracks.
julia
of course i 
don't. there are no monsters. not really.
sam
sure there are. 
ted bundy. son of sam.
ed gein.
terry
who was ed 
gein?
sam
he was a mass 
murderer. this old hermit who'd kill people and take the parts he wanted. heads. 
livers. intestines. sex organs.
terry
why did he use 
the parts for?
sam
everything. the 
police found a skull that was used for a soup bowl. faces were stuffed and 
mounted like hunting trophies on the wall. bones were used for furniture.
paul
he also wore 
their skin. like clothes.
terry recoils 
into her seat. grossed out.
terry
sorry i 
asked.
sam
you wanted 
proof. there it is.
julia
but it's not 
like he's a monster under the bed.
sam
so?
julia
so why are kids 
afraid of that? 
sam
because they 
live in a completely different world than we do.
(then)
think about it. 
why do kids pick up on things that we can't? ... bumps in the night? ... 
footsteps in the hallway? ... a thumping inside their closet?
paul
overactive 
imagination.
sam
wrong. perfect 
awareness.
(beat)
kids have a 
perfect awareness of everything around them. every sound. every 
shadow.
everything gets 
quiet.
sam (cont'd)
the boogeyman 
could be real. so could monsters. just because you've never seen them doesn't 
mean they aren't there.
silence. the 
car engine purrs softly. this is starting to make sense. and it's spooky.
paul
all right. i'm 
creeped out. but my bullshit alarm is going off.
sam
you just can't 
handle it.
paul
right. because 
it's bullshit.
julia
serial killers 
aside, my take on this subject is very simple. if i don't have a picture of it 
-- it's not real.
terry
okay, is this 
conversation like a radio station? can we just change the channel? because 
personally, i'd like to get to sleep tonight.
terry has just 
finished saying these words, when --
an animal runs out of the woods into the 
middle of the road. a black shape in the headlights. eyes flashing in the 
dark.
paul
jesus 
christ!
paul slams on 
the brakes. too late.
wham! the range rover smashes into it, 
throwing the shape into a ditch at the side of the road.
the range rover 
swerves and comes to a squealing halt.
inside the 
rover
everyone 
catches their breath. a moment of dead silence.
paul 
(cont'd)
everyone 
okay?
terry
(nods)
we're fine.
julia
what was 
that?
paul
i think it was 
a dog.
julia unlocks 
her door.
julia
we'd better 
check the car.
she steps out 
of the rover. the others follow.
