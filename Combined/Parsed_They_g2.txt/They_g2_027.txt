ext. santa mira 
coastline - beach - day
cloudy and 
overcast. a set of colorless waves crash into the rocks. sam and julia and terry 
walk just beyond the rippling surf, arguing with each other.
sam
i can't get 
over it. that thing looked wrong. completely wrong.
julia
of course it 
looked wrong. paul rammed it with his car.
sam
what about the 
blood? it wasn't red ... it was black -- it was like ... oil coming from 
a busted engine.
julia
i must've 
missed that.
sam
let's find it. cut it up. study 
it.
terry
(measured)
sam, i realize 
that you're an extroverted comic book artist and i'm a neurotic. but it's only 
now at this moment that i'm wondering why we're dating.
sam turns back 
to julia --
sam
i'll pay you to 
take me back.
julia
you don't have 
to pay me. take the car.
sam
the rover's a 
shift. i can only drive an automatic.
julia
ask paul.
sam
he's out 
running. besides, you heard him last night. he'd never do it.
julia stares at 
him.
julia
it's a dead 
animal. 
sam
so come with 
me. you take the pictures this time. if it's just a dead animal, then you're 
right and i'm wrong. but if it's not, we've got a picture of it.
julia
a picture of 
what?
beat.
sam
a monster.
a set of 
foaming waves hiss as they slide along the sand.
julia stands 
with her arms folded. there's something really creepy about it which she doesn't 
want to admit.
julia
monsters don't 
exist. 
sam
what...?
(pause)
sayin' yes ... 
or saying no?
julia stares at 
him, deadpan. sam just stares right back.
