int. corner 
market - night
a small box of 
aspirin are taken from the shelf.
paul tightens 
his fist around the box, shutting his eyes, fighting the excruciating the pain 
in his head. he takes a deep breath and moves to the register.
cashier
need anything 
else?
paul
(weak)
no.
the cashier rings him up.
cashier
four 
thirty-two.
paul flips open 
his wallet. his face drops into shock.
there's nothing 
inside his wallet. no credit cards. no money. no driver's license. not a 
thing.
cashier (cont'd)
something 
wrong?
paul can barely 
speak.
paul
um ... i 
must've brought the wrong wallet. sorry.
paul walks out 
of the store.
