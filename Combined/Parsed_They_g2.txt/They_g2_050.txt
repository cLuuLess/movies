int. cabin - 
living room - night
it's late. the 
fire is dwindling. terry and sam have both passed out. julia relaxes on the 
floor, staring at sam's drawing while resting in paul's lap.
julia
i can't believe 
sam drew this.
paul
i can. he's 
been acting like a freak.
beat.
julia
you think we 
could've been wrong?
paul
about what?
julia
about the dog. 
maybe the next day when sam and i went back to the road ... maybe we found the 
wrong body.
paul
can we drop 
this? please?
julia
i just want to 
know ...
paul
(clipped)
stop.
julia
i just want to 
know what's going on.
paul
nothing's going 
on. here, give me the drawing.
julia
i'm not done 
yet.
paul
your hands are 
shaking. come on, julia. give yourself a break.
she hands the 
drawing pad to him. paul puts it on the couch.
julia
we need to talk 
about this.
paul
tomorrow. just 
relax.
paul begins 
stroking her hair. gently and repeatedly.
julia
just for a 
minute.
julia looks 
really tired. she closes her eyes for a moment as paul's steady breathing fills 
the room. the she opens them, turns her head and gazes at ...
the blond 
student ...
sitting in a 
chair. smoking a cigarette. smiling down at her.
she cranks her 
head and looks deeply into her boyfriend's eyes. he smirks and gently strokes 
her hair.
julia (cont'd)
nice.
paul
(soft)
you're tired. 
go to sleep.
her breathing 
becomes more steady.
in the 
distance, a sound begins to permeate the cabin ...
the sound of 
machines ...
grinding and 
drumming like the churning of a large factory.&nbsp; a calming and soothing noise, drifting 
over ...
dream 
sequence - a series of shots
quick flashes 
of images which are strung together:
(a) a turbine 
driven by a cloud of pumping steam.
(b) the 
superman tattoo on the blond student's shoulder.
(c) a doberman 
running across a road.
(d) a man 
limping along wearing leg braces and using steel crutches.
(e) a woman's 
hands slipping over a young man's bare chest.
(f) a back 
brace being locked into place.
