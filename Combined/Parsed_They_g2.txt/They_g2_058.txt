int. cabin - 
living room - night
julia lurches 
awake.
paul and terry 
are lying immobile on the floor. hundreds of candles have been placed throughout 
the room, bathing the cabin in a dull amber glow.
there is no 
sound.
julia starts to 
rise to her feet. her fingers graze something sharp. she winces and snatches her 
fingers away from ...
a broken wine 
glass ...
julia discovers 
a small ribbon of blood trickling from her index finger. she sucks on it, and 
notices --
sam ...
sitting behind 
the couch. his eyes are intense as he erases something from his drawing pad. 
julia walks around him until she can see the sketch.
the drawing is 
julia's portrait.
sam erases the 
picture, working from the shoulders up.
there is still 
no sound.
julia is 
dumbfounded. she hears a slight noise coming from somewhere in the cabin. a 
small hissing sound. soft and unobtrusive.
julia looks 
around. the sound seemed to come from behind her. but there's nothing in the 
room. her friends are still asleep. sam is concentrating on his drawing.
more hissing. 
unmistakable this time. a diminutive scraping, almost like fingernails raking on 
icy glass, slithering out from a darkened hallway.
she moves 
towards the sound.
