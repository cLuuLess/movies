ext. fast food 
restaurant - parking lot - continuous
the group 
emerges from the restaurant. the parking lot is almost deserted. no people are 
in sight.
julia moves 
leisurely towards the range rover, just ahead of terry and sam -- but she'd walk 
a lot faster if paul's arm weren't draped around her shoulder. she looks tight 
and nervous. her eyes scanning the parking lot.
the cars are 
empty. sidewalk litter dances in the wind.
inside one of the parked cars, a featureless 
shape is sitting behind the wheel. the shape turns and stares at 
them.
everyone piles 
into the range rover. julia throws a nervous glance back at the shape in the 
car.
he's still 
watching them.
everyone piles 
into the car.
