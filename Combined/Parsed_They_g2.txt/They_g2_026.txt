int. cabin - 
basement - night
the basement is 
saturated in a bright red light. julia is developing a photograph within a small 
basin. paul and terry are seated on the stairs. sam is pacing.
sam
how much 
longer?
julia
thirty seconds. 
it's coming out.
sam
i still think 
we should get the body.
we could drive 
out there, haul it into the car ...
paul
i'm not loading 
that thing into my car.
i don't give a 
shit what it is. it's not coming back here.
julia lifts the 
developed picture out of the basin.
julia
done.
she switches on 
the light. the group crowds around her.
sam
what is it? 
what does it look like?
the photograph 
is blurred. the body is indistinguishable.
julia
damn.
sam
what happened 
to the picture?
julia
out of 
focus.
sam
what do you 
mean it's out of focus? i took the picture. the flash went off.
julia
sam, this is a 
professional camera with a zoom lens. you can't just point and shoot.
a quiet moment 
as they stare at the picture.
paul
well, so much 
for that.
sam looks at 
the picture, then at his friends. with a look of somber frustration, sam quietly 
turns and charges up the stairs, taking two at a time.
after he's gone 
...
terry
it's not a big 
deal. whatever it was.
(then)
he'll get over 
it.
