int. cabin - 
bedroom - day
julia pulls out 
their duffle bags and suitcases.
paul's cell 
phone rings on the table. julia snatches up the phone and answers.
julia
hello? ... yes? 
...
(then)
wait a minute 
... slow down, i can't understand what you're saying ...
complete 
astonishment storms julia's face. paul wanders in.
paul
who is it?
julia
it's terry. 
something went wrong.
