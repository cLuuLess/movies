house - hallway - continuous
... and 
freezes. standing within an open bedroom is ...
a blond 
student.
another college 
graduate. tan and attractive. dressed exactly like paul -- identical white 
shirt, gold and blue striped tie. he pulls off his tie and unbuttons his 
shirt.
julia doesn't 
move.
the student 
peels off his shirt. her eyes are drawn to a superman "s" insignia tattooed on 
his shoulder.
the student 
catches sight of julia in the hallway. her face turns bright red immediately. 
she starts to laugh.
he smiles at 
her. a bit flattered. flirting.
student
changing into 
something more formal.
he holds up a 
pair of ripped jeans.
julia backs 
down the hallway. still laughing. embarrassed.
julia
i'm sorry. i 
was just using the ...
(laughs)
really. i'm 
sorry.
student
i'll forgive 
you this once.
she quickly 
leaves.
the blond 
student watches her go. a grin on his face.
