int. range 
rover - late afternoon
terry keeps her 
eyes riveted on the people on the sidewalk. she's practically in tears.
terry
remember when 
we hit that thing with the car? 
(hushed)
it wasn't an 
accident. it was a set-up. they planned it all along.
julia
how do you know 
this?
terry
sam told me. he 
figured everything out.
julia
why are they 
coming after us? what do they want with us?
terry
they have flesh 
and metal parts in their bodies. sometimes they shed what they don't need. but 
other parts keep getting worn out or lost. so they take people constantly to get 
new parts.
julia
(soft)
that's not 
possible.
terry
they wear the 
skin. that's why you don't notice them. half of the time they're wearing 
people's skin. or they're hiding in dark places. alleys. closets.
julia is 
horrified.
julia
terry ... 
please stop.
terry
they take other 
parts too. whatever they need. they're scavengers. no sense of compassion. no 
remorse.
julia
i don't believe 
this.
terry
that's why they 
came after us. they got joey first. at the cabin.
julia is 
dumbfounded. 
julia
joey?
terry
that's what sam 
saw. that's why he left. he woke up and got a look at them -- at what they were 
doing to joey ...
julia
terry ...
terry
stripping him 
... taking his skin off ...
julia pulls 
over to the curb and stops.
julia
who is joey? 
what are you talking about?
terry
(amazed)
you don't 
remember?
julia
no.
terry
there were five 
of us. he came up in his own car. he was paul's best friend -- they always wore 
the same thing for christ sakes.
julia
there were only 
four of us. you. me. paul. sam.
terry is 
shaking now. complete fright.
terry
they got to 
you. they got to you.
julia
nobody got to 
me.
terry starts 
collecting her things.
terry
look, could you 
drop me off at my brother's apartment? i need to pick up some things before i go 
to the airport.
julia
where are you 
going?
terry
to see my 
parents.
julia
you can't just 
leave.
terry starts 
weeping. grabbing her legs and squeezing them.
terry
they put things 
in my legs so they can track me. it hurts.
julia
(very 
concerned)
terry? what can 
i do to help you?
terry takes her 
hand. her eyes pleading.
terry
remember me. 
please remember me.
from the street 
outside the car, the sound of a toddler crying can be heard. terry's head snaps 
around. she stares out the windshield at the screaming child.
terry (cont'd)
they found me 
again.
before julia 
can react, terry bolts from the car.
julia
terry!
julia 
pursues.
