int. san 
francisco - subway station - day
the afternoon 
rush of people trying to get home.
a group of 
three college students come down the escalator into the station. connor is among 
them, now eighteen and wearing a berkeley sweatshirt. his friends are barry and 
mike.
barry
why the hell 
didn't we bring the car?
connor
you wanna pay 
for gas?
barry
better than 
this shit. i hate bart.
mike
he has a point. 
i made the mistake of trying to use the bathroom. what do these people do? stand 
with their ass hanging over the toilet and aim?
connor checks 
his watch.
connor
we're late. 
party started an hour ago.
mike
we'll make 
it.
barry
(trace 
of sarcasm)
yeah connor. 
relax. we might get there right after the kegs dry out.
connor
(resigned)
i should study 
anyway.
a female voice 
calls out from across the platform.
female voice 
(o.s.)
connor?
he turns around 
and scans the crowd, locating a ragged figure that moves quickly towards him. 
with her dirty clothing and sunken eyes, it takes a moment to register. this is 
julia. her skin is pale. her hair is stringy and knotted.
julia
i've been 
looking for you.
connor
what?
barry
(hushed)
great.
mike
just ignore 
her.
julia
they tried to 
get me. several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; but i 
managed to get away. i've always managed to get away.
a train rushes 
into the station. connor is speechless.
connor
i'm ... sorry 
..
julia
but you'll help 
me. you will help me.
connor raises 
his hands and backs towards the train as the doors slide open. his friends are 
already aboard.
connor
i'm sorry.
julia
no, wait ... 
it's julia ... don't you remember?
he gets into 
the train. his friends are laughing. connor turns to his friends with a look of 
smirking disbelief.
&nbsp;connor
how the fuck 
did she know my name?
barry
she heard me 
say it.
connor
jesus 
christ.
julia
(overlapping)
it's julia! i'm 
your sister!
the doors slide 
closed in her face.
