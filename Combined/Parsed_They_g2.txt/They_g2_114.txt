int. apartment 
- bedroom - continuous
terry slams the 
bedroom door and locks it. backs away towards the bed, when ...
a hand reaches 
out from under it ...
grabbing hold 
of her ankle. fused together from rotting flesh, human parts, and metal pieces. 
terry pitches forward, screaming, falling to her hands and knees.
the hand starts 
dragging her under the bed.
terry kicks and 
claws on the floor. somehow manages to free herself from the hand's grip. she 
goes for the window and pulls it open. steps outside.
the entire bed 
is overturned and tossed aside.
