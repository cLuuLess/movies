int. cabin - 
bedroom - night
the door opens. 
julia's stomach rises into her throat. terror floods her face.
resting on the bed is a body bag. so smeared 
with blood that the corpse inside isn't visible except for its massive 
bulk.
something scratches on the body bag from 
inside.
julia's body 
goes rigid. she can't force herself to move.
the body bag is slowly unzipped from the 
inside. stretching down the length of the plastic until the bag is wide open. 
the corpse inside is still hidden. 
as if drawn by 
some alien force, julia moves to the bed. her entire body is shaking.
she reaches out 
and carefully peels back the plastic.
resting within 
the body bag is the little girl. eyes puffed shut. hair slicked with blood. her 
skin is livid. her face is ghostly white and smeared with crimson gore.
julia is frozen 
in place. heart pounding. terrified.
the girl's eyes 
blink open as she shrieks bloody murder.
