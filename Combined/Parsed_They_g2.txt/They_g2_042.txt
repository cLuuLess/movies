int. bedroom 
closet - day
the door slowly 
creaks open. julia stands in the doorway, surveying the closet -- a cluttered 
and claustrophobic space despite its size. clothes draped on hangars. cardboard 
boxes stacked on shelves. shadows.
julia moves 
inside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a switch. 
tick-tick. the bulb stays dark. she tries again.
tick-tick.
the light still 
won't come on.
julia carefully 
looks through some of the clothes. nothing. she kneels down and checks the 
floor.
a long creaking 
behind her. the natural light fades.
julia looks 
over her shoulder, a bit skittish, as the closet door eases back towards the 
doorjamb. but there's nobody there. just the faintest hint of a draft.
julia keeps 
searching through the clutter. moving shoes and boxes out of the way. 
searching.
then, she spots 
something glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet doorway. a 
small object resting in the corner. julia reaches down and picks it up ...
a piece of 
metal ...
small and 
intricate with erratic markings. twisted and strangely ornate. the shape and 
texture of the metal is almost completely alien.
julia holds the 
metal into the light. extremely curious. behind her, a shadow moves ...
crash. julia 
screams, dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box smashes down 
behind her. tumbling from one of the shelves above. old shoes scatter across the 
floor.
julia catches 
her breath. heart pounding.
on the floor, 
the metal object sparkles in the light. a draft hisses through the open closet 
door.
