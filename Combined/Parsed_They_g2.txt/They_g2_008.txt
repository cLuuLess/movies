ext. sam's 
house - back yard - day
julia walks out 
the back door. stifling her laughter.
paul is talking 
with guy on the lawn. julia snaps a picture of them together, winds her film, 
and notices ...
a little girl 
...
sweet and 
innocent. sitting on a bench. motionless.
julia walks 
towards her. the little girl is staring across the lawn at a pool shed. 
transfixed. a group of children are playing on the grass in front of it.
the girl 
becomes aware of julia's presence and turns around.
julia
hi.
girl
(quiet)
hi.
silence.
julia
you sitting 
here all by yourself?
the girl slowly 
nods "yes."
julia (cont'd)
don't you want 
to play with the other kids?
the girls 
shakes her head "no."
julia (cont'd)
want me to 
leave you alone?
the girl shakes 
her head "no."
more 
silence.
julia (cont'd)
want to mix 
this up and ask me something?
the little girl 
notices the camera.
girl
are you taking 
pictures for sam's family?
julia
no, i'm just 
...
(then)
i'm a friend of 
sam's. but i'm also a photographer. i take pictures.
beat.
girl
will you take a 
picture of me?
julia
why?
girl
so you won't 
forget me.
julia
(surprised)
why would i 
forget you?
girl
because they're 
coming for me.
a long beat. 
julia sits next to her.
julia
who is?
girl
the 
monsters.
julia
what 
monsters?
girl
there. behind 
the door.
the girl points 
towards the pool shed. the rusted door of the shed is slightly open. just a 
crack.
julia
those other 
kids don't look too scared.
girl
they should 
be.
beat.
julia
(playing 
along)
so how come 
only you can see them?
the girl leans 
forward and speaks in a hushed whisper.
girl
because i know 
they're real. i used to have a little brother, but they came and got him. 
now my parents say i never had a brother before.
(pause)
soon ... my 
parents won't remember me either.
something about 
the girl's tone of voice is unnerving. as if she's resigned herself to this.
a slight wind 
hisses through the trees. the girl rises.
girl (cont'd)
i gotta go. 
they know i'm talking about them.
julia
wait a 
second.
julia snaps a 
picture of the girl.
julia (cont'd)
feel 
better?
the girl stares 
at her.
girl
are you scared 
of monsters?
julia
no.
beat.
girl
i am.
the girl turns 
and runs across the lawn.
julia is left 
sitting on the bench. she glances over at the pool shed again. raises her camera 
and focuses on the door which is still cracked open.
she snaps the 
picture.
