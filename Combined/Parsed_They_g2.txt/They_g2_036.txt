ext. cabin - 
front porch - night
the air is 
completely still. a hush has fallen. the only sound is the ocean and crickets chirping in the grass.
julia wanders 
outside holding some of the developed photographs from the party. sam is sitting 
on the front steps, working on his drawing.
julia
sam? could you 
look at...
sam looks up 
from his drawing pad.
sam
what?
beat.
julia
never mind.
julia sits on 
the porch glider and looks through the photos. the little girl looking back over 
her shoulder. the blurred shape inside of the shed.
a moment 
passes. julia shuts her eyes as a slight breeze comes up. she slips into a 
dream-like state, calm and relaxed, before opening her eyes to find ...
the blond 
student
sitting back on 
the hood of a sports car. wearing a white tank top undershirt. the tattooed "s" 
insignia visible on his shoulder. bathed in soft moonlight. he even looks good 
in the dark.
their eyes 
meet. smiles are traded between them. the wind sifts gently over the porch.
it's all very 
dream-like.
