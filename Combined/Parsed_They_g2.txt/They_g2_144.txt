int. subway 
tunnel - night
drowned in 
shadows. an unnatural silence fills the tunnel.
julia moves 
cautiously amongst the tracks. eyes scanning the darkness. following the trail 
of discarded metal.
a sharp 
hissing.
julia spins 
around. a few more hissing sounds rise from electrical sparks on the tracks. 
blue light flashes within the tunnel. then, it ceases.
she turns back 
to continue her search, wind sifting through her hair, when she finds --
a large 
hole
at the base of 
the subway wall. julia reaches down and palms a few metal pieces at the base of 
the hole.
she peers 
inside. a dull flickering light flashes within.
julia takes a 
calming breath. she moves into the hole.
