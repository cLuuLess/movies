int. cabin - 
living room - day
paul is sitting 
on the couch, wearing a ucla cross country tank top and tying his shoes. julia 
enters from the basement. she's carrying a stack of developed pictures.
julia
paul, you have 
to see this. the picture came out, but there's something really strange in the 
middle of it. just like the other one of the shed.
he looks at the 
picture.
paul
looks like 
someone on the carousel.
julia
but there's no 
features. it's like a shadow.
paul
so there wasn't 
enough light.
paul rubs his 
forehead. julia is genuinely concerned.
julia
what's the 
matter?
paul
my head feels 
worse.
julia
maybe you 
should lie down.
paul
i have to go 
running.
julia
no you 
don't.
paul
of course i do. 
your body's like a machine. it needs upkeep.
julia
not when you're 
physically ill.
paul
i'll be 
okay.
julia
paul ...
paul
i'll be 
okay.
(about 
the picture)
is that it?
julia
not 
exactly.
(beat)
when i saw this 
picture, i decided to look at the other one. just for comparison's sake.
paul
so?
julia takes out 
another photograph.
julia
i pulled this 
one by mistake. the picture of that little girl from the party.
she hands him 
the picture.
julia (cont'd)
look.
paul's face 
collapses into slack disbelief.
the little girl has disappeared from the 
photo. vanished.
paul turns to 
julia as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of fear and apprehension.
julia (cont'd)
what's going 
on?
this time, he 
doesn't have an answer.
