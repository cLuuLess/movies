ext. cabin - 
driveway - night
julia sits on 
the porch. paul is stretched out on the grass looking up at the stars.
paul
so the power 
went out. that doesn't mean anything.
julia
did you hear 
what she said?
paul
no.
julia
she was talking 
about the accident. the night you hit that thing on the road. she knew about 
that.
paul
julia, a 
psychic tells you some random shit and then lets you make sense out of it.
julia
she said it was 
waiting for us.
paul
oh sure. an 
animal was waiting for us to come along and run it down. what was the 
explanation? rotten home life? was it taking prozac?
julia
it wanted to 
stop the car.
paul
why?
julia
something about 
needing parts.
paul
if it needed 
parts, it shouldn't have committed suicide. 
julia
she said there 
were more of them.
paul
who cares what 
she said? it doesn't mean anything.
julia
but it's not 
just that.
julia's voice 
becomes soft. as if she were telling a secret.
julia (cont'd)
i've also had 
this feeling. ever since sam disappeared. i can't shake it.
paul
what is it?
julia
i feel like 
something's missing.
paul
something?
julia
i don't know. 
it's on the tip of my tongue. i just feel like ever since we woke up that 
morning, something's not right. like ... there's someone who should be here 
...
paul
right. sam.
julia
it's not 
sam.
(then)
did that palm 
reader say anything strange to you. anything at all?
paul hesitates. 
he looks back at the night sky.
paul
no.
beat.
julia
can i use your 
phone?
