int. corridor - 
continuous
julia stops at 
the corridor opening. the strobe light flashes within. clicking.
the corridor 
looks empty. nothing but pipes and shadows.
julia
we're almost 
there.
julia turns to 
paul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth. he stares back 
at her.
a moment of 
sheer horror. julia reels back into the corridor. pressed flat against the wall. 
sliding towards the crawl space opening.
paul starts 
advancing into the corridor. grinning with teeth that flash with every click of 
the strobe light.
she keeps 
sliding away ...
he grabs his 
chest and rips it open, tearing the covering skin apart as he would a shirt. a 
menagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it.
julia tries to 
scream. eyes wide. she can't make a sound.
paul tears the 
skin covering his chest wider. pulling it away. stripping himself clean.
julia reaches 
the crawl space. sliding down.
the last pieces 
paul's skin are torn off. the thing that had been pretending to be paul stands 
in his place.
only brief 
glimpses are allowed by the strobe light. an abysm of immemorial lunacy 
consisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal. a human heart beating 
within exposed ribs. bones combined with pulleys and rods. the face of a skull. 
a contradiction of all matter and cosmic order.
julia slips 
back into the crawl space. still trying to scream.
