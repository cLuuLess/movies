int. pacific 
heights residence - foyer - late afternoon
a nice house. 
large and affluent.
the doorbell 
chimes.
a few moments 
pass before a sullen figure arrives at the front door and pulls it open, 
revealing ...
paul
standing on the 
front porch. his wet hair plastered to his forehead, rain streaming off his 
cheeks, his handsome face turned pallid and colorless.
he manages a 
sheepish smile.
paul
dad.
standing at the 
door is a man in his mid-fifties, mr. loomis. a severe presence with a soured 
and weathered face. he stares at paul without any sign of emotion.
paul notices 
the slight. he presses onward. a bit haltingly. still hopeful and trying to 
connect.
paul (cont'd)
i was hoping we 
could talk ...
(beat)
i know we 
haven't done much of that recently, but still ...
(beat)
i was 
hoping.
beat.
paul (cont'd)
i'm in a lot of 
trouble. i'm getting sick ... and i was hoping ... 
(beat)
i was hoping 
you could help.
paul is having 
difficulty speaking. he's almost reduced to tears as he stands in the cold, 
stinging rain.
paul (cont'd)
i want to come 
home. please dad.
(desperate)
please let me 
come home.
a moment of 
silence.
paul (cont'd)
please?
his father 
stands steely eyed. his voice is icy and distant.
mr. loomis
i don't know 
you.
paul is 
devastated. he can barely utter a sound.
paul
i'm your 
son.
agonizing 
beat.
mr. loomis
i don't have a 
son.
(then)
i don't know 
you.
he slowly 
closes the door. paul begins weeping openly.
paul
dad ...
the door is 
shut in his face. nothing can be heard except for the rain falling outside.
