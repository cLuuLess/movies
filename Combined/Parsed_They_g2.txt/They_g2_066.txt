int. cabin - 
living room - day
terry looks 
beside herself. paul and julia are seated.
julia
he must have 
gotten out through the window. that's the only thing i can figure.
terry
we have to call 
the police.
julia
you looked 
everywhere?
paul
everywhere near 
the cabin. but we can't cover every square inch of forest out there.
terry
he might be 
sick. he might need help.
julia
i can't 
understand why he'd do something like this.
paul
he was acting 
nuts. really nuts.
terry
(impatient)
i need a 
phone.
paul
wait. i've got 
my cell.
paul fishes the 
cell phone out of his pocket. he hands it to her.
and the phone 
rings.
almost on cue. 
terry glances over at her friends, then clicks the receiver.
terry
hello?
(beat)
sam? 
...
julia and paul 
sit up in their seats.
terry (cont'd)
where are you? 
... no, where are you? ...
(beat)
how did you get 
there? ...
terry hurriedly 
grabs a pen. she starts writing on a pad.
terry (cont'd)
just a minute. 
i'm writing it down. market street. the ramada. i think i know where it is.
(beat)
sam, what's 
going on? what happened? ...
(then)
sam? ... sam? 
...
she hangs up 
the phone.
paul
where is 
he?
terry
san 
francisco.
julia
what?
terry
i don't know. 
he wants me to meet him. my brother has an apartment up there. he's out of town, 
but i have a spare key. i guess i could stay there.
beat.
julia
you still want 
to call the police?
silence. terry 
doesn't respond to this.
outside an open 
window, the wind hisses through the trees.
