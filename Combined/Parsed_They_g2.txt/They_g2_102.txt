ext. san francisco - market - late 
afternoon
julia is standing near the entrance. waiting 
patiently.
a figure across the street catches julia's 
attention -- a homeless man stumbling down the sidewalk, talking to himself, 
shaking a rattle.
voice 
(o.s.)
julia?
julia turns 
around, searching, not immediately recognizing the figure that briskly 
approaches her --
it's terry. but 
her once perfect appearance has become harsh and drawn. her blonde hair has been 
colored dark brown. there are sagging circles under her eyes. her skin is 
colorless. she moves quickly. nervously.
julia is 
shocked.
julia
terry?
terry's hands 
tremble.
terry
i'm glad you 
came. you don't have any idea how scared i've been.
julia
why did you 
change your hair?
terry is about 
to answer when a baby starts crying in the market. fear takes control of her 
face.
terry
we can't stay 
here.
julia
why?
terry
where are you 
parked?
julia
on the 
street.
terry
good. if we 
keep moving, they might have trouble tracking us.
terry takes 
julia's arm and leads her out of the market.
