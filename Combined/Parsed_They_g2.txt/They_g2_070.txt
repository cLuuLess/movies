ext. park - 
carousel - day
spinning 
merrily in the center of the park. bright lights. loud calliope music. young 
kids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches.
julia slowly 
walks towards the carousel, snapping pictures of the children and whirling 
lights. behind her, the sound of a screaming child rises above the music and 
laughter. she turns and finds a two year old baby sitting on her father's 
shoulders, crying and pointing at --
the young blond 
boy ...
wearing his 
blue superman shirt. he's sitting on a swing set by himself. sad and alone.
he makes eye 
contact with julia. waves timidly. she smiles at him and waves back.
close on: the 
carousel
gears turning. 
the poles spearing the horses rising and falling into the floor. the platform 
rotating near the grass.
the calliope 
music becomes the humming of machines.
