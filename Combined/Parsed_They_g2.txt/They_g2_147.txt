int. stairwell 
- continuous
steam rises 
from the pipes. bathing the stairwell in mist.
the fluorescent 
lights above are glimmering in the darkness. julia stands at the top of the 
stairwell. she can't even see the bottom of the steps.
carefully, she 
starts moving down. her hand gripping the metal railing.
the humming of 
machines grows louder ...
her foot 
accidentally kicks a few pieces of metal on the steps. a light clinking as the 
metal scatters down ahead of her.
the humming of 
machines is closer now. just beyond the sheathing clouds of blue and white 
mist.
the metal 
railing is suddenly replaced by human bones.
julia pulls her 
hand away from the railing. looks skyward and discovers more bones are being 
used to brace the ceiling along with metal beams.
she stops. 
shutting her eyes in fear. starts to lose control.
from somewhere 
within, she manages to steady herself. keeps going through the awaiting steam 
curtain at the bottom.
