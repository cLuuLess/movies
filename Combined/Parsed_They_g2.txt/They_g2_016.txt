int. range 
rover - night
the atmosphere 
is quickly turning into panic. paul jumps behind the wheel as both sam and terry 
close their doors.
sam
i want to know 
what that thing was.
paul presses 
the automatic door lock. thunk.
julia
paul, start the 
car.
paul
keys ...
he searches his 
pockets. they're empty. he checks his jacket.
sam
i want to know 
what it was.
paul
will you shut 
up?
paul fishes out 
the car keys from his jacket pocket. he starts the ignition. the engine roars to 
life.
julia
go.
a heavy thump. 
right outside the back window. sam and terry instinctively look towards the rear 
hatch.
terry
there's 
something behind the car.
julia
go!
paul hits the 
gas.
