ext. santa mira 
- town square - day
a picture 
postcard community consisting of quaint storefront shops and manicured 
parks.
paul stands 
right in front of a freshly painted realty office building with a picketed 
fence, sipping a coke, watching a homeless woman across the street screaming and shouting at traffic. she's right next 
to the parked range rover.
julia walks out 
of the realty office.
paul
finished?
julia
done. the cabin 
has a buyer.
paul
what about the 
movers?
julia
they're coming 
on sunday afternoon so we'll have to start packing.
the homeless 
woman starts walking off down the sidewalk. moving away from the rover's parking 
space.
paul
good. she's 
leaving. i thought we were gonna have to make a run for the car.
julia
i feel sorry 
for those people.
paul
me too. but 
that doesn't mean i want to get screamed at.
julia
people are 
ignoring her. maybe that's the only way she can get attention.
paul
she's doing a 
good job. kept me away.
they start 
crossing the street towards the car.
julia
how does 
someone end up like that?
paul
i think we're 
witnessing it first-hand with sam. what did you guys find on the road 
anyway?
julia
a dog.
paul stares at 
her. surprised.
paul
really?
julia
yeah. 
personally, i'm glad we didn't find frankenstein's monster.
paul
you just like 
being right.
julia
(grins)
damn 
straight.
