int. cabin - 
basement - day
a picture is 
lifted out of the developing basin. the shot of the little girl from the party. 
her expression is distant. tortured.
bathed in the 
red light, julia gazes at the picture for a moment, then places it to the side. 
she goes to work on the next piece of developing paper into the basin. she 
waits. rocks the basin a bit.
the timer in 
the basement ticks.
the picture 
starts to manifest. the photo of the children and pool shed at sam's house.
julia frowns 
slightly. something is wrong with the photograph as the details become more 
tangible. she lifts the photo out of the basin. mystified.
close on: the 
photo
standing just inside the shed's door is a 
blurred figure. featureless. barely distinguishable. hiding in the 
dark.
