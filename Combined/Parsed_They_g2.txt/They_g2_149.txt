int. lair - 
night
a massive room 
where empty human skins are dangling from hooks, complete and preserved from 
head to toe. the skins sway and rock gently in the draft. thousands of them.
julia moves 
towards the center of the room.
a large 
operating table awaits. but the surface of the table is sunken like a water 
basin. next to the table is a pedestal littered with bloody instruments. cutting 
tools. knives. curved hooks.
julia notices 
that paul's torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table. shirt shredded to 
a rag. sneakers orphaned nearby. jeans spattered with blood.
her breathing 
quickens. her heart pounding.
she reaches the 
foot of the table. paul is lying within the basin, completely naked and 
partially covered with littered body parts. organs and entrails. 
the basin is 
filled with water and blood. an immobile form is resting next to him.
julia moves 
quickly. she tries to wake him up.
julia
paul. paul, 
wake up.
he stirs. his 
nose crinkles slightly.
julia (cont'd)
wake up.
she grabs him 
and lifts him up. he starts coughing.
julia (cont'd)
you've gotta 
hurry.
(then)
here ...
julia grabs his 
jeans. she helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on.
a skinned hand 
grabs hers. julia yelps a scream.
the other form 
-- a thing in the basin -- rises 
and turns. slicked with blood. empty sockets where the eyes should be. mouth 
falling open. a horror that shouldn't be alive.
julia screams 
again.
her free hand 
grabs a hook from the pedestal and swings the blade into the thing's neck. blood 
fountains up.
the thing 
begins shrieking.
with paul 
leaning on her for support, julia rapidly heads for the door.
