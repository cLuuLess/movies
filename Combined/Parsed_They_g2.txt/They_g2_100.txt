julia turns to 
paul who sits silently in the passenger seat. he doesn't move.
julia

want to come with me?
paul
i'm too sick. i 
need to stay someplace.
julia
i'm worried 
about leaving you here.
paul
(shrugs)
it's not like 
he'll disown me.
julia
i know.
paul
and i really 
need him right now.
more thunder. 
julia kisses his cheek.
julia
i'm taking the 
cell phone. you call me.
paul

julia

doctor.
paul
i will.
paul opens the 
passenger door and steps out into the rain. julia watches him approach the 
house. then, she pulls away from the curb.
