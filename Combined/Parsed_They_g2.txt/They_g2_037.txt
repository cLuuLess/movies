int. cabin - 
bedroom - night
a spacious 
bedroom. typical. 
julia is 
already in bed and wearing a night shirt. paul is grinding out a set of 
crunches.
julia
it just would 
have been nice if somebody had looked at it. you were on the internet. terry was 
on the phone. i felt like i was living with a bunch of machines instead of 
people.
paul
someone's 
overreacting.
julia
would you look 
at it again?
paul
i already did. 
and i still don't see anything. 
paul gets into 
bed.
julia
that little 
girl said there was a monster in the shed.
paul
(kisses 
her)
it was probably 
another dog. good night.
he switches off 
the light. paul turns over and goes to sleep.
julia sits for 
a moment in the dark. alone with her thoughts. she looks over at the walk-in 
closet across the room.
the closet door 
is slightly open. just a crack. not enough to provide any clear view of what 
lies within, but just enough for something -- monsters included -- to peek 
out.
julia stares at 
the closet. spooked. she knows better, but it's dark and her primal fears are 
taking control.
julia
(to 
herself)
stupid.
she gets out of 
bed and tiptoes to the closet, shutting the door. then she gets back into bed. 
smiling to herself, she goes to sleep.
