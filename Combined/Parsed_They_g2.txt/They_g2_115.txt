ext. apartment 
building - fire escape - night
terry is 
immediately drenched by the storm. the door within her bedroom can be heard 
crashing open, followed by a roaring unlike anything on this earth.
terry rushes 
down the fire escape, feet banging on the metal steps. but she stops dead in her 
tracks when she notices --
several figures 
...
standing in the 
alley far below. looking up at her. waiting.
a sound rises 
up behind her. the sound of footsteps banging down the fire escape in 
pursuit.
terry
(horrified)
oh god ...
terry 
desperately goes to a window. she pulls it open, stepping inside, the banging 
footsteps right behind her.
