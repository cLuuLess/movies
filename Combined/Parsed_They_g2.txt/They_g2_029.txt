ext. forest - 
walking trail - day
paul is jogging 
through the woods. a light mist hangs in the cool air. the sounds of the forest 
surround him.
suddenly, the 
birds stop singing. paul becomes aware of this. he stops running and looks 
around. the forest is deathly still.
the sound of a 
twig being crushed underfoot. then nothing.
another moment. 
paul keeps going, a chill on his spine, looking back over his shoulder.
