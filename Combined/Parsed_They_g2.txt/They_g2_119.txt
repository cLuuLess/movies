ext. san 
francisco - street - night
the sound of a 
phone line ringing.
julia is 
sitting inside of the parked range rover, the cell phone pressed against her 
ear.

julia
(beat)

right number ...
click! the man 
hangs up the phone on the other line.
julia (cont'd)
hello?
julia stares at 
the cell phone in stunned confusion, until a sharp pain courses through her 
hand. she flinches and nearly drops the phone. julia checks her pricked 
finger.
the wound has 
grown. an infected red spot with a open hole in the center. the skin actually 
seems to be rotting around it, allowing the wound to expand like a sinkhole.
