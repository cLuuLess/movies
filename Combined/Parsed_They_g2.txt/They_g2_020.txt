int. fast food 
restaurant - bathroom - night
large and 
poorly lit. several closed bathroom stalls face a row of sinks and a huge 
mirror.
a toilet 
flushes. julia leaves one of the stalls and pulls the door closed behind her. 
she moves to the mirror, washes her hands, and retrieves a brush from her 
purse.
water drips 
from one of the leaky pipes in the bathroom while the fluorescent bulb over the 
mirror crackles softly. julia is about to brush her hair, but something unnerves 
her. she cocks her head slightly. a feeling.
she turns 
around and checks out the bathroom. the doors to the stalls are all closed shut. 
empty and quiet.
she starts 
brushing her hair. a few moments pass. then, she stops and listens to the water 
dripping from the pipe. julia turns back around and looks at the bathroom.
one of the 
stall doors all the way at the end is now slightly open. not much. just enough 
to reveal a patch of darkness and gloom within.
the sound of 
water dripping abruptly stops. silence follows.
julia looks 
like she's about to crawl out of her skin. she quickly shoves her brush back 
into her purse and leaves.
