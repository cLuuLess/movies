ext. bus depot 
- night
an empty bus 
station consisting of a single room with a clerk sitting behind the front desk. 
julia and paul are sitting on a pair of chairs, waiting patiently.
terry is using 
a phone booth outside. she hangs up and walks into the depot.
julia
did you get his 
parents?
terry
it was the 
wrong number.
julia
didn't sam give 
you that number?
terry
maybe i wrote 
it down wrong.
terry winces a 
bit. she massages her legs.
paul
are you 
okay?
terry
my legs are 
killing me.
julia
you sure you 
don't want us to drive you?
terry
nah. you have 
to stick around for the movers. i'll be fine.
the bus arrives 
in front of the depot.
terry (cont'd)
there's my 
ride.
terry grabs her 
suitcase. julia hands her a slip of paper.
julia
this is paul's 
cell number. you call us. let us know what happens.
terry
i just need to 
talk to him. don't call the police or anything until i've had a chance to do 
that.
julia
okay.
terry
thanks.
terry hugs 
julia. paul gives her a quick kiss on the cheek.
paul
remember. call 
us.
terry
i will.
carrying her 
suitcase, terry backs toward the door, smiling sadly at julia and paul as she 
opens it.
terry (cont'd)
it'll be okay. 
everything's okay.
her voice 
resonates with desperate hope rather than confidence. she leaves the depot.
paul places his 
arms around julia as they watch the bus leave the station, trailing smoke.
