ext. palm 
reader's booth - night
tess takes 
paul's hand.
tess
so what do you 
want to know?
paul
it's kinda 
stupid. but i sorta wanted to know about my dad. if i should see him.
tess
(knowingly)
you and your 
father don't get along.
paul
no.
tess
something 
happened?
paul
my parents got 
divorced when i was sixteen. i got into a fight with him. said some stuff.
he bows his 
head a little. a tough subject for him.
tess
let's take a 
look ...
tess cocks her 
head a little to the side. she looks confused.
tess (cont'd)
(soft)
i'll be 
damned.
paul
what's 
wrong?
tess
well kid, you 
might be the first person to make me hang up my fortune telling degree. usually 
the palm makes sense, and this one doesn't.
paul
how do you 
mean?
tess
according to 
this, you don't exist.
off paul, his 
face turning white.
