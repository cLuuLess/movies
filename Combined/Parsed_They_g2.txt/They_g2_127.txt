int. coffee 
shop - night
julia walks out 
of the restroom. stops cold.
everyone in the 
coffee shop is staring at her. the customers. the waiters.
the lights are 
dimming. a lack of power.
julia forces 
herself to move. she goes to her table, picks up the photographs, and suddenly 
notices that in the graduation pictures --
sam and terry 
have disappeared. almost as if they never were a part of the photos. paul and 
julia are together in every picture -- alone.
julia grabs the 
photographs and turns around.
the customers 
in the coffee shop are standing now. their eyes are dark shadows. something 
about the way they stand is completely unnatural. all wrong.
panic begins to 
settle in. julia quickly walks to the door.
waiter
julia?
she turns. the 
waiter stands behind her. eyes burning.
waiter (cont'd)
(menacing)
why'd you take 
it out?
that's enough. 
julia gets the hell out of there.
