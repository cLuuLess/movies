ext. woods - 
trail - day
a lonely part 
of the woods where almost all the daylight is blocked out by the trees.
paul jogs along 
the trail when he slows to a halt, sweaty and out of breath. his skin is pale. 
his limbs are shivering. paul cradles his head, shutting his eyes, suffering 
from obvious pain.
paul
(very 
soft)
oh god .... 
make it stop ...
he starts 
walking forward again. very slowly.
a slight 
tinkling sound as he kicks something at his feet. his eyes blink open as he 
looks down ...
there are several pieces of metal littering 
the trail. almost like nuts and bolts, but alien in their design.
paul reaches 
down and picks one of the bolts up. studies it. he keeps walking, following more 
pieces of metal that lead off the footpath.
