ext. forest 
road - day
the same lonely 
stretch of road from the night before.
the range rover 
appears around a corner and pulls over to the side of the road. julia opens her 
door, camera in hand, and gets out. sam follows her lead.
sam
this is it?
julia
i think so. you 
can see the way the road turns sharply to the left. the rest of the drive was 
straight.
sam
you've got 
film, right?
julia
a new roll. you 
can have all the pictures you want.
julia and sam 
start searching the ditch. feet crunching in the dirt. moving away from the 
car.
a soft thump 
echoes from somewhere in the woods. a place just beyond the wall of pine 
branches and shrubbery that shivers in the breeze.
sam and julia 
look around. they wait. nothing. nobody.
sam
(slight 
grin)
the boogeyman 
lives here.
julia
so will you if 
you keep talking like that.
they keep 
walking. a beat passes.
sam
julia? can i 
ask you something?
julia
go ahead.
sam
last night on 
the road, after i took the picture and we started walking to paul's car, did you 
have the same feeling?
julia
what 
feeling?
sam
that we were 
being chased.
julia doesn't 
say anything.
she stops cold 
in her tracks. just ahead of her, resting motionless in the ditch, is ...
a body ...
swathed in dark 
fur, twisted at a pathetic angle, huge gashes in its side. the corpse of a doberman pinscher. flies are buzzing 
and swarming over the dog's open wounds.
julia and sam 
move towards the dog's lifeless form.
julia
there's your 
monster.
sam
that's a 
dog.
julia
right.
sam kneels in 
front of the corpse. waves off some flies.
sam
that's not what 
i saw.
julia
i don't see any 
other corpses on the side of the road, do you?
a long moment. 
sam stares back down at the doberman's body.
sam
that's not what 
i saw.
close on the 
dog
eyes slightly 
open. a misshapen form plagued with flies.
the sound of 
insects swarming drowns out the wind hissing through the trees.
