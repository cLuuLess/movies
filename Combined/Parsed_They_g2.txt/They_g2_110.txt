int. apartment 
building - upstairs hallway - night
quiet and dimly 
lit. several of the lights are burnt out, leaving the hallway drowning in 
shadows.
the elevator 
doors open. terry exits and moves quickly down the hallway. her face is 
terrified. sick.
she arrives at 
an apartment. terry fumbles with her keys.
a soft thumping in the hallway. deep and 
hollow. terry spins around, the keys jingling in her hand.
nothing there. 
the hall appears to be empty and dark. one of the lights overhead is flickering 
and buzzing softly, providing 
scant illumination.
she takes a 
step back ...
a soft tinkling 
sound at her feet. terry looks down to find a few pieces of metal littering the 
floor. nuts and bolts. rods. alien in design.
terry's 
paranoia rises to a fever pitch. she turns the key in the lock. opens the front 
door.
