int. subway 
train - day
julia begins 
beating on the doors to be heard. connor and his friends are a little freaked 
but they're still laughing at her.
julia
please! connor! 
i'm your sister!
the train 
starts to move. people inside move in front of the doors and block julia's view 
of her brother.
julia (cont'd)
please don't 
leave me! connor!
julia runs 
alongside the train. still beating on the doors. her face awash with tears.
julia (cont'd)
they're going 
to kill me!!!
(shrieks)
they 
...!!!!
the train picks 
up speed. julia is left behind.
the grinding of 
the wheels is heard as the train moves into the subway tunnel. the sound of machines drowns out every 
other sound and consumes all.
blackout.
