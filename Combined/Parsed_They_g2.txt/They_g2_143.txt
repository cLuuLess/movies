int. subway 
station - platform - night
she reaches the 
platform and rushes to the center.
there's nobody 
else down there. the lights are flickering. slowly, they return to normal.
julia
(calling)
paul?!
no 
response.
a train rumbles 
through the station. julia moves to the opposite side and looks.
resting on the 
tracks, leading into the tunnel, are a trail of metal pieces. exactly like the 
ones from the cabin.
julia looks 
back. the guard is coming down the escalator.
without 
hesitation, she jumps down to the tracks. moving quickly and bending down to 
avoid being seen, she rushes into the awaiting subway tunnel.
