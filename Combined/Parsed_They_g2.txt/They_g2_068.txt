int. cabin - 
living room - day
julia is 
cleaning up. she kneels down and picks up some of the melted candles and beer 
bottles.
paul walks into 
room holding a broken picture frame.
paul
i talked to the 
movers.
julia
why didn't they 
show up?
paul
the company has 
no record of the order.
beat.
julia
what?
paul
i know. it's 
crazy.
julia
are they coming 
now?
paul
it'll take them 
a while to work us into the schedule -- get a van out here to pick up 
everything.
julia
how long?
paul
three days.
julia
(exhausted)
shit.
paul holds out 
the mangled frame.
paul
i also found 
this in the guest bedroom. sam knocked one of the packing boxes over. this was 
inside.
julia takes a 
look at the frame. it's the same picture from her room of herself with her 
mother. the broken glass has torn the photograph.
paul (cont'd)
i wasn't sure 
if you wanted to keep it.
julia
no. i've got 
one.
beat.
julia (cont'd)
you know this 
is the only picture i have of my mother?
(beat)
she was always 
taking pictures of us, but we never got any of her.
(emotional)
if i didn't 
have this, i couldn't prove that i had a mother.
paul
that's not 
true.
another 
beat.
julia
i'm so worried 
about sam.
julia drowns in 
her thoughts. paul touches her cheek.
paul
let's get outta 
here.
julia
(smiles)
good idea.
paul
i'll get my 
keys.
paul walks out. 
julia places the frame on the coffee table.
she notices 
something on the floor. julia squints. it's a small object resting in the corner 
... almost hidden from view. julia reaches into the shadows and picks up ...
another piece of metal with strange markings. 
exactly like the one from the closet.
julia stares at 
the object in her palm. surprised.
julia
(to 
herself)
where are these 
coming from?
