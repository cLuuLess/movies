int. corridor - 
continuous
julia pulls 
herself through another opening and finds herself standing in the threshold of a 
corridor. both the walls and floor are constructed of crude metal grates and 
long pipes. anything could be hiding within. waiting.
she moves 
slowly into the corridor, a strobe light flickering around her. she gropes 
towards another opening.
the sound of 
her terrified breathing is slowly replaced by the rhythmic humming of 
machines.
