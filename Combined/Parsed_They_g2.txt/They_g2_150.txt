int. main 
hallways - continuous
julia navigates 
her way through the hallways. moving blindly through sudden jets of steam, the 
sound of machines around them. paul leans on her, his eyes remaining closed, 
coughing and stumbling.
julia's pov
racing through 
the halls. the steam clouds suddenly exploding into her view.
