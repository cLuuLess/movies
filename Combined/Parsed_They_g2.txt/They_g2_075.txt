ext. psychic 
booth - night
rosemary 
handles one of the metal objects, turning it over in her palm. julia watches her 
as she goes through this ritual.
rosemary
this is 
interesting.
julia
let me guess. 
they came from a vacuum cleaner, right?
beat.
rosemary
machines.
julia
excuse me?
rosemary
this came from 
a machine. but not a household appliance.
julia
where did it 
come from?
rosemary turns 
the object over in her palm. over and over.
rosemary
something that 
was alive.
julia leans 
forward in her seat.
julia
but you just 
said it came from a machine.
rosemary
i know.
julia
so how can a 
machine be alive?
rosemary
i don't make 
the news. i just report it.
julia
i found the 
larger one inside of a closet. do you know how it got there?
rosemary 
continues meditating. turning the object over between her fingers. staring at 
it.
gradually, she 
falls into a trance. her breathing slows.
rosemary
we shed our 
parts.
julia
what?
rosemary
and our 
skin.
julia
i'm sorry. what 
are you talking about?
rosemary is 
oblivious to anything around her.
rosemary
but they need 
to be replaced. some of the parts we can find.
(beat)
others need to 
be harvested.
the other 
psychic seated next to rosemary throws her a curious glance as she counts up 
some money.
rosemary (cont'd)
we'll wait on 
the side of the road. until one of the machines come.
(beat)
one of us will 
be sacrificed. that will stop the machine. then we can take whatever skins are 
inside.
(softer)
we can use 
their parts.
paul walks 
up.
paul
julia?
she motions for 
him to be quiet.
rosemary
we stopped the 
machine. but there are more of the skins than we thought ...
paul
julia. let's 
take off.
julia
hold on.
rosemary
we must wait. 
more of us are needed to capture them.
paul
what's she 
talking about?
julia
wait just a 
minute. please.
beat.
the objects 
continue turning in her hand ... and turning ... and turning ... and turning 
...
rosemary
there are more 
of us now. we've surrounded them. but they're leaving too quickly.
paul
julia?
&nbsp;... and turning ...
rosemary
we'll follow 
them. we'll watch them.
(beat)
we'll take them 
as the need for parts becomes necessary ...
paul
(louder)
julia?
the wind gently 
hisses through the booth's tent.
rosemary
maybe we'll 
only take one ...
(beat)
maybe we'll 
take another ... and another ... and another ... and another ...
a sudden gust 
of wind rises through the tent as ...
the power fails 
throughout the park. lights start going out in sections until the entire fair is 
pitch black.
the sound of 
mumbling and confusion seethes from the crowd. julia rises out of her chair. 
paul takes her into her arms as children can be heard crying throughout the 
park.
above them, the 
wind hisses through the trees.
