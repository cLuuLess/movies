flashback: int. 
cabin - living room - night
candles have 
been placed around the room. paul and terry are asleep on the floor.
blood drips 
over the superman tattoo on joey's shoulder.
julia slowly 
awakens to the sounds of joey screaming over sickening ripping sounds like cloth 
being torn in half.
there are silhouettes on the wall of three 
figures tearing off pieces of something in the room. large flaps. chunks. moving 
rapidly and ferociously.
julia spots sam 
screaming across the room.
sam
(shrieking)
joey!
julia turns her 
head in the direction of the ripping and tearing sounds. her eyes slowly widen 
as her mouth drops into a soundless, petrified look of horror.
a hand with 
midnight skin, six fingers, and punctured with steel rods covers her eyes.
