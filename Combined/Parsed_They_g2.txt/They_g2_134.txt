ext. san 
francisco - street - night
julia turns a 
corner and runs straight into an intersection.
a horn blares 
as a bus barrels towards her.
julia barely 
leaps out of the way as the bus screeches to a halt, nearly running her down. 
she rises to her feet as the bus starts moving again.
several of the 
passengers have their faces pressed against the windows. watching her. dark 
circles around their eyes.
julia keeps 
going. the pursuing customers from the coffee shop are marooned on the opposite 
corner by traffic. they stand motionless. watching her escape.
