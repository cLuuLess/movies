int. fast food 
restaurant - night
everyone is 
sitting quietly at a table. fast food leavings are littered across their plastic 
trays. nobody is saying anything or looking at one another.
finally ...
sam
i want to get 
the body.
everyone's face 
drops into shock. paul almost laughs.
paul
you do that. 
we'll wait for your ass right here.
sam leans 
forward in his seat. intense.
sam
nothing about 
that thing looked right. absolutely nothing. there was metal in its 
skeleton.
terry
maybe it wasn't 
metal. it might've just looked like metal.
sam
there were 
fucking gears, for chrissake.
paul
fine. go back 
out there. do whatever the hell you want. but count me out. i'm done.
julia
we've already 
got a picture, sam.
sam
let's get a few 
more then. i want to get a good look at that thing up close.
terry
(adamant)
i'm not going 
back there.
sam
let julia 
decide. it's her camera.
the group 
stares at julia. she remains silent.
paul
your call.
julia stares 
back at all of them. a moment.
a small child 
begins crying and screaming in the restaurant. julia flinches at the unexpected 
sound, glancing over at the child's parents as they quiet him down.
she rises from 
the table. 
julia
i have to use 
the bathroom.
she walks 
straight into the bathroom.
after she's 
gone ...
terry
i'm not going 
back there.
