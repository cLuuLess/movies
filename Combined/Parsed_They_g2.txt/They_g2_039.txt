int. cabin - 
bedroom - night
the clock on 
the night table reads 3:15 am. julia turns over in her sleep and stirs awake. 
she groggily looks over towards the closet. julia practically sits up in 
bed.
the closet door is wide open.
a childhood 
nightmare come to life. julia's breathing quickens. she reaches towards the 
other side of the bed.
julia
(a 
whisper)
paul?
her hand finds 
nothing but sheets and empty space. there's nobody there. she quickly turns to 
locate her boyfriend. but he's gone.
she tries to 
switch on the light. click.
the light stays 
off. she tries again. click.
nothing 
happens.
then, she hears 
it. a faint sound. almost like a shuffling. the sound of something 
dragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed.
julia's throat 
has gone dry. carefully, she creeps towards paul's side of the bed and checks 
the floor.
there is 
nothing in sight. the only sign of movement are the shadows from the trees 
outside.
there is only 
one place left to look. julia cautiously steps down to the floor. sinking down 
on her knees, she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the inky 
darkness underneath the bed. the space is empty.
julia drops the 
dust ruffle and sits up, gasping.
a black shape 
is standing behind her.
then, a 
familiar voice comes from it.
paul
hey ... it's 
just me.
paul switches 
on the light. he's wearing a ucla sweatshirt.
julia
the light 
wouldn't turn on.
paul
works now.
julia catches 
her breath. the fear finally draining from her.
julia
where were 
you?
paul
i was cold so i 
got a sweater from the closet. and i went to the bathroom. why were you looking 
under the bed?
julia isn't 
quite sure how to answer. she's embarrassed.
julia
i thought there 
was something in the room.
paul
(skeptical)
something? like 
what?
