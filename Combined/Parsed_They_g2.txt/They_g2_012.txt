int. range 
rover - dusk
paul sits 
behind the wheel. he's bopping and rapping with sam to hip-hop that blares from 
the speakers. very energized.
julia sits on 
the passenger side, leaning against the window, trying to shut out the music. 
terry looks just as miserable. finally, julia turns off the radio.
a silent beat. 
the guys catch their girlfriends' expressions.
paul
sorry.
sam
(overlapping)
sorry.
terry leans 
forward between the seats.
terry
so the cabin 
has electricity, right? and plumbing? everything we need?
julia
uh-huh.
terry
so it has 
everything.
julia
it has 
everything.
sam
wait a minute. 
i hear a shoe about to drop.
julia
except a 
phone.
sam
bam! there it 
is.
terry
(scandalized)
i need a phone. 
it's like family to me. mom, dad, my brother .... phone.
julia
so you're 
roughing it.
terry
the last time i 
tried to rough it, i was in therapy for a year. why didn't your mother have a 
phone?
julia
i guess she 
wanted to be left alone.
at least until 
she got sick.
paul looks to 
her.
paul
this won't be 
too hard on you, will it?
staying at her 
place?
julia
it's okay. i'm 
enjoying this.
julia smiles at 
him. paul smiles back.
paul
good.
he switches the 
radio back on and continues rapping with sam. julia and terry both stare 
straight ahead, ears pounding. this is turning into a long trip.
