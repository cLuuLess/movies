int. apartment 
building - hallway - night
the apartment 
floor is being renovated. plastic tarps cover the doors and windows. terry races 
through the hallway, screaming wildly as she pounds on the doors.
terry
help me! please 
help!!!
terry rockets 
around the corner. she presses the elevator door button frantically.
the sound of 
croaking and hissing fills the hallway.
the elevator 
doors slide open.
terry lunges 
into the elevator, hits for the lobby, then starts beating frenziedly on the 
door close button.
several shadows 
appear in the hallway. getting closer.
terry screams 
wildly and keeps pounding the button.
the bizarre 
hissing becomes a frightful roar just as ...
the elevator 
doors pull shut. closing on the unseen things in the hallway.
