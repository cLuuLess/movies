int. subway 
station - late afternoon
people are 
crowded on the platform, waiting as a bart train rushes into the station.
the doors open. 
passengers move off the train. others get on.
julia rushes 
down the stairs and pushes past the arriving commuters. there's no sign of 
terry. julia keeps searching. looks right. then left. finally, she spots terry 
boarding the bart train.
julia
terry! 
wait!
julia rushes 
forward, squirming through the crowd, until she reaches the doors just as they 
slam closed. she looks through the windows, trying to find terry amongst the 
crowd inside.
the train 
starts to move.
standing at one 
of the train's passenger windows, his face and palms pressed against the glass, 
is --
the blond boy 
in the superman shirt.
staring 
directly at her. dark circles around his eyes.
he smiles at 
julia.
his teeth are made of metal.
julia stands 
thunderstruck. the boy in the window moves past.
the train 
shoots into the awaiting tunnel. julia is left standing frozen and immobile on 
the platform.
near the subway 
entrance, a homeless man with hooks for hands is convulsing as he sits against 
the wall. eyes wide open. shaking horribly and staring at nothing.
