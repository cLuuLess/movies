ext. psychic 
booth - night
julia walks to 
the front counter of the booth.
a pair of women 
are sitting behind the counter, but the one who sticks out is rosemary, sixty, 
psychic and clairvoyant. she wears a purple kaftan which barely hides her 
weakness for ice cream and cookies.
rosemary
can we help 
you, honey?
julia
you can tell me 
things just by holding something of mine. right?
rosemary
absolutely. i 
have a perfect track record. i found two missing children in the spring of '74, 
and helped the state police catch a murderer in '81.
julia
wow. that's 
amazing.
rosemary
(sourly)
my 
grandchildren aren't quite as impressed.
(a 
little brighter)
what did you 
want me to look at?
julia reaches 
into her pocket and gently places something on the counter in front of 
rosemary.
the metal 
objects from the closet and the living room.
