int. cabin - 
living room - night
a warm and 
comfortable cabin. simple and subdued.
paul is seated 
on the couch, typing into his powerbook which is hooked up into a phone jack in 
the wall. julia stands next to him, holding the photograph.
julia
i've never seen 
anything like this before. i thought it might be a flaw in the negative, but now 
i'm not so sure. will you take a look?
paul
(not 
paying attention)
okay.
he keeps 
watching.
julia
today.
paul
i'm busy.
julia
you're in a 
chat room with a bunch of strangers.
paul
(defensive)
they're 
friends.
julia
oh yeah? what 
are their last names?
they sit face 
to face. paul is speechless for a moment, then impatiently takes the photograph 
and looks at it.
paul
i don't see 
anything.
he puts the 
photo down and gets back to the chat room.
julia
you didn't even 
look.
paul
(he 
didn't)
i looked.
julia
there's 
somebody in the shed. i couldn't see it when i took the picture, but now it's 
there.
paul
i know. usually 
when you take a picture, you can't see a blur.
paul smiles at 
her. completely smug. julia stares right back.
julia
give your 
"friends" my best.
julia takes the 
photograph and leaves. paul types into his computer: "julia sends her best." the 
message pops up next to his user name. within seconds, several other user names 
in the chat room respond with "who's julia???"
