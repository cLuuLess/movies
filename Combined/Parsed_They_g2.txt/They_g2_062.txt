int. cabin - 
hallway - day
the group walks 
towards one of the bedroom doors.
terry
it's sam. i 
can't get the door open.
paul tries the 
doorknob. the door won't budge. paul knocks.
paul
sam, open 
up.
no answer. he 
pounds harder.
paul (cont'd)
sam?
terry
he won't 
answer.
julia
maybe he can't 
answer.
paul shoves 
hard against the door. but it still won't give.
paul
what about the 
bathroom door? it connects to your room.
terry
i tried it. 
it's locked.
paul turns the 
doorknob and throws all his weight against the door, trying his best to bust it 
down. no such luck.
paul
(voice 
rising)
sam?
he tries again 
and again. whoomph! .... whoomph! ....
whoomph! the 
door inches open. just a crack.
paul 
(cont'd)
help me out 
with this.
paul and julia 
push on the door, forcing it wider.
