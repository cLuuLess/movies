ext. sherwood forest - day
fire.   blazing rampant.
along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire
arrows. at a shouted order, another wave of flaming
arrows ignites the trees.
behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback.
one is the sheriff, in full armor. the other is the
black-clad celtic chieftain. he sits as still as a rock.
