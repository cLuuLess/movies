int. castle chapel - day
sword raised, nottingham has robin backed against the
altar.
                          nottingham
            what can your puny god do for
            you now?
the blade comes whirring down... clang! it's blocked.
robin has the altar's crucifix in his hand.
he swings it again, slamming nottingham across the
temple.  the sheriff hits the floor. robin grabs his
father's sword. raises it two-fisted. nottingham tries
to squirm away.
                          robin
            this is for my father.

he drives the sword down, like a stake, right through
nottingham's heart. the man shudders, and is still.
robin stands over him. drained. tuck rushes outside.
kneels at aslan's side. robin spots marian swaying on
the edge of the steep parapet.
