ext. city square - day
robin emerges from the castle. draped over his shoulder,
marian is kicking and beating at him. he reaches the
fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into
the freezing water.
she leaps to her feet, yelling. slips and tumbles back.
water streams from her bridal gown. a crowd gathers,
enjoying the show.
                        marian
         robin?   oh god, is that you?
she stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him,
pounding her fists on his chest.
                       marian
         how dare you?!
robin grins at the crowd.
                       robin
         i think she's feeling better.
marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of
battle. reality gradually sinks in. she folds against
robin's chest.
little john arrives, his huge arms enfolding wulf and
fanny.
                       little john
         we done it, mate. we clobbered
         the buggers.
                         fanny
         are you 'urt?
                         robin
         it will mend.
he spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of
aslan. his smile fades. he runs over. cradles aslan's
head.
                       robin
         aslan, my friend.
                                           (continued)

                                                     130.
continued:
                       aslan
         i'm going home the easy way,
         robin.
                       friar
                (shaking aslan)
         you die on me, you son of satan,
         and i swear i'll bury you as a
         christian in st. catherine's
         cathedral with a thousand monks
         chanting prayers for your
         miserable soul. you hear me?
                       aslan
                (weakly)
         i have no strength, brother tuck.
                       friar
                (kicking him)
         a fine friend you are! by the
         grace of allah and jehovah we
         have won the day, and you want to
         give up the ghost. i'll pickle
         your remains in mead, lay you
         in your grave with a pig for a
         companion, and mark it with a
         cross as big as this castle.
                        aslan
         please!   it hurts when i laugh.
                      friar
         see. there's life in the heathen
         dog yet.
                       robin
                (laughs)
         here, tuck. look after him.    you
         deserve each other.
robin stands, marian joins him. around them cheering
grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.
                        crowd
         robin hood!   robin hood!
                                            dissolve to:
