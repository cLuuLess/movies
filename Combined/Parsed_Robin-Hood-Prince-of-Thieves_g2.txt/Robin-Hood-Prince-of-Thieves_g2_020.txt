int. dubois mansion - day
the hall. deer heads.        boar heads.   portraits of
ancestors.
                            old woman
            wait here.
he waits.    creaking footsteps on the balcony.

                            girl
            who are you?
dim lighting.    robin cannot make out who it is.
                          robin
            i am robin of locksley.
                             girl
            you lie.     robin is dead.
                          robin
            i may meet my maker soon from lack
            of sustenance. but for now i am
            real enough.
                                                (continued)

                                                        33.
continued:
                       girl
         step into the light.    turn around.
                       robin
         by heaven, am i to dance next?
         who are you?
                       girl
         i am the maid marian.
                       robin
         then show yourself, child.     for we
         knew each other well.
                       girl
         with the king away, these are
         lawless times. there are outlaws
         villainous enough to kidnap and
         ransom a relative of his.
                       robin
         you know i am not one of them.
         besides, i am sworn to protect
         you.
                       girl
                (laughs)
         protect me? robin of locksley was
         nothing but a spoiled bully.
                       robin
         allow that years of war and prison
         may change a man. step forward,
         marian, so i may see how you have
         changed.

she moves into the light... fat.     rotten teeth.   ugly as
sin.
                       robin
         er... the years have been kind.
                       girl
         thank you. now remove yourself
         from this household.
a figure steps behind robin.    sticks a sword in his back.
                       girl
                (turning away)
         as you can see, we are already
         well protected.
                         robin
         wait, marian!    ...ouch!
                                             (continued)

                                                         34.
continued:
the sword is jabbed into his back. robins faces the man
-- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.
                        robin
          you are truly courageous against
          an unarmed man.
the figure gestures towards the door. robin sidesteps.
slams an elbow. the sword drops. slides across the
floor. robin moves for it, but the man intercepts,
drawing a dagger.
robin darts to the wall. rips off an antlered deer head.
defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.


outside
the sound of the fight indoors.   aslan hurls himself at
the door. it doesn't give.

inside
chunks of horn fly. robin parries and thrusts.     the
horns get shorter. robin retreats.
left with just the nubs, robin hurls the deer head at
the mask. gaining advantage, he charges. grabs the
dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. the knife drops.
robin wrenches off the mask.
long hair tumbles down... a beautiful young woman.
the front door caves in. aslan stumbles through... just
in time to see the woman's knee fly up into robin's
crotch. robin folds. the battle is over. the young
woman stands over robin.
                        young woman
          as she was saying, we have
          no need of your protection.
robin croaks through clenched teeth.
                       robin
          marian.
                                             cut to:
