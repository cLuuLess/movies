int. dungeons - day
tuck picks himself up from the floor.    the jailer is
amazed.
                       friar
         the lord helps those who help
         themselves.
grinning, he pulls open his robes, revealing chest armor
... and a miniature powder keg. he holds it to his
flaming torch and tosses it to the jailer... stupified,
the man catches the smoking bomb.

                       friar
         give my regards to the devil.
the keg erupts, blowing the jailer through a wall.
