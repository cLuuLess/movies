         we have to be ready to move camp
         at any time. the only way we can
         be attacked is from the nottingham
         road. we hide lookouts in the
         trees, here and here. if they
         see soldiers, they shoot warning
         arrows. whistles by day, fire
         by night.

         father!   come quick.   mother's
         dying.
