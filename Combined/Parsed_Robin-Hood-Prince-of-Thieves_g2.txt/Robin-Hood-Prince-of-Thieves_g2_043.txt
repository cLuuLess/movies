ext. woodsmen's camp - day
an arrow flies into a bull's-eye, crudely marked on a
tree. little john lowers his crossbow, delighted at
his shot.
                       little john
                (to wulf)
         right m'lad. let's see how close
         you can git to that bugger.
wulf takes aim. his arrow slices clear through his
father's arrow, splitting it in two. little john slaps
wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.
                       little john
         take a gander at this 'un, mates.
         never seen nuthin' like it in
         my bloomin' life.

robin leads marian through the camp... the beginnings of
a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac-
ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses,
camouflaging a giant pit. marian is impressed, but not
about to admit it.
                       marian
         this better be damned important.
robin leads her into a hut. inside is a trove of cap-
tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats
and... the treasure chest. at robin's nod, bull throws
back the lid. marian is speechless.
                       robin
         nottingham robs the poor. we
         rob nottingham and give back to
         the poor.
                                            (continued)

                                                       77.
continued:
                        marian
          do you think he's going to let
          you get away with all this? the
          man is without mercy. he will
          annihilate you.
                        robin
          somebody has to take a stand.
                        marian
          you're taking a stand with the
          lives of these people. these
          young ones.
a beat. she checks the faces. her eyes meet robin's.
is there a hint of concern for him also?
                        marian
          what do you want from me?
                        robin
          nottingham was sending this gold
          to buy reinforcements from the
          celtic tribesmen. we need to
          warn king richard.
                        marian
          nottingham would not dare
          challenge the king.
                        robin
          the king is not in england to
          be challenged, is he? while he
          is away, he may lose his country.
                 (marian masks her
                  concern)
          you are richard's cousin. you
          can get word to him. he would
          believe you.
                        marian
          now you want me to participate
          in your folly?
a little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild
flowers. touched, marian kneels to accept the offering.
                                             cut to:

bouquet
protrudes from marian's saddle. she is mounted, ready
to go. sarah giggles as she takes her leave of bull.
                                             (continued)

                                                       78.
continued:
                       robin
                (to marian)
         i am sending duncan with you.
         give him some warm food and a
         real bed. i grow tired of his
         bellyaching.
                       duncan
         hah! i have endured more hardship
         in my lifetime than any man here.
robin laughs and speaks to marian in a stage whisper.
                       robin
         don't tell him i told you, but
         he may be useful to you. there
         is no one to whom i would rather
         entrust your safety.
                       marian
         duncan, you are most welcome.
taking the lead rein from duncan's horse, she rides away.
                       robin
                (calls after her)
         will you send word to the king?
                       marian
         i'll think about it.
