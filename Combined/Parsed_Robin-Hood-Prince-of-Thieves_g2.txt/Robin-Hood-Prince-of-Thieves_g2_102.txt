int. castle - chapel - day
nottingham slashes maniacally.   robin is cornered,
weakening.
                       nottingham
         you should have stayed away,
         locksley. fools like you never
         learn.
a blow slices robin's arm. his sword flies from his
grasp. nottingham gloats. two of his men scramble back
to their feet. robin is beat... a war cry! aslan,
followed by tuck.

                         aslan
         ali akbar!
                         friar
         amen!
                       mortianna
                (seeing aslan)
         agh... the painted one!
nottingham glances over... a split-second opportunity!...
robin lashes out. kicks the sheriff in the gut, chops
down his sword hand. his father's sword clatters to the
floor.
whirling swords in each hand, aslan attacks the other
men. robin pile-drives nottingham into the wall.
                                            (continued)

                                                        127.
continued:
the bishop makes his escape.    tuck blocks his path.
                      friar
         so! you sold your soul to the
         devil?
                       bishop
         no, i swear it, in god's name.
                       friar
         blasphemer! you accuse innocent
         men of druid worship while you
         practice the black arts yourself.
the bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes.

a taloned hand grips a spear... mortianna creeps up on
aslan.
                       robin
                (glimpsing her)
         watch out!
aslan spins... too late. screeching, mortianna drives
the spear into aslan's side. he cries out and slides to
the floor.
nottingham uses robin's distraction to regain his sword.
back on the defensive, robin tries to evade the blows.
mortianna drags marian out onto a balcony. robin cannot
pursue. in acute pain, aslan struggles to his feet.
grasping the spear where it enters his side, he pulls with
all his strength.
the bishop, concealed dagger in hand, approaches tuck.

                       bishop
                (innocently)
         i am sure you would not strike a
         man of the cloth.
                        friar
         think again!
without an eyeblink's pause, tuck punches the bishop so
hard, he flies back through a stained-glass window.
