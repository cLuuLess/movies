ext. locksley castle - dawn
red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees.
robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave.
heads bowed, duncan and aslan stand at his side.
                       robin
         our last words in this world were
         spoken in anger. he called the
         crusades a foolish quest, said it
         was vanity to force other men to
         our religion. he was right.
                (looks to aslan,
                 then back to the
                 grave)
         please forgive me, father.
                       duncan
         he loved you till the end, young
         master. he never gave up hope of
         your return.
                       robin
         i failed him. i should have been
         here at his side.
                       duncan
         you must leave, head north to
         safety. gisborne will surely seek
         revenge.
                       robin
         leave me.
                                          (continued)

                                                     29.
continued:
                       duncan
         i know what you're thinking. but
         one man can achieve nothing
         against so many. you would need
         an army.
                         robin
         leave me.
                         aslan
         come, friend.
he leads the old man away.
                                           cut to:


grave side - later
pouring rain. robin stands drenched at the grave side.
aslan watches from the shelter of trees. duncan heats a
stale chunk of bread over the ashes of a small fire.
                       duncan
         he still stands vigil?
                         aslan
         like a rock.
duncan offers half the bread to the saracen.
                       duncan
         a curse on the saracens! were it
         not for their ungodly ways, he
         would never have left. this would
         never have happened.

                       aslan
         it surprises me that one who
         curses others so readily has lived
         so long.
                       duncan
         i do not recognize the style of
         your voice, friend. are you
         irish? a cornishman?
                         aslan
         er... no.
                       duncan
         what manner of name is aslan then?
                       aslan
         a fine saracen name.
                                           (continued)

                                                      30.
continued:
                         duncan
         lord, no!
he chokes in shock.   spitting bread.
                       aslan
         lord, yes. but eat in peace. i
         take no offense.
                (glances at robin)
         by the prophet! what is the man
         doing?
robin raises his dagger over his wrist.   aslan runs to
him.

                         aslan
         wait!
too late. robin slashes the dagger across his palm.
rain and blood mingle. streaming onto the grave.
                       robin
         i swear by my own blood. i will
         not rest until i have restored my
         father's name.
                (a whisper)
         ... or until i am dead.
