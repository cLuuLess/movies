int. woodsmen's hut - day
fanny little writhes in agony.    john rushes in.   tuck
looks up from fanny's side.
                       friar
         the child comes early.
fanny screams.   john kneels beside her, taking her head.
                         little john
         hush, m'lass.    ya'll be fine.
                       fanny
         's not like t'others, john.    oh
         god, it pains me so.

                       little john
                (angrily, to tuck)
         ya're sittin' thar like a fat
         sow. help her, man, help her!
                       friar
         i am doing all i can.
aslan appears in the doorway, with robin. whips back the
blanket. fanny's chest is covered with black squirming
creatures.
                       aslan
         by allah, leeches!
he starts to pull the parasites off.    tuck jumps at him.
                       friar
         get away from her!
aslan pushes him away, continuing his work.

                       aslan
         blood is like air. if she loses
         blood, she and the child will die.
john is paralyzed with confusion.    tuck appeals to robin.
                       friar
         he lies. he is the devil's seed,
         sent to lead us astray.
                       aslan
         fool, both the bible and the koran
         instruct us to preserve life.
tuck raises an arm to strike aslan. robin blocks the
blow. aslan gently touches the mother's stomach.
                                             (continued)

                                                       81.
continued:
                       aslan
                (soothing)
         your baby has not turned. it
         cannot be born without help.
                       friar
         what do you know, you damned
         savage?
                       aslan
                (to john)
         if you will allow me, i can help
         her. it will not be without
         danger.

                       friar
         do not listen to him!   he will
         kill her.
                       aslan
         if you do not listen to me, she
         will certainly die. and the
         child, too.
fanny cries out.   john looks to robin, pleading for
advice.
                       robin
         the good friar has done all he
         can. i suggest you let the arab
         try.
                (as john is
                 undecided)
         if i am wrong, and they die, then
         you may take my life.

john's eyes meet his wife's.   she nods.
                        little john
         so be it.
                       friar
         then it will be on your head.
         i have warned you.
he storms out.   all business, aslan speaks to wulf.
                       aslan
         bring me a needle, thread, water,
         a skinning knife, and burning
         ashes.
wulf runs to obey. john looks horrified. robin eases
him outside, then returns to aslan's side. they
whisper.
                                          (continued)

                                                         82.
continued:
                        robin
          what are you going to do?
                        aslan
          the child must be taken out by
          the knife.
                          robin
          the knife?
                        aslan
          i have seen it many times with
          horses.
                       robin
          horses? by the lord, what are
          her chances?
                        aslan
          after wasting so much blood...
          not good.
                        robin
          now you tell me!
wulf runs back in.     aslan holds up a piece of wood.
                        aslan
                 (to fanny)
          are you ready?... bite down on
          this... robin, hold her steady.
he lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes.

outside

little john paces. wulf comes out of the hut.      families
hover and wait. from inside, muffled groans.
                        friar
          i tell you, the barbarian is
          killing her.
john moves to the hut.     wulf restrains him.

inside
the mother heaves, then drops.
                          robin
          is she gone?
                                             (continued)

                                                       83.
continued:
aslan ignores him, keeps working over fanny's body.
robin cannot watch... a wail! aslan mutters something
in awed arabic.
                       robin
         what did you say?
aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant.
                        aslan
         it is a boy.
the mother revives.   aslan places the child on her
breast.

                       aslan
         your son, my lady... robin, hold
         her skin together while i sew her
         up.
he picks up the needle and thread.   robin's eyes turn to
the woman's abdomen... he faints.
                                             cut to:

little john
marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn
child high for all to see. tuck sits miserably to one
side. bloody and  exhausted, aslan appears at the hut
door. tuck jumps  to his feet, drawing his knife.
heads turn. tense silence. robin appears, unsteadily,
behind aslan. watches, ready to intervene. tuck stares
at aslan. raises his blade... and slices down across
his own wrist.
                       friar
         this day god has taught me a fine
         lesson.
he hands aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist.
                       friar
         i would be honored.
aslan slices his own wrist. the two wrists clasp
together in the universal sign of brotherhood. everyone
cheers.
                       friar
         you are a good man, my barbarian
         friend.
                       (more)
                                             (continued)

                                                       84.
continued:
                       friar (cont'd)
         we shall open a barrel together
         and i shall do my damndest to
         save your heathen soul.
                       aslan
         alas, i am not permitted...
                       friar
         our god made this brew, brother.
         i merely combined the ingredients.
         do you dare to insult his works?
