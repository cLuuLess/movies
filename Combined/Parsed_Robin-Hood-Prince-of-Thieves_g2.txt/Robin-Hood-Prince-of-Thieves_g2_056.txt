ext. caves
squawking ominously, crows burst from the trees. robin
rides up the path to the caves that his father took.
checks the ground. horse tracks. he dismounts, moves
cautiously forward.


pov through scope - circle of stones
no one visible. debris. smoke rises from ashes.
remnants of a recent ceremony.

back to scene
robin climbs silently down the rocks into the stone
circle. there is blood on the sacrificial altar.
through the opening of the cave, he spies a woman's form,
lying face down.
                       robin
                (under his breath)
         marian!
                                           (continued)

                                                       90.
continued:
he runs forward. turns the body over. skin chalk-white
from loss of blood... sarah! a shadow falls across
robin. before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into
blackness.
