int. dungeon - dusk
the sound of the gallows echoes inside the damp, stone
walls. wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings
in the floor. wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light
high in the wall. the purple sky is turning black. he
fingers his wooden crucifix.
                         wulf
           if it be your biddin' that this be
           my last night o' life, lord, gimme
           the pluck to die proud. an' look
           'ee kindly on my folks an' the
           young 'uns.
the light in the cell melts to total darkness.

                                             dissolve to:

branches
sunlight glistens on frost-laden branches.      a cock robin
chirps.
