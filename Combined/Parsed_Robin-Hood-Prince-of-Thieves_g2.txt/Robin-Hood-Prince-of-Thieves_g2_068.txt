ext. sherwood forest - night
a winter's night. bitterly    cold.  sad figures huddled
around a small fire. fanny    tends to john's wounds, their
little ones asleep by their   feet.  john drinks and passes
the jug to tuck, who numbly   shakes his head. too
depressed even to drink.
aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to robin, who
sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness.
                       robin
         my pride brought us to this.
                       aslan
         no, friend. it was you who gave
         these men pride.
                       robin
         i gave them nothing but false
         hope. tomorrow we will disperse.
         these people can move south and
         start over. you must go home and
         win your jasmina.

                         aslan
         and you?
                       robin
         i am no longer your responsibility.
                       aslan
         that is for me to decide.
                       robin
                (raging)
         damn you, arab. i want you out of
         my life. can't you understand
         that? go home. go back to your
         own kind.
aslan stares at him, then turns away. not the time for
argument. robin fingers his father's medallion... rips
it from his neck.
                                          (continued)

                                                      102.
continued:
                       robin
         damn you, too, father.   you reared
         a coward and a fool.
he hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging
branch.
                                            cut to:

november moon
watery, full. the focus shifts to the medallion,
dangling in its center... the last thing robin sees
before his eyes close into troubled sleep. the white
moon against the black sky...
                                            dissolve to:

its negative image
-- a black circle against a white sky. an executioner.
the round medallion has become a noose.
in the noose appears wulf's face. the executioner hauls
on the rope and wulf's features contort in the agony of
death. another noose, another face... duncan. another
-- bull. another -- marian.
                       marian
         kiss me, robin.
the noose tightens on her neck. as she dies, her face
shrivels into the cackling features of mortianna.

next, robin's father.   he stares accusingly right at us.
                       locksley
         why have you betrayed me?   why?
before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his
hood... it is robin. gloating, he hauls on the rope.
his laughter blends with that of mortianna in a hideous
cacophony.
                                            dissolve to:

robin's face
distorted in water. the laughter becomes the sound of
a running river. robin is washing, trying to drive away
the horror.
                                            (continued)

                                                         103.
continued:
the first streaks of light fight their way through a
thick, morning mist. out of the mist steps a figure,
at first indecipherable. aware of his presence,
robin looks up.
                         robin
         will!    i thought you were taken.
                         will scarlet
         i was.
                       robin
         how did you escape?
                       will scarlet
         i promised to kill you.
                         robin
         and will you?
before will can answer, little john runs up.     grabs
will's throat.
                       little john
         i'll wring yer scrawny neck, will
         scarlet. i'd be doin' yer a
         bloody favor an' all.
quickly, others arrive. aslan, tuck, hal, fanny, with
kids clinging to her skirts.
                       fanny
         afore ya kill 'im, john, ask 'im
         if wulf be still alive.
will is choking, unable to speak. john loosens his hold
just enough for will to splutter out...
                         will scarlet
         y... e...
                       little john
         git us a rope, hal, and we'll put
         the bleedin' weasel outa 'is
         misery.
                         robin
         john, wait.    let us hear what he
         has to say.
                       little john
         no bugger 'scapes the sheriff,
         'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin'
         pockets.
                                              (continued)

                                                     104.
continued:
                       robin
         a traitor sneaks in and out under
         cover of darkness. will walked in
         and announced himself.
                         little john
                  (dismissive)
         aye.    'e always did 'ave balls o'
         brass.
                       hal
         let's sss... string 'im up.
                       robin
         let him speak.

john reluctantly moves his hold from will's neck to his
shoulders.
                       little john
         search 'im, hal. 'e'll 'ave a
         bloody blade on 'im somewheres.
will eyes the accusing faces. hal searches, lifts will's
shirt. his whole skin is lacerated with deep gashes and
fresh burns.
                         little john
         bugger me.
he steps back.    ready to listen.
                       will scarlet
         i bring a message from nottingham.
         our men are to be hung in the
         square on saturday. at high noon.

                       fanny
         what about my boy?
                         will scarlet
         the boy, too.    ten men in all.
fanny drops her head on john's shoulder.
                         will scarlet
         their   deaths are a warning.
         anyone   who associates with the
         outlaw   hood is to suffer the same
         fate.    man, woman, or child. even
         anyone   who so much as utters his
         name.
                                            (continued)

                                                       105.
continued:
                       friar
         robin hood! robin hood! robin
         hood!
                (chuckles)
         may as well be hung for a sheep as
         a lamb.
                       will scarlet
         the hangings are to be part of the
         celebration for the sheriff's
         marriage.
                       little john
         marriage, eh? what lucky wench
         gits to play with the sheriff's
         codpiece?
will turns his gaze directly on robin.
                        will scarlet
         lady marian.
                       friar
         he takes a bride of royal blood?
                       little john
         aye, and then with king richard
         gone, he takes the bloody throne.
everyone reacts with shock.     only robin appears unsur-
prised.
                       robin
         you were to use this news to get
         close to me, and then kill me?
         right, will?

                       will scarlet
                (sly grin)
         not straightway, of course.
                       robin
         what is your intention, will?
                       will scarlet
         that depends on you, locksley.
                        robin
         how so?
                       will scarlet
         i've never trusted you, that's no
         secret. what i wanna know is, are
         you gonna finish what you started?
                                             (continued)

                                                       106.
continued:
robin is on the spot.    all eyes on him.   will presses his
point.
                       will scarlet
         will ya stay and keep us fightin'
         till every man jack of us is dead?
         or will you run like the spoiled
         little rich boy i always took you
         for?
                       robin
         you present quite a choice.    what
         would you have me do, will?
                       will scarlet
         if you run, i will kill you.
                       robin
         and if i stay, will you all stay
         with me?
robin checks the other faces.
                       aslan
         to the end, friend.
                       friar
         if my heathen brother stays, i
         stay.
                       hal
         mmmm... meee... tttt...
he can't get it out.    little john covers hal's mouth.
                       little john
         'e's in. we're all bloody in.
         daft buggers.
                       robin
         there's your answer, will.    we
         finish it.
