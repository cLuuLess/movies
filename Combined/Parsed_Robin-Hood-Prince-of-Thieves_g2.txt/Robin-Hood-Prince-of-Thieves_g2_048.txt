ext. country road - day

hooves fly along a track. sarah and the courier.    the
courier reins in, sarah draws alongside.
                       sarah
         what is wrong?
                       courier
         my horse seems to be favoring
         a foreleg.
sarah leans down to look and the courier cudgels her
across the neck. she falls from the saddle, unconscious.
