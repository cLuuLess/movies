ext./int. peasant's cottage - day
crash! an armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's
hovel. children scream and run. a soldier clubs at
them, laughing.
outside. more soldiers. some on horses, others on foot,
with leashed hounds. pillaging. vandalizing.
searching.
guy gisborne: an impressive figure on horseback.
strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is
missing. we recognize his face from the druid ceremony.
he coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her
arms, fanny.
                       gisborne
         you owe the sheriff three bushels
         of flax.
                       fanny
         you starve us. first the drought,
         now you take what food we have
         left.
                       gisborne
         for starving people, you look
         fat enough.
                       soldier
                (emerging from
                 the hut)
         he's not here, sir. none but the
         woman and children.
                       gisborne
                (to fanny)
         where is your mate? the man
         they call little.
                       fanny
         he died last winter.
                       gisborne
         is that so? we hear he     is very
         much alive. hiding out     in the
         forest. he probably ran     away
         to escape your scolding    tongue.
the soldiers join in his laughter. incensed, fanny
pounds her fist on his legs. gisborne kicks her down.
                         fanny
         norman swine!
a boy of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at
gisborne's throat.
                                           (continued)

                                                        15.
continued:
                       fanny
         no, wulf! don't! 'twill only
         make it worse.
wulf backs off.   nostrils flaring with repressed hate.
                        gisborne
         seize him!
while two soldiers grab the boy, others examine his
hiding place. a secret thatched door, built into the
side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer
carcass. gisborne dismounts.
                       gisborne
         this is lord nottingham's deer.
         is this how you repay the sheriff
         for his protection?
                       wulf (boy)
         like a wolf protects sheep.
                        fanny
         i killed it.   we needed the meat.
                       gisborne
         poachers hang. either he dies or
         you die.
                       wulf
         my mother lies to protect me.
                        fanny
         no, wulf!
gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.

                       gisborne
         you have deprived us of a hunt,
         boy.
he cups his hand in the deer's blood.    smears it on
wulf's face.
                       gisborne
         the hounds know the scent well.
he tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. they tear at
each other in their effort to rip at the glove.
                       gisborne
         run, boy. like a deer. give us
         some pleasure before you die.
                                            (continued)

                                                       16.
continued:
to the accompaniment of the hounds' savage howls and
the horrified screams of his family, wulf runs.
                         gisborne
         unleash them!
