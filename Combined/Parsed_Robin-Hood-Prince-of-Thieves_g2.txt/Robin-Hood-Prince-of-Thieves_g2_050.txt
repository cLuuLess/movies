int. dubois mansion - kitchen - night
marian enters stealthily. a candle in one hand, a
drawn dagger in the other. something leaps at her!...
a cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. she
shoos him down.
                       marian
         off, nicodemus. go find mice.
she sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind.   a
masked soldier.
                                           (continued)

                                                        85.
continued:
                       soldier
         we meet again.
he reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his
mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. he prods
her with his sword.
                       soldier
         drop your blade.
                       marian
         you are still overmatched, soldier.
she drops the sword. he hurls her against the table.
lays his blade against her chest.

                       soldier
         you owe me favors, wench. bare
         your breasts... or i will do it
         for you.
resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her
dress. with the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs
a pepper bowl. flips the contents into his face.
screaming, he grabs his  face. she reaches for her
dagger. he slashes with   his sword. she backs to the
fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives
the point clean through  his chest.
he stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the
cooked fowls pinned to his breast... footsteps... masked
soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging
the servants. duncan  is shoved through the door.
                       duncan
         i am sorry, my lady.    there were
         too many.
she stares at the invaders with studied calm.
                       marian
         is there something you need,
         gentlemen? i remember no masked
         ball on my calendar.
                                              cut to:

aerial shot
flying low over treetops, over an expanse of green,
intersected by brown roads and tracks. we are looking
at a detailed scale model of sherwood forest in...

                                                      86.
