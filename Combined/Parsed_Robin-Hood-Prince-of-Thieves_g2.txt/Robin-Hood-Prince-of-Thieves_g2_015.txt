int. nottingham castle - night
face like thunder, guy of gisborne strides up curving,
stone steps. a long corridor leads to a guarded oak
door.
                       sentry
         sir guy. his lordship is not to
         be disturbed.
                        gisborne
         away, fool.
he shoves the sentry aside.
