ext. woodsmen's camp - day
men gather around as robin dismounts, admiring the horse.

                       robin
         a personal loan from the sheriff.
                       aslan
                (furious)
         you should not have left without
         me, englishman.
                       robin
         how so? you have not raised a
         finger to protect me.
                       aslan
         before i had a choice.
                       robin
         it was my choice to do this alone.
                                            (continued)

                                                       60.
continued:
                       aslan
         a foolish risk. if you had been
         killed, i would be cursed for
         eternity for failing to fulfil
         my pledge.
                       robin
         aslan, if i didn't know better,
         i would swear you were worried
         about me.
