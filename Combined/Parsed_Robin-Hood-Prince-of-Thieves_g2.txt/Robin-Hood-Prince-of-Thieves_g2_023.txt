ext. stream
water erupts under hooves. aslan fords a stream. duncan
hangs on for dear life. robin strives to keep up. half
a mile behind gisborne splits up his men.
trying for a short cut, robin finds himself at the
steepest part of the river gorge. his horse balks at the
drop. robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. it
backs away.
                       robin
         damn you, animal!
aslan shouts from the far bank.
                       aslan
         treat it like a woman.
robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. closing
in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. a flight of
bolts whistles ominously close to robin. he must jump or
die.
                       aslan
         have you never had a woman?
         gently, man. soothe it!
                                           (continued)

                                                         39.
continued:
                       robin
         of course i've had a woman!
         come on, pretty one.
he pats the horse soothingly.    the animal edges forward.
                        aslan
         softly.   with your knees.
                        robin
         i know!   i know!
the soldiers reload.   robin urges the horse at the steep
drop.

                         robin
         easy, easy.
another wave of crossbow bolts. robin launches the
frightened animal into space. hooves flail... touch
down. scramble up the other bank. robin
enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
                         robin
         i love you!
the first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     their
mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
                       gisborne
                (yelling)
         robin of the hood! son of the
         devil worshipper.
                       robin
         what is your pleasure, gisborne?

                       gisborne
         it was i who strung your father's
         corpse to the castle gate. my
         pleasure will be in doing the same
         to you.
                       robin
         you survived one meeting.    our next
         will be your last.
                       gisborne
         your father died a coward, cursing
         your name and squealing like a
         stuck pig.
                         robin
         that's a lie!
                                            (continued)

                                                     40.
continued:
incensed, he is losing his judgement.
                          aslan
                   (shouts)
            come, robin! he is trying to
            anger you into a trap.
a shaft pierces the flank of robin's horse. it rears in
fright. robin clings on. six soldiers, the men gisborne
split off, are climbing the embankment towards him.
robin regains control. rides right at them. scatters
them, and takes off again. gisborne yells at his men to
follow.

robin and aslan ride flat out. open land turns to scrub.
seeing no followers, robin pulls up and dismounts.
                          robin
            we have lost them. i'll lame this
            mare if i ask her to go any farther.
he gently extracts the shaft from his horse. aslan opens
his pouch. pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square
leather hide. rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds
it to his eye. a primitive telescope.
robin watches, curious.

scope pov
through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind
them.


back to scene
                          aslan
            here they come. look.
robin puts the device to his eye...

scope pov
the soldiers are close!

back to scene
he reacts in shock. prepares to defend himself.    then
realizes they are still in the distance.
                                            (continued)

                                                      41.
continued:
                       robin
         is this arab magic?
                         aslan
         no.    arab science.
he replaces the tube in his pouch.
                       aslan
         how did your uneducated
         kind ever take jerusalem?
                        robin
         god knows!

aslan laughs.   robin points towards an endless expanse of
trees.
                       robin
         we can lose them in the forest.
                       duncan
         sherwood is haunted, master.
                       robin
         either we take our chances
         with the ghosts, or become
         ghosts ourselves.
he remounts. they race into the trees. gisborne's men
thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. peering
around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. robin
looks back.
                       robin
         they're not following.

gisborne curses his men, urging them on.
                       gisborne
         come on, damn you! there are
         only three of them.
                       soldier
         it's not the men we fear, sir.
eerie howling and rattling of bones.    aslan draws his
sword.
                       duncan
         banshees. they say they fly in
         your mouth and suck you dry of
         blood before you can scream.
he wraps his scarf over his mouth.
                                            (continued)

                                                       42.
continued:
                         robin
         be quiet!    listen.
wind gusts the trees in angry waves. emits deathly
shrieks. the horses whinney. unnerved, aslan smites
around him with his scimitar. wheels at the sounds,
striking only air.
                       aslan
         allah protect us from the evil
         spirits.
duncan clings to his back.   robin points.
                        robin
         behind you!
aslan slashes out, futilely.
                         robin
         no, there!    and there!
aslan flails.   robin cracks up.
                       aslan
         cease your mad laughing.     i can
         feel them.
robin reaches into the branches. pulls out a string of
hollowed wooden tubes -- windchimes. dozens of such
strings on all the trees. he blows over the hollow end.
a low chilling moan.
                       robin
         here are your ghosts, duncan. a
         child's toy put to good use. you
         scare easily, my painted saladin.
his laughter is broken by a piercing yell. a red-
jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope.
catapults him to the ground.
the bushes are instantly alive. shaggy, wild-eyed men,
armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. twelfth-
century hell's angels. the red-jacketed young turk, will
scarlet, leaps around robin.
                       will scarlet
                (singing)
         ring around the rosie!
                        robin
         aslan!
aslan makes no move to intervene.
                                              (continued)

                                                       43.
continued:
the woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their
distance from him. will kicks at robin, who tries to
grab him. will skips out of range. robin falls.
                       will scarlet
         atishoo, atishoo. we all fall
         down. beg for mercy, rich man.
                       robin
         i beg of no man. which of you
         scum has guts enough to face
         me man to man?
                       voice (o.s.)
         yeah, bollocks, mate.

robin looks up... i mean up! a towering figure. seven
feet of grinning, muscled brute. the giant extends a
vice that passes for a hand. hauls robin to his feet.
his eyes twinkle with merriment. his whole body shakes
when he laughs, which is often.
                       john little
         what are ya, m'old cock?
                       robin
         er... robin...
he pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
                        robin
         ...hood.   robin hood.   who are
         you?
                        john little
         john little.   bestman o' the
         woods.
                        robin
         bestman?   you lead this rabble?
                       will scarlet
         we waste time. tax him.
                        robin
         tax?   for what?
                       will scarlet
         for passage through sherwood.
                       robin
         i will pay no tax. besides, i
         have nothing but my cloak and
         my sword.
                                            (continued)

                                                       44.
continued:
                       will scarlet
         a man who travels with two servants
         and claims he's without money, is
         either a fool or a liar.
grabbing robin, little shakes him like a doll. something
clinks. robin's father's medallion. laughing heartily,
little rips it from robin's neck and tosses it to scarlet.
                       will scarlet
         and this one is a liar.
                (he bites the metal)
         ahah! gold!
the men cheer.   john snatches the medallion back from
will.
                       robin
         that is sacred to me.
                       john little
         sacred to us too, mush. this
         here'll feed us for a bloomin'
         month.
robin draws his sword.
                       robin
         you will have to fight me for it.
                       john little
         i'd love to, mate.
he grins hugely.   a boy pushes his way through the throng.
                         wulf
         wait, father!    i know him.
                       robin
         this man is your father? tell him
         how i saved your hide from the
         sheriff's soldiers. that deserves
         some gratitude, i believe.
he reaches for the medallion.    john pulls it away.
                       john little
         naw ya don't, laddie.
                       will scarlet
         you must be robin of locksley.
         the blackguard who abandoned us to
         nottingham's plundering.
                                            (continued)

                                                     45.
continued:
                       wulf
         be careful, father. he fights
         like a demon. he walloped six o'
         sheriff's men?
                        john little
         is that so?
another grin. licking his lips in anticipation, he
lunges for robin's wrist. wrenches the sword free.
bends it into a pretzel.
                        robin
         aslan!

aslan shrugs. robin swings a fist into the giant's gut.
john doesn't flinch. hoists robin off the ground with
one arm. cannonballs the other fist into robin's
stomach. robin folds.
                       will scarlet
         oh dear! the little rich boy is
         lost for words. thanks for the
         taxes, locksley.
                       john little
         and for the laughs.
the woodsmen find this hysterical. they disappear into
the tree. will administers one final kick before
leaving. robin staggers to his feet. glares furiously
at aslan.
                       robin
         son of an arab whore! once again
         your assistance was invaluable.

                       aslan
         you seemed more in danger of losing
         your pride than your life.
                       duncan
         i recognized some of the voices.
         many were from your father's farms.
                       aslan
         your avenging army, my friend.
                        robin
         that rabble?
                       aslan
         all they need is a leader.
                                           (continued)

                                                     46.
continued:
                       robin
         they have a leader.   a very large
         one.
                       aslan
         defeat him and they will follow
         you.
                       robin
         allah has taken your brains.
                       duncan
         i hear the voice of a spoiled
         child, master robin. i suggest
         you cease your brave talk of
         revenge and flee to the north.
                       robin
         you, too? you expect me to
         fight that behemoth?
                       duncan
         your father would expect you to
         act like a man.
                                           cut to:
