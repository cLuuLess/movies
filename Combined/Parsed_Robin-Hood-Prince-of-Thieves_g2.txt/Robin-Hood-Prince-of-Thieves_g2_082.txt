john strains, heaving his giant frame up the rope. he
nears the top, just as a sentry approaches. fanny blocks
the man's view.
                       sentry
         what is your business, woman?
                       fanny
         ain't doin' no 'arm, m'dear.
         likes a good 'angin', i do. luvly
         view up 'ere, ain't it?
she gestures below. the sentry looks, then turns back to
her... notices the rope. with all her might, fanny rams
his head into the stone battlement. twice. three times.
he slumps unconscious.
