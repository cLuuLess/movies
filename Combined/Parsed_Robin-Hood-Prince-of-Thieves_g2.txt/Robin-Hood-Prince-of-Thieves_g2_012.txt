ext. country road - dusk
nearing home, robin is buoyant.     the saracen, brooding,
walks two paces behind him.
                       robin
         why must you walk in back of me?

                       aslan
         in your land am i not the infidel?
         the unbeliever, the instrument of
         evil?
                       robin
         our races have fought for a
         hundred years to prove that point.
                       aslan
         then i trust it is safer to appear
         as your slave than as your equal.
                       robin
         for an 'infidel' you have uncommon
         clarity of thinking. yet you
         refuse to tell me about your home
         and family.
                       aslan
         those are my burdens.

                       robin
         you speak my language. you have
         the diplomacy and honor code of
         a nobleman. i ask again, why
         were you to be executed?
the saracen maintains a moody silence.
                       robin
         so, i must continue with my
         guesswork. you are highborn?
         probably... you fell from favor...
         clearly... why? you broke the
         law? you were a rival for power?
         ... a woman?
                                             (continued)

                                                        17.
continued:
the saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.
                          robin
            by the lord, that's it!
aslan is silent, but robin knows he's right.
                          robin
            they say there are arab women of
            such beauty that they can possess
            a man's mind, that he would be
            willing to die for them. is
            that not so?
ignoring him, the saracen stops.      examines the darkening
sky.
                          aslan
            it is close to sunset.
                          robin
            your people must marry women
            chosen for them by others, right?
no reply.    aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
                          robin
            who is she? the mullah's daughter?
            ... another man's wife?... that's
            it!
                          aslan
            endless clouds. is there no sun
            in your cursed country?
                          robin
            you dog! you painted old dog!
            what is her name?
                          aslan
            which way is east?
                         robin
            her name?
                         aslan
            east?
                         robin
            her name?
                         aslan
            east?!!!
robin folds his arms.    a standoff.
                                              (continued)

                                                       18.
continued:
                       aslan
         damn you!... jasmina.
                         robin
         ah, jasmina!    is she beautiful?
                       aslan
         which way is east?
                         robin
         that way.
aslan throws his rug on the ground.    kneels.
                         aslan
         are you sure?
                       robin
         i would know blindfolded. i'm
         five miles from home... was she
         worth it?
                       aslan
         worth dying for.
robin stands smiling over him as aslan begins his
prayers... baying of hunting dogs... in the distance, the
boy wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs
the leading dog with a branch. the other hounds close
in... panting with exhaustion, wulf swings into the
branches. a hound savages his leg.
the soldiers surround the tree. the boy clambers
precariously onto the highest branch... robin surrep-
titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers'
horses.

                       gisborne
         you're not playing by    the rules,
         boy. deer don't climb     trees...
         perhaps he thinks he's    a game
         bird. shall we teach     him to fly?
         cut it down!
the soldiers hack at the trunk.    the tree quivers.
                       robin
         hold!... i am curious as to what
         manner of creature is so fearsome
         that it takes six men to attack
         it.
shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches
them.
                                             (continued)

                                                      19.
continued:
                       gisborne
         stand back, stranger. this is no
         affair of yours.
                       robin
         have we treed the devil himself?
         let me see... ah ha! a small boy.
         a truly dangerous animal.
                       gisborne
         i advise you to move on, pilgrim.
         this is the sheriff's land.
                       robin
         wrong. this is my land, and my
         tree. therefore, whatever is in
         it also belongs to me.
                       gisborne
         i grow dangerously tired of your
         wit... chop it down!
                       robin
         the man who strikes that tree
         dies.
he glances nervously at aslan, who's still at his
prayers. the men stop in mid-swing. more surprised
than scared. gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
                       gisborne
         chop down the hooded fool.
                       robin
                (backing up)
         perhaps we could discuss this.

the soldier raises his sword. robin lifts his cape...
the crossbow. shoots from the hip. the bolt thuds
through the man's armor. he's dead before he lands.
                       gisborne
         kill him!
                        robin
         aslan!   it's time to redeem that
         vow.
                       gisborne
         set the dogs on him!
                                             (continued)

                                                        20.
continued:
aslan ignores him, lost in his   prayers. robin lifts the
other arm -- a second concealed   crossbow. whumpf! the
bolt flips the dog handler into   the vicious pack. dead
or not, he soon will be. robin    unsheathes his sword.
                          robin
            aslan, get off your damn knees!
            i have four of them cornered.
the saracen remains head down. or did we see him steal
a glance? gisborne signals his men to attack. a wave of
flashing steel.
                          robin
            i hope there's enough of me to
            satisfy you all.
backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out.
two men fly back. he lunges at a third. his sword
strikes flesh. robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth
onto a sharp tree stump.
gisborne thrusts. robin reacts too slowly.       blood flows
from his arm. his sword falls.
                         robin
            aslan!!
gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      robin
freezes.
                          gisborne
            well, hooded stranger, allow me
            to know your name before i run you
            through.

a moment of silence... like lightning, robin spins,
kicks out gisborne's legs. slams one foot on the man's
sword arm, the other on his throat. throws back his
pilgrim's hood.
                          gisborne
            robin of locksley!
                          robin
            on your knees, gisborne.   pray.
he obeys.    robin raises his sword.
                          gisborne
            please, locksley! no!
robin drives the point into gisborne's rear.      the man
leaps.
                                               (continued)

                                                       21.
continued:
                       robin
         now get off my land. and tell your
         cousin the sheriff what happens to
         his scum when they pick on my
         people.
gisborne takes off, colliding with aslan as he folds his
rug. reacts in shock at the sight of the strange arab.
keeps running.
                       robin
                (to aslan,
                 furious)
         you worthless savage! you travel
         ten thousand miles to save my life,
         then leave me to be butchered.
                       aslan
         i will fulfill my vow when i
         choose.
                       robin
         which does not include prayer
         times, meal times, or any time
         i'm outnumbered six to one!!
                       aslan
         you whine like a mule.   you are
         still alive.
                       robin
         barely.
aslan examines robin's wound.   dismissive.
                       aslan
         a flesh wound. why did you let
         their leader go?
                       robin
         after six years of the stench of
         death, i have no stomach for
         needless blood on my hands.
wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
                       robin
         have no fear, boy.
the boy nervously eyes robin and the saracen, fingering
a crucifix around his neck. runs off into the woods.
                       aslan
                (laughing)
         the conquering hero returns.
                                              (continued)

                                                          22.
continued:
                        robin
         ha!   it was you he was scared of.
aslan's humor is infectious.     robin's anger relents.
                       robin
         come, my strange friend. beyond
         that hill lies the prettiest
         little castle in all christendom.
         warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
                       aslan
         with feather pillows?
                       robin
         with feather pillows. warm and
         soft like jasmina's embrace.
