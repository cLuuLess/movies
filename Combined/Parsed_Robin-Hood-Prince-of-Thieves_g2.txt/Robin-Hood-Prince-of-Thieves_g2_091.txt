ext. castle gate - day
robin leaps onto tuck's cart.
                       robin
         light all the barrels, tuck.
                                             (continued)

                                                    122.
continued:
robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across
the yard. bouncing in the back, tuck lights barrels.
fuses smoke and crackle.
                       robin
         jump!
tuck jumps. robin steers the wagon at the gate. at the
last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the
horse's back... the barrels explode! the portcullis is
blown to kingdom come.
out of the smoke, robin rides the old nag like a charger.
leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.
