ext. wooded trail
kenneth checks the ground.    locksley waits.
                       kenneth
         they came this way, my lord.
                         locksley
         onward then.    what is this place?
                                              (continued)

                                                    10.
continued:
                       kenneth
         nearby the gregor caves.
locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. they move on...
ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
strange primitive chants, wafted on the wind. locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
parting undergrowth, kenneth creeps forward. cries out.
he's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
kenneth turns to run... a hand grabs him.

                       locksley
         steady, man. they are to dissuade
         the faint of heart. think of
         gwen.
from the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. a cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. before the cave, a
circle of stones. a miniature stonehenge.
a medieval orgy. men and women in masks and loose
robes. dancing. drinking. reveling. pure carnality.
lord locksley and kenneth watch in horror. faces ashen.
                       kenneth
         druids.
                       locksley
         i trusted we were rid of such evil
         a century ago.

an unearthly screech. a creature leaps into the circle
of stones. grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. a living hieronymous bosch demon. its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. the creature tastes the blood.
the reveler is ecstatic.
                       kenneth
                (petrified)
         is it the devil?
                       locksley
         if it is, i have some christian
         steel that will test his hide.
he draws his sword. a crucifix sculpted into the hilt.
a girl is dragged from the cave. kenneth buries his
head.
                                          (continued)

                                                      11.
continued:
                       locksley
         gwen?
kenneth nods.
the demon shrieks, dervishing around gwen, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. a pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. a
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   the high
priest of the dark rite.
the girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. the demon's voice is husky and hideous.
                       demon
         come, my virgin flower.
hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, gwen stretches herself out. a single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. the
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. the
demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. the crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. awed anticipation...
a warrior's yell!
sword raised, locksley thunders in on his charger. the
terrified crowd parts. the demon screams like a banshee.
                        demon
         kill him!   kill him!
the followers throw themselves at   locksley. he beats
them off. the high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. one aims a    spear. locksley hacks
the shaft in half. cuts men down    left and right.
reaches the altar stone.
                        locksley
         gwen!   up, girl, up!
gwen shakes off her trance. the demon launches itself at
locksley. talons rip flesh from his face. with all his
strength, locksley hurls the creature down.
                       locksley
         in the name of god!
his broadsword swings in a mighty arc. slices across the
gargoyle's skull. clean through half the face...
impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet.
                                            (continued)

                                                    12.
continued:
the head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
momentarily stunned, locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. the guards close in.
locksley spurs his horse. rides for an opening.
the masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
brandishing a burning branch. the horse is freaked.
rears. locksley and the girl are thrown.
unarmed, locksley charges the man. slams him into the
cave wall. the mask falls. locksley gasps in
recognition.


                        locksley
         nottingham!
the sheriff of nottingham. powerful build, black beard,
cruel intensity in every feature.
                       nottingham
         you are an unwelcome surprise,
         locksley.
                       locksley
         the king shall hear of this,
         nottingham.
                        nottingham
         i think not.
locksley is surrounded. one by one the men reveal their
faces. locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.

                        locksely
         god help us.
                       nottingham
         one day all england will worship
         with us.
                        locksley
         never.
the crone spits venom in his face.
                       demon
         i am mortianna. you will die with
         my name on your lips.
locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. on the hill-
side, kenneth averts his eyes. turns to run. five
masked figures block his way.

                                                         13.
