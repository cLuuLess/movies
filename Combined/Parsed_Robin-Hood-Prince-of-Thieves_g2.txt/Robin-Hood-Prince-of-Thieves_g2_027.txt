ext. road to nottingham - day

duncan walks alone, with the aid of his staff. body
stooped, clothes ragged, a pathetic figure. ahead is
the main gate to the walled city of nottingham.
fresh horse manure. a man's hand reaches into it and
spreads it over his clothes. and his face -- robin,
dressed as duncan.
