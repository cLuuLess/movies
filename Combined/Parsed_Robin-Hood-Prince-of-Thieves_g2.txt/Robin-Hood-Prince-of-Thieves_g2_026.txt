ext. woodsmen's camp - sunrise
a steady trickle of rain drips from leaves onto the nose
of the sleeping saracen. he wakes, cursing. all around
him the woodsmen lie on the forest floor, covered with
rags and hides coughing and sneezing. a sorry mess.
robin sits, brooding.
                                            (continued)

                                                       53.
continued:
                       aslan
                (gloomily)
         i have led you wrong. this is no
         army. these men live like dogs.
                         robin
         english dogs.    they can learn.
                        aslan
         learn what?   to build kennels?
he sullenly stalks away. robin shakes his head. aslan
is right. he rouses duncan, who is asleep at his side.
the old man groans awake, holding his head. seriously
hung-over.

                       robin
         too much mead, old friend.    what
         day is it?
                       duncan
         sunday, i believe.
                       robin
         good. do they still give alms
         to the poor at the mass?
                       duncan
         they do. these days the need for
         mercy is greater than ever.
                       robin
         then i must ask you a favor.
