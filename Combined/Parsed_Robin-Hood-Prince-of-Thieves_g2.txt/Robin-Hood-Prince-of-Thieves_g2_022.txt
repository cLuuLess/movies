ext. dubois mansion - day
rock-strewn hills. grazing sheep. sun peeking through
clouds. robin and marian walk. anger and anguish in
her voice.
                       marian
         why would he wish me to be
         protected by the boy who burned
         my hair when i was a child?
                       robin
         we were together five terrible
         years in a saracen prison.
                       marian
         how do i know you didn't abandon
         him there to save your own skin.
robin hands her peter's ring.   she is shocked.
                       robin
         marian, i'm sorry.

                       marian
         i will forward your condolences
         to my mother.
she turns her back.   he searches for a way to reach her.
                       robin
         on my return, i found my father
         dead. the sheriff denounced him
         as a druid and took our lands.
                       marian
         the people fear the druids so much
         they'd believe anything.
         nottingham would have me burned at
         the stake as a witch if he thought
         he could possess my property.
                                            (continued)

                                                      36.
continued:
                       robin
         why do you not join your mother
         in london? you would be safer
         there.
                       marian
         i will not retreat.     besides, i
         have no interest in    life at court.
         gossip-mongering and    currying
         favor. here i am my     own person.
                       robin
         the you must allow me to be your
         guardian.

                       marian
         i do not need a guardian.
she turns to face him.   streaming tears.
                       marian
         my brother is dead. you cannot
         take his place.
robin grabs and holds her.
                       robin
         marian, i don't want to replace
         him.
                       marian
         what do you want?
their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. robin
moves closer. marian begins to respond, then pulls away.

                       marian
         this is wrong.
she runs back to the house. robin stares after her.
aslan appears in the doorway with duncan.
                       aslan
         robin! the old man hears horses.
         approaching fast.
he runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the
hillside.
                       aslan
         twenty or more. in battle armor.
                       marian
         soldiers coming here?     is this
         your protection?
                                             (continued)

                                                      37.
continued:
                       robin
         i killed some of the sheriff's
         men. i fear i have placed you in
         danger.
                       marian
         i can take care of myself. there
         are horses in the stable. go!
aslan runs into the stables.
                       robin
         i'm not leaving.
marian ices him with a glare. aslan reappears, with two
bareback horses. soldiers appear on the crest, led by
gisborne... with a mischievous grin, marian runs to the
soldiers.
                        marian
         stop them!   they're stealing my
         horses!
                       robin
         damn the girl! aslan, can you
         ride?
in answer, aslan grins. leaps onto a horse. with a
single swift move he hoists duncan up behind him and digs
in his heels. the mare leaps forward, and over the
estate wall.
                        robin
         he can ride.
he heads his horse at the wall. it stumbles. barely
clears it. stones fly. robin struggles to hold on.
marian stands directly in gisborne's path.
                       gisborne
         you have been sheltering outlaws,
         lady marian.
                       marian
         they're thieves, you imbecile.
         bring back my horses, or the
         sheriff will know of your
         cowardice.
gisborne knows she is lying.
                                             (continued)

                                                        38.
continued:
                       gisborne
         you're lucky he didn't steal your
         virtue too.
                (to his men)
         a crown to the man who brings me
         locksley's head.
he leads the pursuit.   a soldier hangs back.   grabs
marian's hair.
                       soldier
         a kiss for me, saxon bitch.
                        marian
         kiss this!

she unsheathes the dagger from under her skirt.    jabs
the blade into his wrist.
                       marian
         try me again, if you want to
         leave a hand behind.
shocked and pained, the man gallops away. marian looks
down at her dagger hand. it shakes violently.
                                           cut to:
