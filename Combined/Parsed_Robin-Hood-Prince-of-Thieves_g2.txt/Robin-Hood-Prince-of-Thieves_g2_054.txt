ext. woodsmen's camp - dawn

the friar and the saracen lie head to head on the dewey
grass. tuck  snores. robin shakes aslan, who grabs for
his weapon.  the hangover hits him like a mallet. he
clutches his temples.
                       robin
         the dancing demon! good morning.
                       aslan
                (wincing)
         if it was jehovah who created this
         brew, he is truly wise. he built
         the punishment into the crime.
an arrow whistles into a tree.    robin reacts.
                       robin
         they need help.
