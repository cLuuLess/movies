ext. forest pool - day
water, sparkling with sunlight. bursts, as robin dives
in naked. he luxuriates in the cool water... hoofbeats.
he attempts to hide... too late. four horses emerge from
the trees. bull and hal, with marian and her servant
sarah sandwiched between them. bull has a black eye.
marian jumps down.
                       marian
                (to robin)
         how dare you!
                       robin
         good morning, lady marian.
in response, she starts pelting him with stones.
                       marian
         you send men to drag me from my
         home in the middle of the night,
         like some slave girl? is this
         the way the famous robin hood
         treats a lady?
                       robin
         ah well... er, let me finish this
         bath you wished me to take. then
         i'll explain.
                       marian
         i demand an explanation right now!
                       robin
         if you will be patient, i could
         spare your propriety by...
                       marian
         i will decide when my propriety
         is compromised.
                         robin
         as you wish.
                                            (continued)

                                                     76.
continued:
he wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her.
she casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body,
glistening with water.
                       marian
         how dare you expose yourself to
         me?!
she slugs him. robin stumbles backwards into the water.
bull grins, gesturing to sarah and pointing to his own
black eye.
                       bull
         the big 'un did the same to me.
