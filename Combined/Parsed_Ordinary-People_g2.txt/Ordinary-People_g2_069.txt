               another training session at the swimming pool. conrad is
               heavily swimming in his lane, although he looks tired and
               bored, not really fit for training. he stops, exhausted at
               the end of a row, looks at his friends happily discussing
               by the side of the pool, then at coach salan in his office
               glass booth overlooking the swimming pool. conrad reflects.
