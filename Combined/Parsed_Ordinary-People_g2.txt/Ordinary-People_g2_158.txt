                          we should spend more time playing
                          golf together, you know that?
                          maybe our next vacation, strictly
                          golf. pinehurst, myrtle beach...

                          pinehurst would be nice. i think
                          connie would like pinehurst.
          
                she pulls back and looks at him.
          
                                    beth
                          do you do that deliberately or is
                          it just a reflex?
          
                                    calvin
                          well, you said "vacation", so i
                          just assumed you meant him too.
          
                                    beth
                          i'm surprised you haven't felt the
                          need to call him since we've been
                          here.

                             it's not what you've done, it's
                             what you think i've done. you blame
                             me for the whole thing.

                             and start being a little generous!
                             and start thinking about him for
                             a while!

                             around him everytime he passes an
                             exam? well, i can't do it! i

                             you see how you accept what he says
                             with no questions, and you can't do
                             the same thing to me, can you?

                             and safe, that no one's fallen off
                             a horse, or been hit by a car, or
                             drowned in that swimming pool
                             you're so proud of! and then you
                             come to me and tell me how to be
