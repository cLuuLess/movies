          73   int. conrad's bedroom Â­ evening                              73
          
               conrad enters his room still singing in a low voice.
          
                                        conrad
                            alleluia!
          
               he browses quickly through a pocket book, finds the piece of
               paper inserted in it, picks up phone and dials the number
               written on the paper
          
                                        karen's mother
                            hello?
          
                                      conrad
                            hello. is karen there?
          
                                      karen's mother
                            who's calling, please?
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (continued)
          
                                                                    71.
          73   continued:                                                 73
          
          
                                       conrad
                            it's a friend of hers from
                            hillsboro?
          
                                      karen's mother
                            oh... well, she's ...not home from
                            school yet.
          
                                      conrad
                            oh. um...hmm. just tell her i
                            called. this is conrad. calling.

                            feeling great, and i just wanted
                            to talk to her.
          
                                      karen's mother
                            yes. i will.
          
                                      conrad
                            ok. thank you.
          
                                        karen's mother
                            good bye.
          
               conrad walks nervously around to and fro for a while then
               looks up into directory. he finds jeannine number, writes it
               down "pratt 5556719", then picks up the phone.
          
                                        conrad
                            all right
          
               conrad hangs up, and rehearses what he is going to say, but
               he is yet too shy to call.
                         conrad (cont'd)
                         hello. jeannine. this is conrad.
                         hello. jeannine, this is conrad.
                         hello. jeannine. this is conrad.
                         conrad. conrad? what a dumb name.
                         hello. jeannine. this is bill.
                         uuuuurgh!
          
               conrad takes courage and dials jeannine number.
          
                                        jeannine
                            hello?
          
                                      conrad
                            hello. this is... hello, this is

                            oh...
                                (realizing, more
                                 enthusiastic)
                            oh. hi!

                                                                    72.
          73   continued:                                                 73
          
          
                                      conrad
                            hi. listen. i was... i was
                            wondering if maybe you'd like...to

                                      jeannine
                            you mean, with you? like on a date?
          
                                      conrad
                            well, yeah, we wouldn't have to
                            call it a real date. we could fake
                            it sort of, to see how it goes..
          
               jeannine laughs.
          
                                      jeannine
                            that was dumb. forget it. just
                            forget it. now start over.
          
                                      conrad
                            hi, this is conrad jarrett...
          
                                      jeannine
                                (interrupting) )
