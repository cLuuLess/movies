                his pyjamas, and joins him.

                                         calvin
                             no.
          
                                       conrad
                             yeah, it is. it's my fault.
          
                                       calvin
                             don't do that! don't do that to
                             yourself! it's nobody's fault!

                             for them, you know.
          
                calvin sits down.
          
                                       calvin (cont'd)
                             i don't know why i'm yelling at you
                             for...
          
                                       conrad
                             no, that's right! you're right! you
                             ought to do that more often.
          
                                         calvin
                             oh, yeah?
          
                                       conrad
                             yeah, yeah, haul my ass a little,
                             you know. get after me. the way you
                             used to for him.
          
                                       calvin
                             oh, he needed it. you didn't. you
                             were always so hard on yourself, i
                             never had the heart.
          
                                       conrad
                             oh, dad. don't.
          
                                        calvin
                             no, it's the truth. i... i never
                             worried about you. i just wasn't
                             listening.
          
                                       conrad
                             well, i wasn't putting out many
                             signals then. i don't think you
                             could have done anything.

                                       calvin
                             no, no, no, i should ...i should've
                             got a handle on it somehow.
          
                                       conrad
                             you know, i used to figure you had
                             a handle for everything. you knew
                             it all.
          
                calvin looks at him and laughs briefly at himself.
          
                                       conrad (cont'd)
                             i know that wasn't fair but you
                             always made us feel like everything
                             was gonna be all right. i thought
                             about that a lot lately. i really
                             admire you for it.
          
                calvin is moved.
          
                                       calvin
                             well, don't admire people too much.
                             they'll disappoint you sometimes.
          
                                       conrad
                             i'm not disappointed.
                             i love you.
          
                calvin looks at him, cries and takes him in his arms.
          
                                       calvin
                             i love you too.
          
                they hug each other.
