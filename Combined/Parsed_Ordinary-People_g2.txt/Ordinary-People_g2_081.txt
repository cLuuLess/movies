               bet silently comes in. calvin finally notices she is here.
          
                                      calvin

                            scotch pines. and they all look
                            like skeletons this year.
          
               conrad comes in with a box of chritsmas tree decorations
          
                                      conrad

               conrad and calvin stop at the tone of her voice.
          
                                      calvin
                            what's wrong?

                                (cold)
                            why don't you ask him what's wrong?
                            maybe you won't have to hear it
                            from carol lazenby.
          
                                         calvin

                                      conrad

                                      calvin

                                      calvin
                            why didn't you tell us, connie?
          
                                      conrad
                            i don't know, i didn't think it
                            mattered.
          
                                      calvin
                            what do you mean? why wouldn't it
                            matter? of course it matters.
                            and...

                            oh? and how do i hurt you? by
                            embarrassing you in front of a
                            friend? poor beth! she has no idea
                            what her son is up to! he lies and
                            she believes every word of it.
          
                                      conrad

                            if it's starting all over again,
                            the lying, the covering up, the
                            disappearing for hours, i will
                            not stand for it! i can't stand

                            only reason she gives a fuck about

                            maybe this is how they sit around
                            and talk at the hospital, but we're
                            not at the hospital now.
          
                                      conrad

                            flu   and couldn't come inside, but
                            she   came.

                            if buck was in the hospital!
                            she would have come if buck was
