               beth and conrad are having lunch at a table in the diner.
               beth is summing up the birthday presents she bought.
          
                                      beth
                            we've got bennett's, and grant's
                            and foley's. ha, conrad should get
                            something for my mother and father.
                            he's not supposed to get
                            something for his doctor, is he?
          
                                      calvin
                            i don't think so. i think we should
                            go see him, beth. - dr. berger.
          
               beth laughs.
          
                                        beth
                            what?
          
                                      calvin
                            i think we could all go and see him
                            together.
          
                                        beth
                            why?
          
                                      calvin
                            he thinks it's a good idea.
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    90.
          81   continued:                                                 81
          
          
                                      beth
                            ho... he thinks it's a good idea?
                            what does he know about me, about
                            this family? i've never even met
                            him.
          
                                      calvin
                            exactly. that's the point.
                            wouldn't it be easier if we all
                            talked about it? in the open.
          
                                      beth
                            about what? what are we gonna talk
                            about? don't try to change me,
                            calvin. i don't want anymore
                            changes in my life. for god's sake,
                            hasn't enough happened? let's just
                            hold on to what we've got!
          
                                      calvin
                            darling, that is what this is for.
                            maybe you'll get a surprise.
          
                                       beth
                            i don't want any surprises.
                            i know i'm not perfect. and if i
                            can't go around hugging everybody
                            all the time the way you do, then
                            i'm sorry.
          
                                      calvin
                            i am not asking you to be perfect,
                            you're missing the point.
          
                                      beth
                            i don't want to see any doctors or
                            counselors. i am me. this is my
                            family. and if we have problems,
                            then we will solve those problems
                            in the privacy of our own home, not
                            by running to some kind of
                            specialist everytime something goes
                            wrong...
          
                                      waitress
                                (interrupting)
                            are you folks ready to order?
          
                                      calvin
                            huh, no... could you give me a
                            couple of minutes, please?
          
                                      waitress
                            sure.
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    91.

                            ...running to experts every time
                            something goes wrong.
          
               silence
          
                                      beth (cont'd)
                            i know you mean well. i want this
                            to be a nice christmas.

                            relax.
          
               calvin seems doubtfull. beth goes softly.
          
                                      beth (cont'd)
                            i have already talked to mother
                            about it, and conrad can stay with
                            them. please don't worry about it.
                            please, for his sake, don't indulge
                            him. we need time together. okay?
          
                                       calvin
                            okay.   okay.
          
               beth takes his hand but it seems almost like a handshake.
          
                                      beth
                            i love you.

                            i love you, too.
          
               beth stares at him.
          
                                      beth
                            let's just give things time. okay?
          
               calvin doesn't say anything.
