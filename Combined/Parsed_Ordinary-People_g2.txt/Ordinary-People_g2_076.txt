               jeannine stops to drink some water at the tap of the
               fountain. conrad see her when he is already too near, and
               has almost his coat on. seeing an opportunity to talk to
               her, he steps back, takes off his coat while she is not
               looking, then passes her, putting on his coat as if he was
               naturally on his way out.
