               calvin enters conrad's bedroom and closes the door. conrad is
               lying on his stomach, feeling all crooked. his voice is
               muffled by his head between his arms.
          
                                      calvin

                            why don't you tell her?
          
                                      conrad
                            oh, god, no, i can't! don't you
                            see? i can't talk to her!
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                      77.

                                       calvin
                            why not?
          
                                      conrad
                            ha! because it doesn't change
                            anything. it doesn't change the way
                            she looks at me.
          
                                      calvin
                            she was upset, conrad. your mother
                            was hurt because you quit the swim
                            team. i don't understand it myself.
          
                                      conrad
                            i don't mean just now. don't you
                            see? i don't mean just today.
          
                                      calvin
                            what then? explain it to me.
          
                                      conrad
                            ha! i can't! everything is german
                            pudding with you , dad. you don't
                            see things!
          
                                      calvin
                            what things?
          
               conrad sighs.
          
                                      calvin (cont'd)
                            what things? please, i want you to
                            tell me.
          
                                      conrad
                            that she hates me! can't you see
                            that?
          
                                      calvin
                            your mother doesn't hate you,
                            conrad?
          
                                      conrad
                            all right, all right. you're right.
                            she doesn't. please leave me alone,
                            now.
          
               silence. then calvin stands up and goes to the door.
          
                                      calvin
                            what about this dr. berger? do you
                            think he's helping you?
          
                                       conrad
                            don't blame it on burger, it's not
                            his fault!
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    78.
          76   continued:                                                 76
          
          
               calvin opens the door.
          
                                      calvin
                            i'll be downstairs if you need me.
          
               exit calvin. conrad remains lying on his back with his arm
               over his eyes.
