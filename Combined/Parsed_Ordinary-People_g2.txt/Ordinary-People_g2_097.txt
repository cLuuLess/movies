               competition. conrad is sitting on one of the top bleachers,

               pool, his friends, in swimming trunks and wet hair, watch the
               race. lazenby sees him, conrad looks down. in the audience,
               everyone is shouting for his team.

               and silent, except for someone sweeping the side of the pool,
