          44   int. jarrett's house, buck's bedroom Â­day                    44
          
               beth slowly enters buck's abandoned bedroom, all silent.
               everything has stayed like it was. beth looks around, sits on
               bed. stares at photos, prizes and objects. it's like a
               museum.
