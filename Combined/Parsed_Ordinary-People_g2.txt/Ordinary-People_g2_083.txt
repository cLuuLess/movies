                                      dr berger
                            tuesday you felt great. you bought
                            a christmas tree, it was all hunky-
                            dory. okay?
          
                                      conrad
                            you're the doctor.
          
                                      dr berger
                            don't take refuge in one-liners
                            like "you're the doctor". okay?
                            because that pisses me off.
          
                                      conrad
                            okay. okay.
          
                                      dr berger
                            so everything was fine till you had
                            the fight with your mother, then
                            everything was lousy.
          
                                      conrad
                            yeah, but i don't blame her. i
                            mean, she's got... she's got her
                            reasons. it's impossible after all
                            the shit i've pulled!
          
                                      dr berger
                            what shit have you pulled? hey!
                            remember! i'm talking proportion
                            here. now, what shit?
          
               conrad sighs.
          
                                      dr berger (cont'd)
                            come on. you must be able to come
                            up with at least one example.
                            and don't give me "i tried to
                            kill myself", that's old turkey.
                            what have you done lately?
          
                                      conrad
                            lately?
          
                                      dr berger
                            uh, uh.
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                     79.
          76   continued:                                                  76
          
          
                                      conrad
                            hey, come on, if you... listen,
                            i'm never gonna be forgiven for
                            that. never! you know, you can't
                            get it out, you know, all the blood
                            in her towels, in her rug.
                            everything had to be pitched.
                            even the tiles in the bathroom
                            had to be regrouted. christ, she
                            fired the godamn maid because she
                            couldn't dust the living room
                            right. if you think i'm gonna
                            forgive... - that she's gonna
                            forgive me...
          
               conrad stops. dr. berger looks at conrad to signal him he
               just said something: conrad realizes he just made a freudian
               slip, looks at him,
          
                                      dr berger
                            what?
          
               conrad stands up, reflects, looks outside window.
          
                                      conrad
                            i think i just figured something
                            out.
          
                                      dr berger
                            what?
          
                                      conrad
                            who it is who can't forgive who...
          
                                      dr berger
                            well a real problem... a real
                            problem has a real solution.
          
                                      conrad
                            i've heard this all before.
          
                                      dr berger
                            doesn't make it any less true.
          
                                      conrad
                            i'm so tired.
          
                                      dr berger
                            yeah, well... that's a hell of a
                            secret you've been keeping on
                            yourself.
          
                                      conrad
                            so what do i do now?
          
          
          
          
                                                                   (continued)

                                      dr berger
                            recognize her limitations.
          
                                      conrad
                            you mean, like she can't love me?
          
                                      dr berger
                            oh, kiddo, no. like she can't love
                            you enough. like don't blame her
                            for not loving you more than she's
                            able.
          
                                      conrad
                            but she loves my father. i know she
                            loved my brother. it's me!
          
                                      dr berger
                            ha! now we're back to the rotten
                            kid routine! she can't love you
                            because you're unlovable. where
                            does that leave your dad? how come
                            he loves you? you're a rottenkid,
                            doesn't he know that?
          
                                       conrad
                            that's different. he feels
                            responsible. besides, he loves
                            everybody.
          
                                      dr berger
                            ho, i get it! the guy's got no
                            taste! he loves you, but he's
                            wrong.
                            look... maybe she just can't
                            express it the way you'd like her
                            to. maybe she's just afraid to
                            show you what she feels.
          
                                      conrad
                            what do you mean?
          
                                      dr berger
                            i mean there's someone besides your
                            mother you've got to forgive.
          
                                      conrad
                            you mean me?
          
               conrad is wondering.
          
                                      conrad (cont'd)
                            for trying to off myself?
                            don't you sit there and stare at
                            me. what for?

                            why don't you give yourself a
                            break? let yourself off the hook?
          
                                      conrad
                            what did i do?

                            we'll talk about it on thursday.

                            the plug... come on! what did i do?
