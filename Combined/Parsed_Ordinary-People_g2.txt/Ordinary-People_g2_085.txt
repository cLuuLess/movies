               int. dr. berger's office Â­ evening
          
               calvin laughs nervously, all smiles.
          
                                      dr berger
                                (os)
                            that's good.
          
                                      calvin
                            in the car, i was thinking: "be
                            clear.". i suppose that's what
                            psychiatry's about. being precise
                            and clear. and honest, of course.
                            i'll level with you. i'm not a
                            great believer in psychiatry.
          
                                      dr berger
                            okay.
          
                                       calvin
                            i know what happens here is only
                            between you and him, and...i like
                            that, i respect that.
                            and...he's better, i can see
                            that. i am not trying to put you
                            down, i just don't believe in
                            psychiatry as a panacea for
                            everybody.
          
                                      dr berger
                            neither do i.
          
               calvin laughs.
          
                                      calvin
                            i wish i knew what the hell i was
                            doing here.
          
                                      dr berger
                            well, you said you... thought you
                            could shed some light on some
                            things. what did you mean by that?
          
          
          
          
                                                                 (continued)
          
                                                                      84.
          77   continued:                                                   77
          
          
                                      calvin
                            i don't know actually, i'm not
                            sure, i think i meant in terms of
                            conrad. you see, i knew something
                            was wrong even before he tried
                            to... to kill himself. but i
                            thought that... it's clear that
                            he's very smart. he's been an "a"
                            student ever since he started
                            school, and naturally i thought
                            that ...intelligent people could
                            work out their own problems.
          
                                      dr berger
                            but you still feel responsible?
          
                                      calvin
                            yeah, sure i do. it's hard not to.
                            it was luck. it was just luck
                            that i happened to be there when
                            he tried it. i could have been at
                            a meeting. we both could've been
                            away. it was luck!
          
                                       dr berger
                            you think of yourself as a lucky
                            man, then?
          
                                      calvin
                            no! no. no. i used to. i used to
                            think... that i was a lucky person...
                            before... the "accident".
                            mmm, i guess the whole of life is
                            nothing but an accident, is it?
                            what happens to you. i should do
                            with it.
          
                                      dr berger
                            that sounds more like the
                            philosophy of a drifter than a tax
                            attorney.
          
                                      calvin
                            yeah. maybe, maybe i am drifting a
                            little. i can see myself, ...and i
                            can see the two of them drifting
                            away from me, and i just stand
                            there watching.
          
                                      dr berger
                            what would you want to do about
                            that?
          
                                      calvin
                            something. i gotta do something
                            about it. i don't know what.
                                      (more)
          
                                                                    (continued)
          
                                                                    85.
          77   continued:                                                 77
                                      calvin (cont'd)
                            i feel like i'm sitting on a fence,
                            and i don't like it.
          
                                      dr berger
                            and you see them as on ...opposite
                            sides of this fence?
          
                                      calvin
                            yeah... no. i don't know. i see her
                            not being able to forgive him.
          
                                        dr berger
                            for what?
          
                                      calvin
                            oh, i don't know exactly. being too
                            much like her. people always think
                            that she and buck are... were
                            ...were alike. but it's really she
                            and conrad. they were the only two
                            that didn't cry at the funeral, you
                            know? it's not easy for me to admit
                            this but, uh... she didn't...
                            his mother doesn't show him a
                            great deal of affection. i'm not
                            trying to put her down in any way
                            at all. she is a wonderful woman,
                            huh...
          
                                      dr berger
                            did she give buck much affection to
                            ...buck?
          
                                      calvin
                            oh, god, yes, she loved buck!
                            bucky got so much... i think what
                            she felt for him was special. you
                            know, he was her first-born.
                            that's not unusual, is it?
          
                                        dr berger
                            and you?
          
                                        calvin
                            me?    i   loved buck.
          
                                       dr berger
                            what i mean is, your wife's
                            affection.
          
                                      calvin
                            for me you mean?
          
                                        dr berger
                            yes.
          
          
          
          
                                                                  (continued)

                                        calvin
                            mmm. she's very... no. there's no
                            problem with her for me. we've
                            been... we've been married nearly
                            twenty one years. everybody loves
                            beth. but, huh... for conrad, -
                            it's been difficult. he didn't talk
                            about that? we don't know what
                            happens here. it doesn't come up. i
                            guess that's what it is. it's
                            private here. isn't it?
          
                                       dr berger
                            mm-hmm.   very private.
          
                                      calvin
                            i think i know why i came here. i
                            think i came here to talk about
                            myself.
          
                                      dr berger
                            okay. why don't we?
