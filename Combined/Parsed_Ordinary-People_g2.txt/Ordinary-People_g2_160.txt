                             yeah. it was kind of a rough week.
          
                                       calvin
                             i hope your grandmother wasn't too
                             tough on you?
          
                                       conrad
                             no. she was fine. i'm glad you're
                             back.
          
                conrad gives his mother a hug, but she is like made of stone.
                calvin sees it.
          
                                       conrad (cont'd)
                             good night.
          
                beth remains transfixed as if she didn't know what it was all
                about. calvin sees it.
