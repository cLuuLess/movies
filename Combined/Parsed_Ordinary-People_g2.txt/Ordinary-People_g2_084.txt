               calvin and friend are jogging in sportswear. calvin's friend
               explains a stock market deal he made.
          
                                      friend
                            say. after going to a new high, it
                            falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies
                            on good volume. i shoot an order to
                            buy 4000 at the market. if i get
                            the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, i know
                            something's wrong.

                            but suppose the order to buy the
                            4000 shares i put in at the price
                            of 113 3/4, i get 2000 at 114, 500
                            at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way
                            up, so the last 500 shares i pay
                            115 1/2, then i know i'm right.i'm
                            going to peel off here.
          
               friend leaves calvin and runs toward his home.
          
                                      calvin
                            ok.

               voices are echoing off screen.
