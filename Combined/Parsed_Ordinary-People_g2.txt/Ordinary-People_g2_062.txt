                                      conrad

                                         dr berger

                                      conrad

                                      dr berger
                            what are you thinking?
          
                                      conrad
                            that i jack off a lot.
          
                                      dr berger
                            so what else is new? does it help?
          
                                      conrad
                            for a minute.
          
               silence
          
                                        dr berger
                            what now?
          
                                        conrad
                            john boy.
          
                                        dr berger
                            who?
          
                                      conrad
                            you know, in "the waltons". john
                            boy?
          
                                      dr berger
                            yeah. what about him?
          
                                      conrad
                            my father came into my room and he
                            didn't know what to say.
                            this is right after buck died.
                            and he came over and sat on the
                            bed next to me, put his arm
                            around my shoulder. we just sat
                            there.
                            i remember i was watching his
                            shoe.
                            and thinking...
                            cos his shoe was turned over on
                            its side.
                            i was thinking: "he's so uptight,
                            it's gonna crack off."
          
               dr berger listens carefully.
          
                                       conrad (cont'd)
                            and i knew i should have felt
                            something.
                            but i didn't know what to feel.
                            i kept thinking what they say on
                            tv, you know, stuff like:
                                       (more)
          
                                                                 (continued)
          
                                                                    53.
          56   continued:                                                 56
                                      conrad (cont'd)
                            "oh, no, noo! ooh, my god!"
                            but i didn't say that... because
                            i didn't feel sad...
                            so much as...
          
               conrad sighs.
          
                                      dr berger
                            so much as what?
          
                                       conrad
                            i dunno. i kept thinking that john
                            boy would've said something...about
                            the way he felt, you know.
                            something.
          
                                      dr berger
                            what would john boy have said?
          
                                      conrad
                            i don't know.
          
                                       dr berger
                            come on.
          
               conrad seems lost. dr berger is on to something.
          
                                       dr berger (cont'd)
                            come on.
          
                                      conrad
                            come on what?
          
                                      dr berger
                            don't hold back.
          
               silence
