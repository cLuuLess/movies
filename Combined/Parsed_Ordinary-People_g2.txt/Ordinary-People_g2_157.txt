          150   ext. jeannine's home Â­ early morning                       150
          
                jeannine opens her curtains, sees conrad, outside her home,
                walking to and fro. she puts on a jacket and comes out to
                him.
          
                                       conrad
                             hi. i was gonna call but i didn't
                             want to wake anyone.
          
                                       jeannine
                             might have been easier...
          
                                       conrad
                             listen, i want to say something
                             about the other night. i mean i
                             liked being with you but i didn't
                             like myself.
          
                                       jeannine
                             conrad. i was stupid.
                             that was dumb of me to laugh and
                             it was my fault. i just didn't
                             know what to do. i was
                             embarrassed.
          
                                        conrad
                             really?   you were embarrassed?
          
                                       jeannine
                             yes. when those boys came in, it
                             was awful and awkward. that's what
                             i do when i get embarrassed. i
                             laugh.
          
                                       conrad
                             but they were all right. they were
                             just up and they were having a good
                             time, and i let them get in the way
                             of what was happening. it was dumb.
                             it was dumb. i've been doing lots
                             of dumb things lately. i just
                             didn't know wether or not you were
                             being straight with me.
          
          
                                                                   (continued)
          
                                                                    116.
          150   continued:                                                 150
          
          
                jeannine is moved, she extends her hand to him then put it to
                her heart.
          
                                          conrad (cont'd)
                             yeah?
          
                jeannine nods.
          
                                       conrad (cont'd)
                             anyway, i'd like to try it again. i
                             thought it worked out okay. well,
                             except for the bowling.
          
                jeannine laughs, looks down, then looks up straight in his
                eyes.
          
                                          jeannine
                             yes.
          
                                          conrad
                             yes?
          
                jeannine nods.
          
                                          jeannine
                             yes.
          
                conrad is moved.
          
                                          conrad
                             uh...   are you going to school?
          
                                       jeannine
                             no, not on sunday.
          
                conrad realizes. laughs.
          
                                       jeannine (cont'd)
                             have you eaten?
          
                                       conrad
                             no. i haven't.
          
                                       jeannine
                             do you want some breakfast?
          
                conrad nods. she smiles at him.
          
                                          conrad
                             okay.
          
                they go up the steps and jeannine opens the screen door.
          
                                          jeannine
                             mom!
          
                                                                117.
