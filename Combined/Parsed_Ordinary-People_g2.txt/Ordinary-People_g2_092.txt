               jeannine is eating a hamburger.
          
          
          
                                                                 (continued)
          
                                                                    93.

                                      jeannine
                            can you ever break the ball?
          
                                      conrad
                            can't break the ball, can't break
                            the floor, can't break anything in
                            a bowling alley. and that's what i
                            like about bowling alleys. can't
                            even break the record.
          
               jeannine giggles with laughing eyes.
          
                                         conrad (cont'd)
                            anyway...
          
                                         jeannine
                            hmm? what?
          
                                      conrad
                            just "anyway", it's a conversation
                            starter.
          
                                         jeannine
                            catchy!
          
                                      conrad
                            you like it?
          
                                         jeannine
                            mmm, mmm.
          
                                      conrad
                            i thought it'd get to you. i've
                            been working on it all day.
          
               jeannine laughs, then:
          
                                      jeannine
                            do you think people are punished
                            for the things they do?
          
                                      conrad
                            you mean by god?
          
                                         jeannine
                            yeah.
          
                                      conrad
                            mmm, i don't believe in god.
          
                                      jeannine
                            not at all?
          
                                      conrad
                            no. well, it's not a question of
                            degree. either you do or you don't.
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    94.

                                      jeannine
                            i believe in god.
          
                                      conrad
                            so you're afraid he'll punish you
                            for something you did?
          
                                      jeannine
                            i've done a lot of things i'm
                            ashamed of.
          
                                      conrad
                            yeah? so have i.
          
               she looks up at him, then at his wrists.
          
                                      jeannine
                            did it hurt?
          
                                      conrad
                            no, i dunno, i don't remember
                            really.
          
                                      jeannine
                            you don't want to talk about it?
          
                                      conrad
                            ah, i don't know... i've never
                            really talked about it.
                            to doctors, but not to anyone else.
                            you're the first who's asked.
          
                                      jeannine
                            why did you do it?
          
                                      conrad
                            uh... i don't know. it was like...
                            falling into a hole.
                            it was like falling into a hole,
                            and it keeps getting bigger and
                            bigger, .and you can't get out,
                            and then, .all of a sudden, it's
                            inside...and you're the hole, and
                            you're trapped, and it's all
                            over. something like that. and
                            it's not really scary, except it
                            is when you think back on it.
                            'cause you know what you were
                            feeling stange and new...
          
               a group of noisy students enter the diner.
          
                                      students
                                (singing and horsing
                                 around)
                                      (more)
          
          
                                                                  (continued)
          
                                                                    95.
          84   continued:                                                  84
                                      students (cont'd)
                            like mcdonald's can, nobody can
                            do it. like mcdonald's can, you
                            deserve a break today. so get up
                            and get away!
          
               the manager tries to calm them down. a student comes to
               conrad's table and steals some fries.
          
                                      student
                            hey. jarrett. how you doing? how
                            about some fries?
          
               some students grab jeannine and dance around, put a mac
               donald's hat on her head. she laughs.
          
                                      jeannine
                            what are you doing?
          
               the manager pushes them towards the exit.
          
                                      student
                            hey, what's your problem? lighten
                            up!
          
                                      manager
                            hey. i don't like your attitude.
          
               going out, a student pulls the manager's ear. jeannine
               laughs, a bit stupidly. conrad notices it. she sees that.
