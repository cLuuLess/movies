              conrad is lying on his stomach, on his bed, thinking. he
              composes himself, grabs his book as if he had been reading.
          
                                     conrad
                           yeah?
          
          
                                                                (continued)
          
                                                                    7.

              calvin opens the door, but does not enter the room,
              respecting his son's privacy:
          
                                       calvin
                           you okay?
          
                                     conrad

                           how was the show?
          
              calvin shrugs, as if to say "so and so..."
          
                                     calvin
                           mmmh. trouble sleeping?
          
                                       conrad
                           no.
          
                                     calvin
                           you're sure?
          
                                       conrad
                           mm-hmm.
          
                                     calvin
                           burning the midnight oil?
          
                                       conrad
                           yeah.
          
                                       calvin
                           okay.
          
              pause
          
                                     calvin (cont'd)
                           you thought about calling that
                           doctor?
          
                                       conrad
                           no.
          
                                     calvin

                           should stick to the plan.
          
                                     conrad
                           the plan was if i needed to call
                           him.
          
                                     calvin
                           yeah. okay. don't worry about it.
                           get some sleep. by the way, i am
                           working on those michigan state
