int. apartment - day

it's dark, drawn shades. a small studio. reynaud and
grace move tactically with drawn guns. grace enters the
kitchen. light smoke.
reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under
the blankets. reynaud whips aside the blanket. just
pillows.
grace checks under the sink.
reynaud checks the bathroom and shower.
a coffee pot smokes, sizzling sludge on the bottom.
grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one
lurks in there.

                        grace

          clear.
grace turns off the burner. she crosses to a window,
whips aside the curtains, and opens it. coughing.

                         grace

          ugh.   got a lung full.

                                           (continued)





                                                        31.





continued:




grace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half-eaten
plate of food on the table.

                           grace

             looks like this guy ran out in the
             middle of breakfast.
laval has entered, he stares out the window.      grace looks
out the window, reacts.




what grace sees

the apartment window has a perfect view of the gym
parking lot where the killing occurred.







back to scene

reynaud sees that and also reacts.

                           inspector laval

             we should get out of here. don't
             touch anything.
they back out of there.
