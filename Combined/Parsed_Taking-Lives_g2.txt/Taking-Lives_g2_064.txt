int. police gym - day




five xl-sized cops pump iron before their shift.

camera finds grace.




she's doing sit-ups on a decline bench, holding a 25-
pound plate to her chest. she's a machine. sweating.
intense. the cops can't help but to be impressed.
grace's cell rings. she doesn't stop, does sit-ups
faster. at the last second she answers.

                        grace

                  (into phone, panting)

                          grace

                        inspector laval (v.o.)

          the x-rays don't match.

                        grace
