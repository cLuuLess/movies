ext. forest crash site - day

costa lays by the road.     motionless, he may be hurt bad.







unmarked #1

is now martin asher's funeral pyre. flames engulf
everything. even the glass is melting.

boom!   a tire explodes.

costa stirs, crawls on his hands and knees, into the road
away from the wreck.
pop-pop-pop!   ammunition in the unmarked explodes from
the heat.
a police car arrives.    screeches to a stop alongside
costa.
grace leaps from the passenger side. she grabs costa,
helps him into the back. pop-pop-pop! more ammo cooking

off.


                           grace

          let's go!
