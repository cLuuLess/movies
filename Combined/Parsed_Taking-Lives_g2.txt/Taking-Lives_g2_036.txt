int. medical examiner's office - day




this is his personal space, tons of hockey paraphernalia.
a couple tired easy chairs. the medical examiner eats a
slice of pizza. grace studies an evidence bag containing
a man's ring.




                        medical examiner

          fell out of his t-shirt when i
          removed the clothing. it doesn't
          fit the victim.

                         grace

                   (off the ring)
          wvss.   1995. what's that?

                        medical examiner

          west vancouver secondary school
          class of '95.

                       grace

          cwe? whose initials?   not the
          victim's.

                        medical examiner

          no. i called the school and had
          someone find them in a yearbook.
          here's the original owner's name.
          but it could have been through a
          dozen pawn shops since then.
he hands her a piece of paper.   grace has a big smile.

                        grace

          doctor, can i take you back to
          quantico with me?

                        medical examiner

          sorry. i must remain where the
          hockey is good.
grace hands the paper to reynaud.
