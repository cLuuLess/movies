int. interrogation room - night

costa has finished the sketch. he holds it up to the
mirror, for those he assumes are watching.
reflected in the two-way mirror is costa's sketch.   cold
piercing eyes, chiseled features.
the door opens, expecting grace, costa is disappointed to
see a tough-looking paramedic unwrapping a cotton swab.

                        paramedic

          please open your mouth.
