int. grace's truck - moving - night

the accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. grace
drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in
low gear. she drives around a fallen tree branch.

                           radio announcer (v.o.)

             the state police have said to stay
             off the road unless it's an
             absolute emergency. several of
             their cruisers have already been
             damaged. there is ice everywhere.
             on the way in tonight i saw the
             snowplow slipping and sliding.
             everybody, stay where you are.
             this is only the beginning.
grace turns off the radio.     turns on the defroster.

something moving.


wham!

her windshield shatters.     grace reacts.
a tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her
truck.
the truck slides across the ice. grace fights to regain
control, to keep it out of the ditch.
grace stops.     gets out.   pulls the branch off the hood.
