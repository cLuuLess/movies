int. asher house - living room - day

mrs. asher sits on her couch. asher stands.        the teeny
doberman walks into the room, sniffs asher.

                        asher

          what happened to rex?     he was a
          real dog, right, mom?
rolls up his sleeve, revealing the dog bite scars.

                           mrs. asher

             don't show me that, martin. i had
             rex put down after you ran away.
             martin, sit.



asher looks at her defiantly.     mrs. asher stands, gets in
his face.

                           mrs. asher

             how dare you defy me. you will
             sit down on that couch and you
             will do it now. martin.
asher sits. mrs. asher lays a hand on his, leans
forward, her eyes intense and earnest.

                           mrs. asher

             martin, you have severe emotional
             problems. i know you're in a lot
             of pain. there's hope and help,
             martin. look at me, martin. i
             love you very much.

                           martin

             i know now that what you did to me
             was not love.
