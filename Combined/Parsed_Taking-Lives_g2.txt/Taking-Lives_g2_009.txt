ext. pier-side cafe - day

two beat cops eat at an outdoor table.   laid back.    the
woman approaches them, frantic.

                        woman

          i just saw my dead son get off the
          ferry.
the cops trade looks.

                         woman

          listen to me; he's been dead
          eighteen years. he just walked
          right past me.
