int. director gillet's office - day (present)




grace puts it together.

                        grace

          let me guess, costa was selling
          stolen art for hart and never gave
          him the money. now hart is just
          another one of asher's victims.
director gillet.

                        director gillet

          costa owed him eight thousand.
          those are e-mails off hart's
          computer.

                        grace

                  (reading)
          go to hell. i won't pay you a
          dime. i'm not scared of you.




flashback - int. internet cafe - night

richard hart checks his e-mail and nearly has a heart
attack.

                        grace (v.o.)

          come and get me. i will never pay
          you, dumbass.
                  (thinks a beat)
          asher taunted hart into a
          confrontation. jesus. it was
          right there in my face. i was
          interpreting behavior from two
          different suspects.







back to scene (present)


                        director gillet

          he had us all fooled, grace. all
          of us. if asher can do that, what
          else can he do?

                        grace

          anything he wants.
knocking. gillet stands, crosses, opens his door. two
fbi supervisors enter. grim, silver-haired. grace
stands.

                         grace

          ah, the undertakers have arrived
          for my career.
