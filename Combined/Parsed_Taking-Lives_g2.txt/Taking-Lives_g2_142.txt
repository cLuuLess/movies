the doctor staples costa's scalp.

                           costa

             is that going to hold?   i'm not
             coming back.
grace enters, in a serious mood.

                             costa

             what's wrong?

                           grace

             that was my boss. i'm going back
             to quantico tomorrow.
suddenly that seems like the end of the world.       costa
looks at her.

                                                (continued)

                           costa

             washington, dc has some of the
             best art in the world. georgetown
             would be a great place to open a
             gallery.
grace realizes what he's saying.     smiles.

                           grace

             staple his mouth too, doc.
grace's cell rings.     she exits to take the call.
