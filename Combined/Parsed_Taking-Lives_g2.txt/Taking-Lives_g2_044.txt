             someone died last night because the
             asshole we're after isn't in custody.
             it's happened to me before and i'm
             sure it will happen again. it's a
             pretty miserable feeling.

                           director gillet

             i haven't felt it in a long time.
                     (a beat)
             dinner?

                           grace

             thank you. i promised the boys
             i'd hang out tonight. i'm sorry.
