ext. old private road - night

grace emerges from the woods. running along the icy
road. she slips and falls. cuts her hand on the ice.
grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
knife getting slippery.




on asher

gaining on her. grace slips again, scrabbling on the
ice, trying to keep moving. a slow motion nightmare.
here comes asher.   no mercy.   he aims the gun at her
face...

                                             (continued)





                                                           114.





continued:




grace raises her hands to protect her face...
pop! asher fires. ding! the bullet intended for
grace's forehead hits the knife -- ricochets into the
trees.
a beat.   grace looking at the now-creased knife.
asher's gun is out of rounds.     the slide is locked back
on an empty chamber.
swick! grace slices asher's legs with the knife.          slices
each shin deeply.

                          asher

             shit!
asher kicks the knife from her hand. then kicks her in
the face. he tries to kick her again but she grabs his
leg.
wham! asher slips, hits the ice hard. grace is on top
of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. wraps her
legs around his body.
grace chokes asher for all he's worth. his eyes bulge,
his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his
victims. asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted
brain dies.
grace doesn't let go. a long death embrace. finally,
when she is sure, grace releases from martin asher's
body.
she checks his pulse.    he's dead.    grace stands.
the rain falling on her. ice and moonlight. grace spits
blood, looks around. looks at asher's corpse.

                           grace

             better you than me, asshole.
walks back toward the house.      alone.   strong.   whole.
