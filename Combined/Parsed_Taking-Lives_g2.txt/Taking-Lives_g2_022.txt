int. task force room - day

grace, reynaud and laval look through a haystack of
computer printouts for needles of information. grace
stretches. grabs a donut from a box. offers the box to
laval.

                           grace

             fruit of the gods. you know you
             want one.
laval gives in, takes a plain cake. she offers donuts to
reynaud. he rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly
to laval:

                           inspector reynaud

                     (subtitled french)
             let's take her down the street. i
             will not eat one of those hockey
             pucks.

                           inspector laval

             let's go down the street. very
             good food. we are inviting you.
             please.
grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports.
