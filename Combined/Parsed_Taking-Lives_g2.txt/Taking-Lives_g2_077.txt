costa, grace, laval and reynaud. costa stands there
looking at asher's image on the video monitor.

                           inspector laval

             is that the man you saw choking
             mr. ford?
fear flashes across costa's face.

                           costa

             i must of walked right past him.

                           grace

             mr. costa, is that the man you saw
             kill mr. ford in the parking lot?

                           costa

             yes. that's him. that is the man
             i saw murder todd ford in the
             parking lot outside my gym. no
             doubt. now will you go catch him,
             please?

                            grace

             thank you.   i just needed you to
             say it.

                           costa

             who is this guy? he's like a
             ninja. sneaking into my office.
             how dangerous is he? does he want
             to kill me?

                           grace

             john, no harm will come to you.
             listen to me. no harm will come
             to you. i promise. anyone who
             wants to hurt you will have to get
             through these two for starters.

                                              (continued)

continued:




she gestures at laval and reynaud.     costa turns to them.

                           costa

             how many people have you killed?



reynaud shrugs.

                           inspector laval

             you will be safe, my friend.

                           grace

             we want you to be there tonight.
a beat, costa smiles.     realizes she's serious.

                           costa

             no. i'm not meeting him.
             absolutely not. you ever go
             fishing? the bait always dies.

                           grace

             he won't get within fifty feet of
             you. the second we see him, the
             cuffs go on.

                           costa

                     (adamant)
             grace, no.
