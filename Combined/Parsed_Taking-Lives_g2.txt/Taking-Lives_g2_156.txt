ext. asher house - day

reynaud's car slides to a stop. police cars take
position around the block, forming a perimeter around the
house.
grace and reynaud exit the car. grace has a shotgun.
four uniforms, also with shotguns, join them.
the ad hoc entry team runs up the steps, onto the porch.

                           grace

             get right, i got left.
wham!   reynaud kicks the door.      grace is first in.
