ext. highway - day

the middle of nowhere.    martin flips a coin.    heads.

                          dan

          shit.
dan hauls the spare from the trunk.      sets the jack under
the bumper.
a pickup truck approaches.      still a mile away.
martin watches dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.
the pickup gets closer, a big one.      heavy with bags of
animal feed. speeding.
martin looking at dan's back. martin shoves dan hard,
into the highway. in front of:







the grill of the pickup

wham! it plasters dan. he goes over the hood, shatters
the front windshield. bounces off, spins like a rag doll
into a ditch.
the pickup has lost control, it rolls.      several times, a
heaving mass of steel.
crash! the truck folds itself around a husky tree.         no
survivors, that's clear.




martin

he can't believe what he has just done.       he takes in the
carnage, tugs at his ear.
