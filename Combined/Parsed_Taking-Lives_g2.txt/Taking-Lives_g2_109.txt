int. unmarked car - moving - late night

grace drives.     costa in the passenger seat.

                           costa

             the night started out great.
             everything gelled. everyone was
             happy. you helped land a big fish
             and the feeding frenzy started.
             six figure pieces were flying off
             the wall.
                     (shivers)
             he said he was going to blow out
             my spine. i was thinking surgery.
             six months in bed. exercise
             pools. never walking again.
grace looks at him.     costa is worried.

                                              (continued)





                                                       72.

                           costa

             he was in my bathroom and none of
             you could stop him. i need to
             leave town.




                           grace

             that might be a good idea. until
             then i'll check under your bed for
             monsters.
costa looks at her.     grace gives him a warm, open stare.

                           costa

             i would appreciate that very much.
                     (a beat)
             can i profile you? i read your
             book.

                           grace

             please, don't.

                           costa

             thirty-something, single white
             female. best schools best grades.
             discovers adrenaline policing the
             inner city.

                           grace

                     (cuts in)
             john, stop it. please. let's
             shift the conversation from me and
             my business onto something
             inbounds.

                           costa

             okay. are you going to my funeral
             when martin asher cuts my throat?
they both know she's been lowballing the threat. we can
tell grace is truly concerned for costa's welfare.

                           costa

             you let him get away.
grace takes that hard.

                            grace

             no excuses.   i'm sorry.

                           costa

             i meant you in the general sense.
                     (a beat)
             can you catch him?

                                              (continued)





                                                         73.





continued:





                           grace

             we got his name. we catch
             everyone sooner or later.




                           costa

             sooner, please.
