int. art gallery - night

grace enters. costa sees her, reacts, genuinely glad to
see her. and that throws grace a beat. she really likes
his smile.

                           grace

          mr. costa.

                           costa

          you caught me.

                           grace

          not yet.
grace looks over the art.

                        costa

          toussant jean bernard. i met him
          in haiti last year. very troubled
          life. outlived all his children.
          and he had ten. he lost his wife
          to cancer and went blind. passed
          away last year.

                        grace

          overpriced folk art. is it the
          work of a soul that has suffered?
          sure. are his explorations as an
          artist groundbreaking? no.

                        costa

          ouch. and i was going to send you
          two and charge them to your amex.

                        grace

          i couldn't afford it.
costa is looking at her, looking through her.

                        costa

          what about daddy's amex? i've
          sold quite a bit of art to poor
          little rich girls like you.

grace grows tense.

                             grace

             excuse me.




                             costa

             try the wine.

                           grace

             i'm partial to beer. and i don't
             have long. i came by to thank you
             for your help. and i apologize if
             you were detained. you did the
             right thing. trying to save him.

                           costa

             why, thank you. agent vanderholt.
                     (gives her a card)
             i'm having a show friday. you
             should come by and meet some good
             people.

                            grace

             who knows.   where'd you learn cpr?

                           costa

             medical school. before i dropped
             out. i had a moment of clarity:
             in anatomy class i realized i'd
             rather draw bodies than cut them
             up. and when i realized i couldn't
             make art, i decided to sell it.

                             grace

             some journey.

                           costa

             it's taken me all over the world.

                           grace

             about monday again, did you see
             mr. ford fighting back?

                           costa

             at first i thought i was
             interrupting something, you know?

                             grace

             no, i don't.

                           costa

             i thought they were hugging. then
             the gun came out when he saw me.

                                               (continued)

continued:





                           grace

             i guess that's it. thanks.

                            grace

             if you remember any details or
             need anything.
                     (off his look)
             anything related to the case,
             please call me.

                            costa

             okay. think about friday.
