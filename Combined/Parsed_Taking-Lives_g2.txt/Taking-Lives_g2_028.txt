int. inspector's offices - night

grace doesn't like the turn.

                           grace

             you need to confirm he's a suspect
             or clear him and kick-start a
             manhunt based on costa's id. if
             he is a legit witness, he'll get
             heated up and start forgetting
             details. i think there's a way to
             clear him without pissing him off.
             may i?

                           director gillet

             please.

                                                (continued)





                                                          23.





continued:




grace knocks on the interview room door.

                            grace

             inspector.   i need a moment with
             you.
laval exits the room, shutting the door behind them. a
rookie hands director gillet a cup of coffee and a new
dress shirt wrapped in plastic.

                           inspector laval

             i was getting into his mind.

                           grace

             i have a shortcut. can you get
             any of his school transcripts?

                            inspector laval

             sure.   it's all on-line.
grace takes an evidence bag containing the garrote from
the latest crime scene. she drops it in her computer
bag.
grabs a case file.

                            grace

             call the winnipeg police and have
             them fax or e-mail his driver's
             license photo.
grace crosses, opens the door, enters.
