int. autopsy room - day

gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. the
medical examiner places the skull on an exam table and
begins cleaning it.
grace walks around the headless body. the wetsuit has
been removed, the body has been autopsied. headless,
skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved.
director gillet is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar.    he's a
cop's cop and all-around nice guy.

                        director gillet

          i can't tell you how excited we
          are to have you here.

                         grace

          you only have one victim. usually
          there's two or three by the time i
          get called in.

                        director gillet

          this case made page one of the
          globe. the tabloids say there is
          a headhunter on the loose.

             the mayor wants closure. that's
             his vacation house they were
             building. i get calls from
             supervisors i didn't know i had.

                           grace

             you clear the mayor?

                           director gillet

             we cleared the mayor. he read the
             article on you in newsweek and
             insisted we fly you up. the
             papers say two campers had a
             drunken fight and the loser lost
             his head.

                           grace

             what do you think?

                           director gillet

             i don't solve crimes anymore, i
             balance budgets.

                           grace

             this was not a heat of the moment
             killing. and the victim was
             buried complete with head. the
             grave was five-foot ten. the
             victim's height. with square
             corners. dug with a shovel the
             killer had the foresight to bring.

                           director gillet

             thirty-five detectives searched
             the area saturday. my
             investigators think you're a
             witch.

                           grace

             i've been called worse.
the medical examiner finds two small holes in the skull,
waves the photographer over.

                           director gillet

             jeez. look at that, looks like he
             got ice-picked.
she simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on
the skull.

                           grace

             no. a large canine did that.
             probably an old or sick timber
             wolf that couldn't hunt. it dug
             up the body and chewed off the
             head. it felt safe in the trees,
             away from the riverbank, away from
             the other wolves.
the medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.

                           medical examiner

             i'd say you're right.
                     (into tape recorder)
             postmortem scavenger damage to c-1.
the medical examiner examines the skull's teeth.

                           medical examiner

             the victim was afraid of dentists.
             bad teeth.
inspectors laval and reynaud enter. both give grace wary
nods. inspector laval hands the medical examiner a paper
bag marked human remains.

                            inspector laval

             this was a meter from the skull.
             at soil level.
the medical examiner opens the bag. removes a wig. no,
not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp.
tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied
to two pieces of broomstick. the photographer snaps some
shots.
the medical examiner gingerly untangles the cord.

                             medical examiner

             look at this.
grace crosses, grins.      grace studies the cord, noting the
intricate knots.

                            grace

             bingo.   that's your murder weapon.

                           inspector laval

             it might be trash a camper left.

                                                (continued)





                                                          13.





continued:





                           grace

             no. look at it, braided parachute
             cord, two pieces of broom stick.
             you approach the victim from
             behind, loop it around his head
             and hold on for all your might.
             the more the victim struggles, the
             quicker he passes out. and now
             you have convenient handles to
             drag around two hundred pounds of
             dead kayaker.

                           inspector laval

             that is a theory.

                           grace

             that's exactly what it is. a
             theory. that evidence supports.
             when the suspect is in custody you
             can ask him yourself what happened
             and you won't need me. inspector.
laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages.
gillet looks at grace, at the cord. turns to her
quietly.

                           director gillet

             laval and reynaud are my stars.
             very smart, very persistent
             investigators. on the street;
             they're magnificent.

                           grace

             i can see that director.   you're
             lucky to have them.
a beat.

                           grace

             go ahead, director, say what you
             have to say.

                           director gillet

             you're the expert. if you have
             any suggestions on how to
             proceed...

                           grace

             sure. a forensic anthropologist
             can draw the victim's face based
             on the skull. i know someone at
             quantico who can do it by
             tomorrow.

                                                 (continued)





                                                          14.





continued:





                           director gillet

             we have people.

                           grace

             call 'em. then show the results
             to everybody around who was
             selling outdoor goods two years
             ago. you have his initials; mrc,
             inside the wetsuit. the long hair
             is distinctive, someone may
             recognize him. it's a semi-long
             shot.

                           director gillet

             no, that's bread and butter
             detective work. thank you.
                     (checks his watch)
             we should get upstairs.
they cross to the exit. director gillet barks orders in
french at his two-star inspectors.
