int. old farmhouse - kitchen - night

grace takes a glock from her pocket and sets it on the
counter. she pours water into a kettle.

continued:




puts the kettle on the stove. turns on the stove.         grace
notices water on the kitchen floor. wait. wet
footprints.



grace reacts.     reaches for the glock.
a hand lands on top of her hand.      it's martin asher.

                             asher

             hi, grace.
click!   he snaps a handcuff around grace's wrist.
asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down
into a chair. she throws a punch. asher blocks it.
asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       smack!   grace slaps him.
asher pulls her into a chair. click! grace is now
cuffed to the chair. she struggles futilely against the
cuffs.
asher catches his breath.

                             asher

             knock it off.    you're not going
             anywhere.
grace stop struggling.       asher looking at her huge belly.

                           asher

             i'm not going to hurt you.

                           grace

             you're so full of shit your eyes
             turned brown.
asher is happy to see her.

                           asher

             they're contacts. you're glowing.
grace looking at him. still astonished to see him.         her
arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable.

                           grace

             how the fuck did you find me?

                           asher

             you told me everything i had to
             know.

                                                 (continued)





                                                         111.





continued:





                           grace

             get it over with. just get it
             over with.




                           asher

             ever since i met you, you're all i
             can think about. i had a way of
             life. and i can't go back to
             because of you. i want you in my
             life, grace. please listen to me,
             grace. i have a proposal.
asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's
licenses.

                           asher

             you become her. i become him.    we
             are married, see?
asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table.
already inscribed.

                           asher

             we have the babies. we raise
             them. however you want. i just
             want to be with you.
grace looking at asher, not sure whether to laugh out
loud or start crying. he seems edgy; he needs her
decision quick.

                           grace

             what happens if i don't want to
             assume this woman's identity and
             raise my babies with a serial
             killer?

                           asher

             grace, don't be morbid. if anyone
             can deal with this, you can. i
             know you felt what i felt. it's
             real.

                           grace

             answer my question.

                           asher

             i'll shoot you in the head and
             burn this place down.
grace reacts. she can respect that. grace looking at
asher. he's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.

                                                (continued)





                                                         112.





continued:





                           grace

             you'll do what you have to do. i
             can respect that. how do you know
             it's still real? maybe it's gone.
             what we felt.
grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. asher leans
over to kiss her. slow, delicate. asher kneels beside
her, the kisses become hungry, desperate.
grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.

                           grace

             god, i missed you so much.
asher leans in to kiss her...
grace head-butts him.    crunch!   smashes his nose.
she drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest.
asher, already on his knees, falls back.
grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair.       she
shoulders over the kitchen table...
there is a holster mounted underneath the table.
grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it.
grace reacts.     there is no gun in the holster.
asher looking at her, matter of fact:

                           asher

             i searched everything.
asher stands, reaches for the glock on the counter.
grace can't let him get it. she lunges at asher,
collides into his knees, hurting him.

                          asher

             damn you!
asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block.
thwack!   plunges it into grace's belly.
grace gasps, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach.
a beat as grace and asher stare at the knife.
grace uses the pause to kick away from asher.       she gets
on her feet and runs from the kitchen.




                                                     113.
