ext. forest construction site - night

grace vanderholt lies in the grave where the body was
discovered. it has been excavated by criminologists, the
soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. grace sits up.
grace holds out her fbi creds, shielding her eyes from
the bright light.

                           grace

             it's okay, i'm supposed to be
             here.
click.     the light goes off.   revealing laval and reynaud.

                           inspector laval

             agent vanderholt, we requested
             your help. i'm inspector laval,
             this is inspector reynaud.

                           grace

             hi. look, i'm not ready to talk
             to you guys yet. i need a little
             more time here.
reynaud and laval trade looks, walk toward two uniforms
guarding the site.

                                                 (continued)





                                                         9.





continued:




grace lays back down. sighs. concentrates on the
sounds. the river. wind in the trees. then: laughter

(o.s.).





                           grace

             would you mind trading one liners
             somewhere else? i need to hear
             the natural sounds. i appreciate
             it.
the policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    laval
gestures for them to walk down the road.




on grace

she steps out of the grave. sits by it. writes some
notes. everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.
grace takes it in for a beat.
then:   howling, the lonely song of a distant wolf.
grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.
used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. grace
sits by the fire pit.
more howling, closer this time.
grace looks down river, sees the glowing eyes of a timber
wolf staring from a clump of trees. the animal stares a
beat, then runs off. grace has the chills.
grace walks quietly toward the trees. grace just a few
feet away. rustling. she cautiously moves aside a
sapling.
