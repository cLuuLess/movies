ext. ferry pier - day

the signs in french. crowded with passengers waiting to
board. as more passengers pour off the just-docked ship.
a woman runs through the crowd. terror etched in her
face. she knocks aside several people. runs toward a
row of restaurants. even in her turmoil, she is
patrician, elegant.
