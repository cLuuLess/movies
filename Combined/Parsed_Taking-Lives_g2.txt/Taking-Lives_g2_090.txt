int. art gallery - night (9:39 pm)

a cutting edge club feel. a dj spins a captivating
mellow mix. the gallery is filled patrons abuzz with
chit-chat. inspector laval and reynaud study the
patrons.

                           inspector laval

                     (subtitled french)
             this painting costs more than my
             house.
reynaud shakes his head.




find grace

she's stunning and shy about it. she examines a
painting. a gentle hand touches her back. she turns.
it's costa. he hands her a highball.

                             grace

             thanks.

                           costa

             you look a little anxious.

                            grace

                     (re: her dress)
             this isn't me.

                                                (continued)





                                                         63.





continued:





                             costa

             it's all you.
grace gives costa a look.       she sips her drink, nods at
the painting.

                           grace

             i'm trying to get into the show,
             but i mean. what is this? it
             looks like somebody napalmed the
             garden of eden.

                            costa

             mangos.   ripe mangos hanging on a
             branch.
now she sees it.

                           grace

             oh. okay. why the borders?
             almost every painting has one.
             was he in prison or something?
costa reacts, impressed by grace.

                           costa

             most people don't notice. this is
             from his prison series. he could
             see a mango grove through his cell
             window. he made some of the
             pigments himself. from flowers.
             from his own blood.

                           grace

             what was his crime?

                           costa

             he attacked his neighbor with a
             machete. there was a woman
             involved.

                             grace

             always is.
grace sips her drink, letting herself relax.       she enjoys
costa's company.

                           grace

             he had a lot of lovers, didn't he?

                           costa

             dozens. he was a consumer of
             life's pleasures.

                                                (continued)





                                                         64.





continued:





                           grace

             now he's dead and you get rich?

                           costa

             his children formed a corporation,
             i take ten percent. i'm not a
             buccaneer, grace.
grace looks at costa and smiles.

                             costa

             what?

                           grace

             i don't think i've ever met anyone
             quite like you.

                           costa

             you're very sensitive for...

                             grace

             an fbi agent?
the elegant woman spots costa and crosses. she lays a
hand on costa's shoulder. he turns and they kiss cheeks.

                           elegant woman

             john, it's amazing tonight. i
             want to cry, i'm so touched.
grace watches her hand linger on costa's arm. and is
amazed that she feels jealous. she catches costa's eye.

                           grace

             mr. costa, i would like to discuss
             an arrangement for the series.
the elegant woman reacts.

                           elegant woman

             just a sec, john.
she crosses to the older man in b.g.       costa is miffed.

                           costa

             what are you doing?

                           grace

             she's not writing the checks.
the elegant woman returns with the older man.       he grabs
costa's hand.

                                                (continued)





                                                          65.





continued:





                           older man

             john, it's incredible what you've
             put together.
                     (aside to costa)
             the thing we were talking about
             the other day, well i'd like to
             proceed. hell, i'm sick of making
             two percent in the market.

                           costa

             dick, they're yours.
the older man smiles, shakes costa's hand. the elegant
woman looking at grace, arms crossed, enjoys her victory.
grace plays along, stalks off, hiding a grin.
