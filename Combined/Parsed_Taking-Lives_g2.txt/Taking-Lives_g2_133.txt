ext. forest crash site - day

crime scene tape. policemen form a perimeter. the fire
is out. a fire truck pumps water for a three-man hose
team cooling the hot metal. a plume of steam rises up
the scorched tree trunk.
the car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal.
asher has been reduced to a charred torso.
