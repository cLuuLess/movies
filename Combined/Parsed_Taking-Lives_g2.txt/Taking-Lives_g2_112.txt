int. unmarked #2 - day

reynaud behind the wheel, turns to grace.

                          inspector reynaud

            you spent a lot of time with
            costa.
grace isn't sure if that's an accusation.

                           inspector reynaud

            i like him.   he's a good guy.
grace smiles.
