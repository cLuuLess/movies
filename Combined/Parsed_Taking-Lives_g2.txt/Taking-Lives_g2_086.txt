int. police building lobby - news video - day

director gillet stands tall before a podium. blinded by
lights. a bouquet of microphones in his face. beside
him is a haunting poster-sized portrait of martin asher.

                           director gillet

             mr. asher, we know who you really
             are. we will find you and we will
             arrest you. you can hide no
             longer.
