int. fbi conference room - night

grace is exhausted, but holding up well.     the questions
don't stop.

                           senior agent

             agent vanderholt. why would asher
             kill ford, if nobody knew he was
             costa. if he wasn't going to use
             ford's identity?

                           grace

             he needed a murder he could link
             not only richard hart to but also
             to his past victims.




flashback - int. hart's apartment - day

upscale euro-hip. hart slams down the phone.        shoves a
gun in his belt and exits.

                           grace (v.o.)

             hart's behavior was consistent
             with a disorganized drug addict
             following the rules of the
             criminal road by attempting to
             kill a debtor who won't pay. he
             had no idea he was being
             manipulated by a serial killer.
