int. les frers - night (2:03 am)

costa looks miserable. overheating, anxiously nursing
his water. he looks around. then reacts. a note sits
on the bar top. right in front of him. costa looks
around. only sees strange faces.
costa carefully unfolds the note.       it reads:   "meet me in

the restroom now."
