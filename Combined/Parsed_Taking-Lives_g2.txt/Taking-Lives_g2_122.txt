ext. two lane highway - day

grace's car spins off the road. stops in a ditch.       a
beat. the buick's hulk blocking the road.
grace exits the unmarked. dazed but unhurt. she crosses
to the buick. three high school girls are in the car.

                         grace

           is everyone okay?
they seem alright.

                          girl #1

                                               (continued)

a police car screeches to a stop. then another police
car. grace runs to one of the police cars.

                           grace

                     (points up the road)
             he just shot a cop.
grace jumps in the passenger seat.        the cop looking at
her.

                            grace

             let's go.   bad guy's that way.
the cop nods, punches it.
