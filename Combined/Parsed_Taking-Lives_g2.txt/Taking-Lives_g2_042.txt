int. apartment - day (an hour later)

grace watches a criminalist bag a comb from the medicine
cabinet. a couple hairs entwined in its teeth.
in the kitchen another criminalist dusts for prints.
reynaud taking pictures with a large still camera. laval
knocks on the walls.
laval moves a picture frame. a photograph falls out.
laval picks it up with surgical gloves.
insert photo: a dead ringer for costa's sketch,
carousing in a thai bar.
laval shows grace.

                            grace

             resembles the man costa sketched.

             have you released him? you don't
             want your star witness steaming in
             a holding cell.

                           inspector laval

             he went home twenty minutes ago.
             agent grace, where do you think
             monsieur edwards is?




                           grace

             i bet monsieur edwards is in a
             deep grave with square corners
             like messieurs kohler and ford.
             which looks like all the victims.
             maybe he's subconsciously killing
             himself.
grace finds a guitar case. opens it. it's a mobile
office; it has postage stamps. postcards. assorted
stationery, different address labels. neat, organized.
holiday cards. a cd titled: "learn flamenco guitar."
hundreds of practice signatures. forged documents.
victim's personal effects.

                           inspector laval

             we'll take that with us.
                     (in french)
             put a number and seal on that case.
reynaud snaps pictures of the guitar case.
grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can
tell her. bonding with the space. she smells a pillow.

                           grace

             ever see a hermit crab?

                           inspector laval

             no.

                           grace

             it's a crab that lives in the
             shells of dead sea snails.

                           inspector laval

             yes, yes. they have one big claw
             and curl up tight.
laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his
jacket. begins prying off a door molding. grace sits at
the kitchen table.

                           grace

             when they outgrow an old shell,
             they search for a new empty shell,
             crawl up to it and quickly switch.

             they live in these beautiful
             shells because they have these
             soft ugly bodies. they couldn't
             survive without the shells.
             neither can the guy we're after.
laval exposes several mini dv and micro-cassettes hidden
under the molding.
