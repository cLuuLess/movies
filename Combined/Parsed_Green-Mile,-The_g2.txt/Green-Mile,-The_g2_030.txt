              int. e block - day

              ...while toot-toot takes bitterbuck's place in the cell. he's
              a wiry and toothless old trusty, crazy as a tick. he sits:

                                  toot
                        sittin' down, sittin' down,
                        rehearsing now! everybody settle!

              he glances to paul--okay, hit it.

                                  paul
                        arlen bitterbuck, step forward.

              toot springs to his feet and steps from the cell.

                                  toot
                        i'm steppin' forward, i'm steppin'
                        forward, i'm steppin' forward...

              toot turns, shows the top of his head to dean.

                                  paul
                        is his head properly shaved?

                                  dean
                        no, it's dandruffy and it smells.

                                  paul
                        i'll take that for a yes. all
                        right, arlen, let's go.

              toot starts up the corridor, ringed by guards.

                                  toot
                        i'm walkin' the mile, i'm walkin'
                        the mile, i'm walkin' the mile...

              paul's inner office

              toot throws himself to his knees as soon as they enter:

                                  toot
                        i'm prayin', i'm prayin', i'm
                        prayin'. the lord is my shepherd,
                        so on an' so forth...

                                  paul
                        toot, you have to wait till i tell
                        you to pray.
                               (toot waits)
                        okay, pray.

                                  toot
                        still prayin', still prayin'...

                                  harry
                        paul, we're not gonna have some
                        cherokee medicine man in here
                        whoopin' and hollerin' and shaking
                        his dick, are we?

                                  paul
                        well, actually--

                                  toot
                        still prayin', prayin', gettin'
                        right with jesus...

                                  harry
                        do it quietly, you old gink!

              harry slaps toot upside the head to shut him up.

                                  paul
                        as i was saying, i don't believe
                        they actually shake their dicks,
                        harry. be that as it may, mr.
                        bitterbuck is a christian, so we
                        got reverend schuster coming in.

                                  dean
                        oh, he's good. fast, too. doesn't
                        get 'em worked up.

                                  paul
                        on your feet, toot. you've prayed
                        enough for one day.

                                  toot
                        gettin' to my feet, walkin' again,
                        walkin' on the green mile...

              execution chamber

              they enter. brutal is waiting for them, gun drawn. percy
              peers out from behind the partition wall from the switch room.

                                  percy
                        what do i do?

                                  paul
                        watch and learn.

              paul motions percy behind the wall. percy sighs, takes his
              spot next to jack van hay, peers through the wire mesh as
              toot plops into old sparky, wriggling his skinny ass to get
              comfy.

                                  toot
                        sittin' down, sittin' down, takin'
                        a seat in old sparky's lap...

              paul and dean kneel to apply the ankle clamps. brutal steps
              in from the side, pressing down on the condemned man's left
              arm to keep him in place until the ankle clamps are secure.
              harry moves in from the other side, securing the right arm
              clamp.

                                  toot
                        gettin' clamped, gettin' clamped,
                        gettin'--ow, shit, watch the skin!

              paul signals "ankles secure." brutal holsters his pistol,
              applies the final clamp to the left arm.

                                  brutal
                        roll on one.

              behind the partition

              van hay mimes turning the generator knob up, whispering:

                                  van hay
                        "roll on one" means i turn the
                        generator up full. you'll see the
                        lights go brighter in half the
                        prison...

              resume main chamber

              as brutal steps before the "condemned" and pronounces:

                                  brutal
                        arlen bitterbuck, you have been
                        condemned to die by a jury of your
                        peers, sentence imposed by a judge
                        in good standing in this state.

                        do you have anything to say before
                        the sentence is carried out?

                                  toot
                               (gleefully)
                        yeah! i want a fried chicken
                        dinner with gravy on the taters,
                        i want to shit in your hat, and i
                        got to have mae west sit on my
                        face, because i am one horny
                        motherfucker!

              brutal tries to hold on, but it's impossible--he cracks up.
              everybody falls apart, howling helplessly with laughter. even
              jack van hay is guffawing behind his partition.

              only paul is reining it in--he's a little too pissed to go
              with it. he waits until the laughing fit starts to pass, then:

                                  paul
                        shut up, brutal. that goes for
                        everybody. i want quiet in here.
                               (turns)
                        toot, another remark like that,
                        i'll have van hay roll on two for
                        real.

                                  brutal
                               (beat, gently)
                        it was pretty funny.

                                  paul
                        that's why i don't like it.
                        tomorrow night we're doing this
                        for real. i don't want somebody
                        remembering a stupid joke like
                        that and getting going again.
                               (off their looks)
                        ever try not laughing in church
                        once something funny gets stuck in
                        your head. same goddamn thing.

                                  brutal
                        sorry, paul. you're right. let's
                        keep going. harry...

              harry takes a black mask and snugs it down over toot's head,
              leaving only the crown of his head exposed. brutal takes a
              large sponge, dips it in a steel bucket, mimes soaking it...

              behind the partition

                                  percy
                        what's with the sponge?

                                  van hay
                        you soak it in brine, get it good
                        and wet. conducts the electricity
                        directly to the brain, fast like
                        a bullet. you don't ever want to
                        throw the switch on a man without
                        that.

              resume main chamber

              as the sponge is placed atop toot's head. harry now lowers
              the steel cap and brutal secures the straps.

                                  brutal
                        arlen bitterbuck, electricity
                        shall now be passed through your
                        body until you are dead, in
                        accordance with the state law. god
                        have mercy on your soul.
                               (to van hay)
                        roll on two.

              behind the partition

              van hay mimes flipping the switch, looks to percy:

                                  van hay
                        and that's that.

              resume main chamber

              toot can't resist--he starts bucking and flailing:

                                  toot
                        now i'm fryin'! fryin'! geeaaah!
                        fryin' like a done tom turkey!

              paul rolls his eyes at brutal. brutal shifts his gaze past
              him and nods--look behind you.

                                  brutal
                        one of the witnesses showed up a
                        day early.

              paul turns. sitting on the door sill, watching them with
              beady eyes, is the mouse. paul turns back, addresses the room:

                                  paul
                        all right, let's go again and do
                        it right this time! get that idiot
                        out of the chair...

              high wide angle of execution chamber

              brutal and harry start undoing toot's clamps. everybody
              relaxes, drifting from their positions...

                                                       dissolve to:

              same angle as above - next night

              ...and the room is now quietly filling up with witnesses
              trickling in. people speak in whispers, if at all.
