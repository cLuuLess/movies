              ext. field - day (flashback)

              the men reload their weapons. everybody's terrified. mcgee
              starts off, the other following his lead toward--

              the river

              --where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to
              the source of that inhuman howling...

              ...and they stop, gazing in horror:

              john coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his
              huge feet splayed out before him. he's making that inhuman
              howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing
              occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air.

              curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of
              detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now
              matted to their heads with blood.

              a tableau. the men staring. john coffey howling. a train
              puffing smoke across the landscape.

              klaus detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank
              in a headlong rush. the others try to grab him, but he shrugs
              them off and throws himself on coffey with a scream of
              inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. coffey
              barely seems to notice.

              the others catch up with klaus, drag him off. he falls to his
              knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. howie runs to
              him, throws himself into his father's arm. they hug each
              other tightly, overwhelmed with grief.

              a semblance of quiet descends, except for coffey's
              heartbroken wailing. a ring of rifle toting men forms around
              him, though he hardly seems aware of it. mcgee steps forward,
              uncertain:

                                  mcgee
                        mister.

              coffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears.

                                  mcgee
                        mister? can you hear me?
                               (coffey nods)
                        you have a name?

                                  coffey
                        john coffey. like the drink, only
                        not spelt the same.

              mcgee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves.

                                  mcgee
                        what happened here, john coffey?
                        you want to tell me that?

                                  coffey
                        i couldn't help it. i tried to
                        take it back, but it was too late.

                                  mcgee
                               (pause)
                        boy, you are under arrest for
                        murder.

              mcgee spits in coffey's face...

              paul on bleachers

              ...as paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his
              reading to find warden hal moores standing before him.

                                  hal
                        i interrupt?

                                  paul
                        i'm just about done.

              paul stows the file as hal settles onto the bleachers.

                                  paul
                        how's that pretty gal of yours?

                                  hal
                        melinda's not so well, paul. not
                        so well at all. got laid up with
                        another headache yesterday. worst
                        one yet. she's also developed this
                        weakness in her right hand.

                                  paul
                        doctor still think it's migraines?

              hal gives a slight shake of his head.

                                  hal
                        i'll be taking her up to indianola
                        next day or so for some tests. had
                        x-rays and the like. she is scared
                        to death. truth to tell, so am i.

                                  paul
                        if it's something they can see
                        with an x-ray, maybe it's
                        something they can fix.

                                  hal
                        maybe.

              he pulls a letter, hands it to paul.

                                  hal
                        this just came in. d.o.e. on
                        bitterbuck.

              paul glances toward bitterbuck, scans the letter, nods.

                                  paul
                        you didn't come all the way down
                        here just to hand me a d.o.e.

                                  hal
                        no. i had an angry call from the
                        state capital about twenty minutes
                        ago. is it true you ordered percy
                        wetmore off the block.

                                  paul
                        it is.

                                  hal
                        i'm sure you had reason, but like
                        it or not, the wife of the
                        governor of this state has only
                        one nephew, and his name happens
                        to be percy wetmore. i need to
                        tell you how this lays out?

                                  paul
                        little percy called his aunt and
                        squealed like a schoolroom sissy.
                               (hal nods)
                        he also mention he assaulted a
                        prisoner this morning out of sheer
                        petulance? broke three fingers on
                        eduard delacroix's left hand.

                                  hal
                        i didn't hear that part. i'm sure
                        she didn't either.

                                  paul
                        the man is mean, careless, and
                        stupid. bad combination in a place
                        like this. sooner or later, he's
                        gonna get somebody hurt. or worse.

                                  hal
                        you and brutus howell will make
                        sure that doesn't happen.

                                  paul
                        easy enough to say. we can't watch
                        him every minute, hal.

                                  hal
                        stick with it. may not be much
                        longer. i have it on good
                        authority that percy has an
                        application in at briar ridge.

                                  paul
                        the mental hospital?

                                  hal
                               (nods)
                        administration job. better pay.

                                  paul
                        then why's he still here? he could
                        get that application pushed
                        through...hell, with his
                        connections, he could have any
                        state job he wants.

              hal has no answer. paul look off toward bitterbuck.

                                  paul
                        tell you what i think. i think he
                        just wants to see one cook up
                        close.

              hal follows paul's gaze, takes his meaning.

                                  hal
                        well, he'll get his chance then,
                        won't he? maybe then he'll be
                        satisfied and move on. in the
                        meantime, you'll keep the peace.

                                  paul
                        of course.

                                  hal
                        thank you, paul.

              hal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers.

                                  paul
                        you give melinda my love, okay? i
                        bet that x-ray turns out to be
                        nothing at all.

              hal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world
              on his shoulders. paul looks at the letter again...

              tight on letter

              ...which is head: date of execution."

                                                       dissolve to:
