              int. e block - night

              paul and dean enter to find brutal trying not to wake the
              cons in their cells by laughing too loudly. they follows his
              gaze down the mile, see nothing, turn to him like he's crazy.

                                  brutal
                        i guess the legislature loosened
                        those purse-strings enough to hire
                        on a new guard.
                               (off their looks)
                        look again. he's right there.

              paul and dean look again and this time they see it:

              a tiny brown mouse is coming up the mile. it trots a short
              distance, peers right and left as if checking the snoring
              inmates in their cells, then makes another forward spurt.

                                  paul
                        he's doing a cell check.

              this gets them all trying not to laugh. the mouse draws ever
              closer. dean starts to look worried.

                                  dean
                        it ain't normal for a mouse to
                        come up on people that way. maybe
                        it's rabid.

                                  brutal
                        oh, my christ. the big mouse
                        expert. the mouse man. you see it
                        foaming at the mouth, mouse man?

                                  dean
                               (dubious)
                        i don't see its mouth at all.

              that does it--paul and brutal burst out laughing. the mouse
              stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly
              around its paws as if to wait. the guards fall silent,
              fascinated. bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch.

              brutal tears off a piece of his half-eaten corned beef
              sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers. the mouse
              rises up, appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes.

                                  dean
                        aw, brutal, no! we'll be hip-deep
                        in mice around here...

                                  brutal
                               (to paul)
                        i just wanna see what he'll do. in
                        the interests of science, like.

              paul shrugs. brutal drops the scrap. the mouse grabs it and
              eats, sitting up like a dog doing a trick.

              the mouse turns and scurries back down the mile, vanishing
              under the restraint room door at the far end. dean throws
              paul an "i told you so" look.

                                  dean
                        he's in the damn restraint room.
                        you know he's gonna be chewing the
                        padding out of walls and making
                        himself a nice little nest.

              brutal give paul a sheepish look--well? paul sighs.

                                  paul
                        all right. let's get the damn
                        mouse.

              they stride grimly down the mile to the restraint room door,
              men on a mission. coffey's awake now, peering from his cot.

                                  coffey
                        saw me a mouse go by.

                                  paul
                        it was a dream. go back to sleep.

                                  coffey
                        weren't no dream. it was a mouse
                        all right.

                                  paul
                        can't put anything over on you.

              paul unlocks the door, revealing a padded room filled with
              storage: cleaning supplies, buckets of paint, mops and
              ladders, you name it. brutal shrugs off his jacket. paul
              grabs a mop from a steel bucket, hands it to dean.

                                  paul
                        dean, watch the door. he tries to
                        get past you, whack him.

                                  dean
                        brutal or the mouse?

                                  brutal
                        har har, mouse man.

              brutal and paul start doing the heavy lifting, muscling an
              unused filing cabinet out the door...

                                                       dissolve:

              ...and they finally relay the last few heavy buckets of paint
              onto the mile. paul and brutal catch their breath, scanning
              the empty restraint room. their eyes go glaringly to dean.

                                  paul
                        you let him get past you.

                                  dean
                        no i didn't, i was here all the
                        time!

                                  brutal
                        then where the hell is he?

              they move slowly into the room, peering into every nook and
              cranny, utterly mystified. brutal shakes his head.

                                  brutal
                        three grown men. outsmarted by a
                        mouse.

                                  dean
                        well, bright side is, all this
                        commotion probably scared him off
                        for good.

                                  paul
                        yeah, that's right. that's the
                        last we'll see of him...

                                                       fade to black

              in blackness, a title card appears:

                                "the mouse on the mile"

                                                       cut to:
