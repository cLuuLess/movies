              int. e block - day

              a low, static shot. green floor stretching before us. harry
              and bill dodge are at the desk b.g., doing paperwork and
              filing chores. percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and
              combing his hair...

              ...and into this quiet shot, deep in foreground, creeps the
              mouse. he starts walking the mile as before...

              ...right toward percy.

              coffey

              stares through his bars as the mouse goes by...

              percy

              keeps combing his hair, unaware...

              del

              sits quietly picking his nose in his cell. the mouse appears
              outside the bars, cruising inexorably up the mile. del turns
              slowly, watches the mouse go by...

              percy

              still grooming himself, still unaware...

              the mouse

              keeps coming closer. angle up to bitterbuck peering through
              his bars, watching him go by...

              percy

              keeps working that comb--and freezes at the sound of a tiny
              squeak. his head swivels slowly...

              ...and there's the mouse. staring at him.

              that moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time
              itself. if mice have a natural enemy, percy is it.

                                  paul
                        you little son of a bitch.

              harry and bill glance up from their work.

                                  harry
                        well, i'll be damned. there he is,
                        big as billy-be-frigged. i thought
                        brutal was pulling my leg.

                                  bill
                        that's a goddamn mouse.

                                  harry
                        yeah. brute said he was in here
                        last night begging for food, came
                        right up to the desk.

                                  bill
                        my ass. give him some room, percy,
                        see what he does.

              percy takes a few careful steps back, eyes never leaving the
              mouse. (percy's hand starts easing toward the handle of his
              baton.) the mouse comes up to the desk as before.

                                  harry
                        brave little bastard, gotta give
                        him that.

              harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it. the
              mouse picks it up, starts to eat. (percy's hand inches ever
              closer to his baton).

                                  bill
                        here, lemme try.

              bill drops a piece of cracker. the mouse ignores it
              completely, keeping its beady little eyes on harry. (percy's
              hand starts easing his baton from its holster.)

                                  bill
                        maybe he's full.

                                  harry
                               (grins)
                        maybe he knows you're just a
                        floater. gotta be an e block
                        regular to feed the e block mouse,
                        don'cha know...

              harry drops another piece--and sure enough, the mouse starts
              to eat. harry's smile fades. he and bill trade a look.

                                  harry
                        i was just kidding ab--

              percy lets rip a bellowing war cry ("yaaaahhh!") and launches
              his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone.

              the mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over
              his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the
              floor. apparently remembering a pressing engagement
              elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the
              restraint room.

              percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying
              to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping
              with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by
              inches...

              ...and thus is the green mile traversed, with percy stomping
              and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts
              yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like jim
              thorpe heading for the endzone...

              the mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room
              door. percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration:

                                  percy
                        fuck!

              he fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the
              while:

                                  percy
                        i'm gonna rip your diseased head
                        off, you little piece of shit!

              outside e block

              paul and brutal are arriving for work--they pause, hearing
              percy's yells drifting from the windows. the regular cons in
              the yard are drifting curiously to the fence, wondering if a
              riot's brewing. paul and brutal take off running--

              inside e block

              --and rush in to find:

                                  harry
                        percy met your mouse.

              harry points. percy's down at the far end, rummaging wildly
              in the restraint room, tossing shit out onto the mile.

                                  percy
                        it's in here somewhere! i'm gonna
                        squish the little son of a bitch!

              he starts muscling the filing cabinet out the door, kicking
              buckets out of his way. brutal calls out to him:

                                  brutal
                        percy, we already tried that--

                                  percy
                        what? whad'ja say?

                                  brutal
                        i said--

              paul stops brutal with a look--don't you dare stop him.

                                  brutal
                        --uh, knock yourself out. hope you
                        nail the bastard.

              paul crosses his arms and smiles, leans back against the desk
              to wait...

                                                       dissolve:

              ...and percy hauls the last of the stuff out, exhausted. he
              steps back in and looks around, unable to believe there's no
              mouse cowering in the corner. paul and the men approach,
              keeping straight faces, navigating the crap in the corridor.

                                  brutal
                        gosh. ain't in there, huh? don't
                        that beat the mousie band?

              percy keeps scanning the restraint room. the others all look
              to paul, waiting for him to speak--you're the boss.

                                  paul
                        percy. you want to think about
                        what you were doing just now.

                                  percy
                               (turns, glaring)
                        i know what i was doing. trying to
                        get the mouse. you blind?

                                  harry
                        you also scared the living crap
                        out of me and bill. and them.

              he cocks a thumb at the inmates in their cells.

                                  percy
                        so what? they aren't in cradle-
                        school, case you didn't notice...

                               (directed at paul)
                        ...although you treat them that
                        way half the time.

                                  brutal
                        we don't scare 'em any more than
                        we have to, percy. they're under
                        enough strain as it is.

                                  paul
                        men under strain can snap. hurt
                        themselves. hurt others. that's
                        why our job is talking, not
                        yelling. you'll do better to think
                        of this place like an intensive
                        care ward in a hospital--

                                  percy
                        i think of it as a bucket of piss
                        to drown rats in. that's all.
                               (scans their faces)
                        anybody doesn't like it can kiss
                        my ass. how's that sit?

              brutal steps forward, wanting to slug the little bastard.
              percy shies back, but keeps his bravado up:

                                  percy
                        try it. you'll be on the bread
                        lines before the week is out.

                                  paul
                        we all know who your connections
                        are, percy...
                               (steps close)
                        ...but you ever threaten a man on
                        this block again, we're all gonna
                        have a go. job be damned.

                                  percy
                        big talk. you done?

                                  paul
                        get all this shit back in the
                        restraint room. you're cluttering
                        up my mile.

              they turn and walk away, leaving percy as we

                                                       dissolve to:
