              int. e block access tunnel - night

              bitterbuck's dead face stares up at us from a gurney. a hand
              reaches down, gives his cheek a squeeze. tilt up to:

                                  percy
                        adios, chief. drop us a card from
                        hell, let us know if it's hot
                        enough.

              brutal knocks percy's hand away, shoves him aside.

                                  brutal
                        he's paid what he's owed. he's
                        square with the house again, so
                        keep your goddamn hands off him.

              he draws the sheet over bitterbuck's face, wheels the gurney
              down the tunnel. percy throws a look to paul.

                                  percy
                        what's up his ass?

                                  paul
                        you, percy. always you.

              paul brushes past him, but:

                                  percy
                        you gotta hate the new boy? that
                        the way it is around here?

                                  paul
                               (turns back)
                        why not just move on? go to briar
                        ridge.
                               (off his look)
                        yeah, i know about it. sounds like
                        a good job.

                                  percy
                        i might take it, too. soon as you
                        put me out front.

              paul cocks his head--excuse me?

                                  percy
                        you heard me. i want brutal's spot
                        for the next execution.

                                  paul
                               (beat)
                        what's with you? seeing a man die
                        isn't enough? you gotta be close
                        enough to smell his nuts cook?

                                  percy
                        i wanna be out front, is all. just
                        one time. then you'll be rid of me.

                                  paul
                        if i say no?

                                  percy
                        i might just stick around for
                        good, make me a career of this.

              paul just shakes his head in wonder and walks away.

                                                       fade to:
