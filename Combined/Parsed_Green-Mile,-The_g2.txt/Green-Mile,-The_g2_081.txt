              ext. woods - night

              coffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. tilt up to his
              face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell.

              he see the guards throwing him anxious looks. he misreads
              this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. they do it,
              just to make him happy.

                                  paul
                        c'mon, big boy, keep moving.

              a few fireflies come winking through frame as the group
              presses on...

              another area/woods

              the trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. more
              fireflies are flitting into view, trailing in their wake...

                                  brutal
                        how far is it?

                                  harry
                        just up ahead...

              harry brings them to a thicket of trees. they start removing
              branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old farmall truck
              hidden in the brush.

              the men pause. even more fireflies are swirling around them,
              growing in number. it's getting downright weird.

              coffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. a childlike
              smile has utterly transformed his face. he raises his hand,
              letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers.

                                  coffey
                        hey there, little firefly. where's
                        mrs. firefly this evening?

              another firefly joins the first, both now dancing and
              blinking around his fingers. coffey laughs again.

                                  coffey
                        oh, there you is. you come out to
                        play too?

              the men stand gaping. the fireflies are flitting to coffey as
              if to a beacon. he waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking
              and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust.

              they begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing
              planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off
              his ebony skin. coffey's eyes meet paul's.

                                  paul
                        they seem...drawn to you.

                                  coffey
                        i love 'em, is why. they don't
                        think no hurtful thoughts. they's
                        just happy to be. happy little
                        lightning bugs...

              the men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified.
              harry gives paul a look--can we go? please?

                                  paul
                        c'mon, big boy. upsy-daisy.

              coffey clambers up on the stakebed. paul and brutal join him.
              harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button...

              on the stakebed

              ...while coffey sits with his back to the cab.

                                  paul
                        john? do you know where we're
                        taking you?

                                  coffey
                        help a lady?

                                  paul
                        that's right. help a lady. but how
                        did you know?

                                  coffey
                        dunno. tell the truth, boss, i
                        don't know much'a anything. never
                        have.

              the truck pulls out. coffey waves as the fireflies get left
              behind, dwindling away like stars.

                                  coffey
                        bye, fireflies. bye.

              wide angle of countryside

              the truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless
              fireflies swirling in its wake...

                                                       dissolve to:
