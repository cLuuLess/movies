              int. bedroom - night

              ...and we find them having a wild tumble in the sheets, both
              moaning and groaning, sweating and panting. she pushes him
              flat on the bed, pauses to catch her breath...

                                  jan
                        those must've been some pills.

              ...and they keep going, rutting like crazed weasels...
