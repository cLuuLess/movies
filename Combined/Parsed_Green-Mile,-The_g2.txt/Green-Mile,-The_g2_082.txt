              ext. moores house - night

              headlights come over the rise. the truck appears, rumbling
              down toward the house. the world is isolated and still.

              in the truck cab

              harry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on.
              silence now, save for the trilling of crickets.

              in the stakebed

              paul and brutal both look terrified now that they're actually
              here. an urgent whisper:

                                  brutal
                        we can still turn back.

              paul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but:

                                  coffey
                        boss, look. someone's up.

              lights are coming on inside the house. coffey rises and steps
              down from the truck, pulling paul along. brutal follows them.

                                  brutal
                        this is a mistake. christ, paul,
                        what were we thinking?

                                  paul
                        too late now. harry, keep john
                        here until we call you.

              paul and brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside
              the house keep clicking on. the last one finally comes on
              over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin
              barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.

                                  hal
                        who the hell goes there at two-
                        thirty in the goddamn morning?

                                  paul
                        hal, it's us! it's paul and
                        brutal--it's us!

              the door swings wider, revealing hal's face gaunt and haggard
              in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:

                                  hal
                        paul, what are you doing here at
                        this hour? jesus, it's not a
                        lockdown, is it? or a riot?

                                  paul
                        hal, god's sakes, take your finger
                        off the trigger...

              hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.

                                  hal
                        are you hostages? who's out there?
                        who's by that truck?

              coffey steps into the glare of headlights with harry tugging
              on his arm, trying to hold him back. hal cocks both hammers.

                                  hal
                        john coffey! halt! halt right
                        there or i shoot!

              his aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs:

                                  melinda (o.s.)
                        hal? who are you talking to, you
                        fucking cocksucker?

              a frozen moment. hal mortified. paul gives him a look--is
              that melinda?

              hal's shotgun shifts back to coffey--but paul steps in front
              of the muzzle.

                                  paul
                        no one's hurt. we're here to help.

                                  hal
                        help what? i don't understand. is
                        this a prison break?

                                  paul
                        i can't explain what it is. you
                        just have to trust me.

              coffey comes up the steps, brushes paul aside, stops before
              the warden. hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's
              that benign hypnotic effect coffey has.

                                  hal
                        what do you...want?

                                  melinda
                        hal! make them go away! no
                        salesmen in the middle of the
                        night! no fuller brushes! no
                        french knickers with come in the
                        crotch! tell them to take a flying
                        fuck in a rolling d...d...

              we hear the sound of glass breaking, then she begins to sob.

                                  coffey
                               (a whisper)
                        just to help. just to help, boss,
                        that's all.

                                  hal
                        you can't. no one can.

              coffey pulls the shotgun gently from hal's grasp, hands it to
              paul. coffey moves past hal into the house...
