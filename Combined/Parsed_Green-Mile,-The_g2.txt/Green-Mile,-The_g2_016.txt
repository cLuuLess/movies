              int. e block (the green mile) - day

              brutus howell(nicknamed "brutal" for his intimidating size,
              but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the
              entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing
              slot. he sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate.

              he turns and nods to fellow guard dean stanton sitting at the
              duty desk, then cross the green mile--a wide corridor of
              faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom,
              with four large cells to a side.

              brutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly.

                                  brutal
                        paul? prisoner.

                                  paul (o.s.)
                        christ. gimme a minute.

              brutal waits patiently, a bit embarrassed. he finally hears
              a thin trickle, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain.

                                  brutal
                        you all right in there?

                                  paul (o.s.)
                        for a man pissing razor blades.

              the door opens, revealing paul's pale and sweaty face.

                                  brutal
                        you should'a took the day off,
                        gone to see the doctor.

                                  paul
                        with a new arrival? you know
                        better. besides, it's not as bad
                        as it was. i think it's clearing
                        up.

              they hear the truck honking as it rumbles up outside. paul
              gives them a nod to resume their positions. paul walks down
              the mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside--the
              first is arlen bitterbuck, a washita cherokee; the second is
              eduard delacroix("del"), a skinny cajun.

                                  del
                        new boy coming in, boss?

                                  paul
                        never you mind, del, you just keep
                        your nose quietly on your business.

              paul arrives at the end of the mile, takes up a position at
              an empty cell. (down at this end, past the cells, is e
              block's version of the "hole" -- a padded room where violent
              inmates are sent to cool off. it isn't used very often...in
              fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.)

              brutal

              peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.

                                  brutal
                        damn, they're riding on the axle.
                        what'd they do, bust the springs?

              guards percy wetmore and harry terwilliger of e block emerge
              from the back of the truck and step down, turn back...

              tighter angle on back of truck

              we get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of
              gigantic black feet step down into the yard...and the rear of
              the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs.

              brutal

              sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.

                                  brutal
                        paul? you might wanna reconsider
                        getting in the cell with this guy?

                                  paul
                        why's that?

                                  brutal
                        he's enormous.

                                  paul
                        can't be bigger than you.

              brutal tosses him a look--just wait. he swings the door open
              in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at:

              john coffey

              is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his
              massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old
              scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending
              at mid-calf. he looks dull and confused, as if wondering
              where he is and how he got there. percy and harry lead him
              toward e block in shackles. percy's got his hickory baton out
              of it custom-made holster, hollering:

                                  percy
                        dead man walking! dead man walking
                        here!

              inside the cellblock

              paul can't see them approach from where he stands, but he can
              certainly hear percy:

                                  paul
                        jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's
                        he yelling about?

              up by the door, brutal just rolls his eyes. percy is the
              first one through the door, still hollering...

                                  percy
                        dead man walking!

              ...then coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow
              blotting out brutal and dean as his massive frame fills the
              door. everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of
              "hold shit" written on everybody's faces. percy keeps yanking
              on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:

                                  percy
                        dead man walking! dead man--

                                  paul
                        percy, that's enough.

              percy falls reproachfully silent. paul doesn't dignify it,
              just motions for them to come on. the procession comes down
              the mile, with brutal and dean bringing up rear.

                                  brutal
                        you sure you wanna be in there
                        with him?

                                  paul
                               (looks to coffey)
                        am i gonna have trouble with you,
                        big boy?

              coffey shakes his head slowly. paul takes the clipboard
              transfer papers from harry, turns and enters the cell.

              coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he
              doesn't understand the concept. paul motions him to come on
              in. coffey starts to comply, but percy raps him smartly with
              the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster.

              coffey flinches, enters the cell. paul stares angrily at
              percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm
              of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.

                                  paul
                        percy. they're moving house over
                        in the infirmary. why don't you go
                        see if they could use some help?

                                  percy
                        they got all the men they need.

                                  paul
                        why don't you just go make sure?
                               (off his look)
                        i don't care where you go, percy,
                        as long as it's not here at this
                        very moment.

              percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm. he looks
              like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and
              stalks angrily up the mile instead...

              ...and sees del at his bars, smiling. infuriated, percy
              swings his baton and smashes del's fingers with a loud crack.
              del jerks back, howling in pain:

                                  del
                        oww, god, he bus' my fingers!

                                  percy
                        wiped that grin off your shitpoke
                        face, didn't i

                                  paul
                        goddamn it, percy! get the hell
                        off my block!

              percy throws paul a look of disdain--your block, huh? he
              swaggers out. del's on his knees, weeping from the pain:

                                  del
                        oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my
                        fingers for true...

                                  paul
                        we'll get it looked at, del, now
                        keep yourself quiet like i said!

              del falls silent, moaning over his hand. paul turns to
              coffey, who looks unsettled by all the commotion.

                                  paul
                        if i let harry take those chains
                        off you, you gonna be nice?

              coffey nods. harry enters to remove coffey's shackles.

                                  paul
                        your name is john coffey.

                                  coffey
                               (deep and quiet)
                        yes, sir, boss, like the drink,
                        only not spelt the same.

                                  paul
                        so you can spell, can you?

              coffey shakes his head. harry steps out.

                                  paul
                        my name is paul edgecomb. if i'm
                        not here, you can ask for mr.
                        terwilliger, mr. howell, or mr.
                        stanton...those gentlemen there.
                               (beat)
                        this isn't like the rest of the
                        prison. it's a quiet place, we
                        like to keep it that way.

              coffey considers this carefully, puzzled.

                                  coffey
                        it weren't me making all the
                        noise, boss.

                                  paul
                               (eyes narrowing)
                        you having a joke on me, john
                        coffey?

                                  coffey
                        no, sir.

              paul sees he isn't joking, continues:

                                  paul
                        your time here can be easy or
                        hard, depends on you. if you
                        behave, you get to walk in the
                        exercise yard every day.

                        we might even play some music on
                        the radio from time to time.
                        questions?

              coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask:

                                  coffey
                        do you leave a light on after
                        bedtime?

              paul blinks. it's the last thing he expected. coffey smiles
              uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.

                                  coffey
                        because i get a little scared in
                        the dark sometimes. if it's a
                        strange place.

              paul looks to his men. the guards are trading glances.

                                  paul
                        it's pretty bright in here all
                        night long. we keep half the
                        lights burning in the corridor.

                                  coffey
                        cor'der.

              coffey looks confused. paul points to the lights lining the
              ceiling of the green mile in wire mesh cages.

                                  paul
                        right out there.

              coffey nods, relieved. then he surprises everybody by
              offering paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. paul
              hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by
              accepting. coffey's hand swallows his. coffey shakes gently,
              lets go.

              paul steps from the cell. brutal slides the door shut, locks
              it. coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then
              sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees.
              he looks up at paul, his voice soft as a whisper:

                                  coffey
                        couldn't help it, boss. i tried to
                        take it back, but it was too late.

              paul turns, leads his men up the mile...

              paul's inner office

              ...and they enter a few moments later. paul is furious, but
              keeping a lid on his temper:

                                  paul
                        dean, run delacroix up to the
                        infirmary and see if his fingers
                        are broken.

                                  brutal
                        course they're broken, i heard the
                        damn bones crack. goddamn percy.

                                  harry
                        you hear what he was yelling when
                        we brought the big dummy in?

                                  paul
                        how could i miss it, harry? the
                        whole prison heard.

              this makes brutal snort, breaking the tension--the others
              can't help smiling.

                                  brutal
                        you'll probably have to answer for
                        sending him off the mile. he's
                        gonna cause you trouble over this,
                        you mark me.

                                  paul
                        i'll chew that food when i have
                        to. right now i wanna hear about
                        the new inmate...aside from how
                        big he is, okay?

                                  brutal
                               (smiles)

                                  paul
                        seems meek enough. looks like they
                        sent us an imbecile to execute.

                                  harry
                        imbecile or not, he deserves to
                        fry for what he done. here...

              harry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber
              bands on the desk before paul--coffey's file.

                                  harry
                        ...make your blood curdle.
