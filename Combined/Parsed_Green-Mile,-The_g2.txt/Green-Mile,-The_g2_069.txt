              ext. backyard - morning

              ...and they walk outside to find melinda moores sitting in
              the sun, frail and wasted, a blanket on her knees. she'd be
              beautiful if not for the cancer killing her.

              paul is shocked at her appearance, hides it as best as he
              can. jan covers this for him--she drops to melinda's side
              with a warm smile and a kiss, takes the woman's frail hands
              in hers.

              paul catches jan's eye. the look he gives her says it all--i
              don't know what i'd do without you...

              ...and we find paul and hal talking quietly over beers while
              the women visit b.g.:

                                  hal
                        she's having one of her good days.
                        i thank god for that.

                                  paul
                        what a bad day?

                                  hal
                               (beat)
                        sometimes she's...not herself
                        anymore. she swears.

                                  paul
                        swears.

                                  hal
                        it just pops out, the most awful
                        language you can imagine. she
                        doesn't even know she's doing it.
                        i didn't know she'd ever heard
                        words like that...and to hear her
                        say them in her sweet voice...
                               (gazes off)
                        i'm glad she's having a good day,
                        paul. i'm glad for you and jan.
