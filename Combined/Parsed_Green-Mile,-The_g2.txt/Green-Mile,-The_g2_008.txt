              ext. woods - morning

              ...as camera booms down through the trees to find paul
              wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking
              for all the world like red riding hood in his plastic poncho.

              it's silent here, like a church. the only sounds we hear are
              the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the
              woodpecker.

              a rustling sound makes paul freeze. he turns, becomes
              transfixed. softly:

                                  paul
                        oh, my...

              reverse angle

              reveals a magnificent buck, not twenty feet away, misty
              breath punching the cold morning air. they watch each other
              for an endless moment, both standing stock still...

              ...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the
              foliage. paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder.
              he takes another bite of toast, moves on...

              ...and we pan with him to reveal a pair of old wooden storage
              shacks along the path up ahead.
