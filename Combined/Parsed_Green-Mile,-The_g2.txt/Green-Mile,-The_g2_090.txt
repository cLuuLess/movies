              ext. paul's house - dusk

              tight on paul as softly:

                                  paul
                        it makes sense. i read the file.
                        hal even said it himself. wharton
                        rambled all over the state last
                        few years, causing trouble. hell,
                        longer than that. been at it since
                        he was ten. vandalism. petty
                        theft. setting fires.

              angle shifts to include jan, brutal, harry and dean. they're
              in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house.
              the sun is setting, turning the horizon fiery.

                                  jan
                        you saw him. you actually saw this
                        wild bill person take those girls.

                                  paul
                        their father hired him on for a
                        few days last spring, help repair
                        the barn. cheap labor, just
                        another drifter...

                                  brutal
                        only not.

                                  paul
                        sick bastard came back a month
                        later, just before dawn. took the
                        girls...did what he did. coffey
                        found them afterwards and tried to
                        help. it was too late.

                                  jan
                               (absorbs this)
                        then you can stop it. the
                        execution, i mean. get coffey a
                        new trial.

                                  paul
                        based on what, honey? some kind of
                        magical vision i had?

                                  jan
                        show this farmer--what's his name,
                        detterick?--show him a picture of
                        wild bill.
                               (off their looks)
                        why not? if wharton was there...if
                        the farmer can identify his
                        picture and they know he was
                        there...

                                  brutal
                        him being there in may doesn't
                        mean he came back and killed those
                        girls in june. even if he was
                        committing other crimes.

                                  paul
                        they got their killer as far as
                        they're concerned.

                        hell, coffey's own lawyer would
                        come throw the switch if we let
                        him.

                                  jan
                        then lie.

                                  paul
                        lie? about what?

                                  jan
                        tell them wharton confessed to the
                        crime. brutus, you can back him
                        up, say you heard it too. you can
                        say that's what set percy off. he
                        shot wharton because he couldn't
                        stand thinking of what happened to
                        those two little girls, it snapped
                        his mind...
                               (seeing their looks)
                        ...what? what now?

                                  dean
                        we never reported anything like
                        that. we would've, too, everybody
                        knows it. it's part of our job.

                                  brutal
                        besides, confessing don't make it
                        so. slugs like wild bill lie about
                        everything. crimes they committed,
                        women they had, even the weather.

                                  jan
                        but he was there! he painted their
                        barn! he ate dinner with them!

                                  paul
                        all the more reason he might take
                        credit for the crime. he's gonna
                        fry anyway, so why not boast?

              jan stands thinking for a moment, then:

                                  jan
                        all right. then you've got to get
                        john coffey out on your own.

                                  harry
                        ma'am?

                                  jan
                        you did it once, didn't you? only
                        this time, don't bring him back.

              dean blinks, stunned by this notion. gently:

                                  dean
                        ma'am, your son's grown up and
                        moved away. my kids are just
                        starting kindergarten. will you be
                        the one to explain to them why
                        their daddy's in prison?

                                  jan
                        work out a plan. make it look like
                        a real escape.

                                  harry
                        better be a plan an imbecile could
                        dream up. nobody'd believe it
                        otherwise.

                                  brutal
                        even if we did think of something,
                        it wouldn't do any good.

                                  jan
                        why not? just why the hell not?

                                  paul
                        because he's a six-foot-eight-inch
                        baldheaded black man with barely
                        enough brains to feed himself. how
                        long you think it'd be before he
                        was recaptured? two hours? six?

              jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand. softly:

                                  jan
                        do you mean to kill him, you
                        cowards? do you?

              paul tries to take her hand. she wrenches away, furious.

                                  jan
                        don't touch me! next week this
                        time you'll be a murderer, no
                        better than that man wharton, so
                        don't touch me!

              she runs off toward the house, starting to sob as we

                                                       dissolve to:

              int  paul's kitchen - night

              paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours, at his regular
              place, sipping his beer. irving berlin's "remember" plays
              softly on the radio. jan comes down, looking miserable and
              exhausted.

                                  jan
                        i'm so sorry i called you a
                        coward. i feel worse about that
                        than anything i've ever said to
                        you in our whole marriage.

                                  paul
                        even that time we went camping and
                        you called me old stinky sam?

              she can't help smiling at that. he returns the smile, offers
              her a sip of beer. she takes it, sits.

                                  jan
                        does hal know? that coffey's
                        innocent, i mean?
                               (paul shakes his head)
                        can he help? does he have the
                        influence to do something about
                        this?

                                  paul
                        no.

                                  jan
                        then don't tell him. if he can't
                        help, don't tell him. ever.

                                  paul
                        i won't.

                                  jan
                               (beat)
                        there's no way out of this for
                        you, is there?

                                  paul
                        no. i've been thinking about it,
                        too, believe me.
                               (beat)
                        tell you the truth, honey. i've
                        done some things in my life i'm
                        not proud of, but this is the
                        first time i've ever felt in real
                        danger of hell.

                                  jan
                        hell? oh paul...
                               (touches his face)
                        talk to him. talk to john. find
                        out what he wants.
