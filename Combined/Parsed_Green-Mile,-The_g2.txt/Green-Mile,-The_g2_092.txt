              int. e block - night

              four pairs of feet come marching up the green mile.

              angle on coffey

              paul appears at the bars with brutal, harry, and dean.
              nothing is said. coffey knows why they're here. he rises as
              brutal unlocks the cell, slides the door open. coffey steps
              out, looks around at their dazed and sad faces.

                                  coffey
                        i be all right, fellas. this
                        here's the hard part. i be all
                        right in a little while.

              paul indicates st. christopher medal around john's neck:

                                  paul
                        john, i should have that just for
                        now. i'll give it back after.

              john lets him take the necklace. paul pockets it. they start
              to walk the mile as:

                                  coffey
                        you know, i fell asleep this
                        afternoon and had me a dream. i
                        dreamed about del's mouse.

                                  paul
                        did you, john?

                                  coffey
                        i dreamed he got down to that
                        place boss howell talked about,
                        that mouseville place. i dreamed
                        there was kids, and how they
                        laughed at his tricks! my!

              he laughs at the memory of it, then grows more serious:

                                  coffey
                        i dreamed those two little blonde-
                        headed girls were there. they 'us
                        laughing, too. i put my arms
                        around 'em and sat 'em on my
                        knees, and there 'us no blood
                        comin' outta their hair and they
                        'us fine. we all watch mr. jingles
                        roll that spool, and how we did
                        laugh. fit to bus', we was.

              behind them, dean stifles a sob.

              paul's inner office

              coffey kneels. paul joins him, self-conscious and uncertain.

                                  paul
                        what should we pray for, john?

                                  coffey
                        strength?

              paul nods--strength it is. dean surprises brutal and harry by
              also kneeling. brutal and harry hesitate...then join them.

                                  paul
                        god, please help us finish what
                        we've started, and please welcome
                        this man, john coffey--like the
                        drink, but not spelled the same--
                        into heaven and give him peace.
                        please help us to see him off the
                        best we can and let nothing go
                        wrong. amen.

              paul starts to rise, but coffey takes his hand.

                                  coffey
                        i know a prayer i once heard. can
                        i say it?

                                  paul
                        you go right ahead, john. take all
                        the time you need.

              coffey closes his eyes, frowning in deep concentration.

                                  coffey
                        baby jesus, meek and mild, pray
                        for me...

              and paul sees:

              kathe and cora detterick kneeling together in the enclosed
              porch that night, just before their bedtime:

                                  kathe and cora
                        ...and every child. be my
                        strength, be my friend...

              and then the vision is gone as:

                                  coffey
                        ...be with me until the end. amen.

              coffey rises, offers paul his hand, helps him up.

              execution chamber

              full house tonight. bill dodge is waiting at old sparky.

              silence as coffey is led in, all eyes on him. klaus and
              marjorie detterick are in the front row. she mutters:

                                  marjorie
                        die slow, you bastard.

              coffey

              is faltering as paul and brutal bring him to the chair.

                                  coffey
                        they's a lot of folks here hate
                        me. a lot. i can feel it. like
                        bees stinging me. it hurts.

                                  brutal
                        feel how we feel, then. we don't
                        hate you--can you feel that?

              coffey tries to take comfort in it, but flinches as:

                                  marjorie
                        kill him twice, you boys! you go
                        on and kill that raping baby-
                        killer twice, that'd be fine!

              she dissolves into tears. klaus pulls her against his
              shoulder, looking dazed by the whole thing.

              paul and brutal turn john around, sit him down. paul notices
              dean crying again, his back to the witnesses. they kneel to
              apply the leg clamps, while brutal and harry secure the arms.

                                  paul
                        wipe you face before you stand up,
                        dean.

              dean nods, wiping his face with the sleeve of his coat. they
              rise, stepping back. this time, paul's out front:

                                  paul
                        roll on one.

              van hay cranks the generator. the lights flare hotter and
              brighter. it's just like in melinda's bedroom the night
              coffey cured her with a kiss. airless and bright, dreamlike.

                                  marjorie
                        does it hurt yet? i hope it does!
                        i hope it hurts like hell!

                                  paul
                        john coffey...you have been
                        condemned to die in the electric
                        chair by a jury of your
                        peers...sentence imposed by a
                        judge in good standing in this
                        state. do you have anything to say
                        before sentence is carried out?

              john hesitates, nods.

                                  coffey
                        i'm sorry for what i am.

                                  marjorie
                        you ought to be! oh, you monster,
                        you damn well ought to be!

              brutal takes the mask from the hook to draw it over coffey's
              head. coffey looks to paul with terrified, pleading eyes.

                                  coffey
                        please, boss, don't put that thing
                        over my face. don't put me in the
                        dark, i's afraid of the dark.

                                  paul
                        all right, john.

              brutal puts the mask back, proceeds with the sponge.

              in tight angles

              the cap is lowered, the straps drawn. coffey is breathing
              fast, terrified, muttering under his breath:

                                  coffey
                        ...heaven...i'm in heaven...
                        heaven...heaven...heaven...

              the witnesses

              sit and wait, barely breathing.

              jack van hay

              is poised at the switch, wondering why the order won't come.

              paul

              is staring at coffey, unable to say the words.

                                  brutal
                               (whispers)
                        paul. you have to say it. you have
                        to give the order.

              paul can't. he reaches out and touches coffey's hand. their
              fingers clasp. in that moment, staring into his eyes, paul
              hears the last thought that ever goes through coffey's head:

                                  coffey
                               (whispered v.o.)
                        he kill 'em with they love. that's
                        how it is ever' day. all over the
                        worl'...

              their fingers disengage. paul steps back, eyes still locked
              with coffey's, and says the hardest words he's ever spoken:

                                  paul
                        roll on two.

              van hay throws the switch. coffey surges forward, fingers
              splayed and jittering past old sparky's arms.

              lights begin blowing out all over the mile, raining shattered
              glass and sparks. some of the witnesses scream.

              a thin line of blood comes trickling out of klaus detterick's
              nose. he reaches up, absently wipes it away.

              coffey's eyes are locked on paul's, riding the lightning all
              the way. he finally slumps. van hay kills the current.

              coffey's expression is peaceful, as if sleeping. a final pair
              of tears drift gently down his cheeks.

                                                       cut to:
