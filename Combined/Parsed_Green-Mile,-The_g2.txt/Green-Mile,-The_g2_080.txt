              ext. prison wall - night

              a massive iron door squeals open onto a little-used fenced
              enclosure. paul and the others bring coffey up from the
              tunnel below, emerging into the night. coffey's breath
              catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars, pointing:

                                  coffey
                        look, boss! it's cassie, the lady
                        in the rocking chair!

                                  paul
                        shhh. john, you have to be quiet
                        now.

                                  coffey
                               (whispering)
                        you see her? you see the lady?

                                  brutal
                        we see her, john.

              harry goes first, hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to
              unlock the gate...

              wide shot of prison

              ...while tower guards huddle in their enclosure atop the
              walls. an occasional spotlight cuts the darkness. fireflies
              dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see.

              four dark figures detach from the shadows, hurrying across
              the lonely country road into the fields on the far side...
