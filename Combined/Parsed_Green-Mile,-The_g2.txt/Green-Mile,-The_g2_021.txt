              ext. country road/field - day (flashback)

              ---and we see cars and trucks pulling up, men jumping out
              with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where
              klaus is hollering and waving his arms. deputy mcgee comes
              sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his
              lungs--

                                  mcgee
                        i want all the weapons unloaded,
                        y'hear? take out your shells, i
                        won't have a man shot by accident
                        today! bobo, where them dogs?

              --and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck,
              howling down the incline to lead the chase...

              various angles

              ...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the
              spot where klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow
              fabric, turns and screams...

                                  klaus
                        oh, lord, this belongs to my
                        katie...

              ...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: a
              blood-drenched area of tramped grass. a little girl's bloody
              nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. some of these
              strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the
              sight of it. their blood freezes in their veins as an inhuman
              howling commences up ahead. it's like nothing they've ever
              heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike.

              ...as paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head...

                                  paul
                        jesus.
