              int. e block - night

              a slow tracking shot of the green floor takes us past a tiny
              scrap of break...and then another...and then past a mousetrap
              primed with a scrap of bacon...

              ...and we keep following a long trail of bread scraps and
              mousetraps until we come to percy, alone on the mile,
              carefully laying the last mousetrap down...

              ...and he scoots back against the desk to wait, crouched and
              holding his breath, eyes riveted to the restraint room door
              for any sign of his furry nemesis...

              ...and camera booms slowly down off his face, dipping down to
              floor level...

              ...where the mouse is revealed under the desk, peering in the
              same direction as percy, wondering what the hell's so
              interesting down there. it hops further out to see...

              angle of percy from floor level

              ...and the mouse enters frame, hopping out a few more steps,
              mouse and man staring in the same direction.

              a long beat. percy turns, looks down at the mouse. the mouse
              turns, looks up at percy...

              ...and all hell breaks loose again. they race the mile as
              before, percy hollering and stomping all the way, mousetraps
              snapping and flying up into frame as they go charging wildly
              past the cells.

              the mouse wins again. percy pauses, furious...and sees coffey
              staring at him from his cell.

                                  coffey
                        saw me a mouse go by.

              percy loses it, kicking and punching the restraint room door
              in a screaming rage as we

                                                       fade to:
