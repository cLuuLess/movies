              ext. georgia countryside - day (1935)

              hundreds of prisoners work the fields, pickaxes rising and
              falling in waves, a prison song being sung in cadence with
              the work. guards patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky.

              a late 20's ford prison truck comes chugging into view along
              the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat. it
              seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension.
