              int. e block access tunnel - night

              ...and they come down the steps. they realize coffey will
              have to stoop all the way down the tunnel. paul pats the
              gurney.

                                  paul
                        lie down on this.
                               (off coffey's look)
                        it'll be easier for you and no
                        harder for us.

              coffey eases carefully onto the gurney, lying on his back.
              his knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the ground,
              but it works. they push him along, traversing the pools of
              light.

              coffey actually starts to smile. he reaches out his arms,
              fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by.

                                  coffey
                        say. this is fun.
