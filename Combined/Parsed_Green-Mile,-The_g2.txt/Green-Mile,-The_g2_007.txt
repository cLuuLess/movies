              ext. nursing home - establishing - morning

              nestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling
              over the treetops.

              paul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed
              poncho. he looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply--
              this is a man who loves his walks.

              he pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to
              nibble as he presses up on the ridge...

              low angle: nursing home and ridge beyond

              ...and we see paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up
              toward the treeline. a pickup truck rumbles into frame and
              parks, a bumper sticker looming large: "i have seen god and
              his name is newt gingrich".

              brad dolan gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's,
              arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. he gazes
              up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly:

                                  brad
                        old fuck.

              he slams the door and heads for the nursing home...
