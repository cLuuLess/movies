              int. office/administration building - day

              a half dozen guards are waiting. we find bill dodge fixing
              the tie of a fat good ol' boy named earl.

                                  earl
                        been sweepin' floors here ten
                        years, never had to wear no damn
                        tie before.

                                  bill
                        you're a v.i.p. today, earl, so
                        just shut up.

              a knock at the door. everybody takes a seat. del is ushered
              in by brutal. del faces his audience, puts his hands to his
              chest in a "thank you" gesture worthy of lillie langtry
              before her adoring public, then announces grandly:

                                  del
                        messieurs et mesdames! bienvenue
                        au cirque de mousie!
