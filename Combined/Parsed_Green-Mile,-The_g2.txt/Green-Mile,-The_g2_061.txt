              int. del's cell - day

              paul is sitting with delacroix. brutal is leaning against the
              bars. del is throwing the spool. mr. jingles is fetching it.

              the silence is thick. just the clack-clatter of the spool,
              and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete. it's
              getting on paul's nerves in a big way. softly:

                                  paul
                        what about dean? he's got a little
                        boy would love a pet mouse, i bet.

              del looks horrified at the thought.

                                  del
                        how could a boy be trust wid mr.
                        jingles? maybe forget to feed him.
                        and how he keep up wid his
                        trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas?

              del tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter-skitter.

                                  paul
                        all right, i'll take him.

                                  del
                        t'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup,
                        but you live out in the woods, and
                        mr. jingles, he be scared to live
                        out dans la foret.

                                  paul
                        he whisper that in your ear?

              del nods, tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter
              skitter. paul is completely out of ideas. but then:

                                  brutal
                        how about mouseville?

                                  del
                        mouseville?

                                  brutal
                        tourist attraction down in
                        florida. tallahassee, i think. is
                        that right, paul? tallahassee?

                                  paul
                               (level)
                        yeah, that's right. tallahassee.
                        just down the road apiece from the
                        dog university.

              brutal's mouth twitches, but he manages to keep a straight
              face. he gives paul a look--don't blow this.

                                  brutal
                        you think they'd take mr. jingles?
                        you think he's got the stuff?

                                  paul
                        might. he's pretty smart.

                                  del
                        hey! what dis mouseville?

                                  brutal
                        tourist attraction, i said. they
                        got this big tent you go into--

                                  del
                        like a cirque? you have to pay?

                                  brutal
                        you shittin' me? course you pay.
                        dime a piece, two cents for the
                        kids. and inside the tent there's
                        this mouse city made out of boxes
                        and toilet paper rolls...

              percy is drifting up the block, listening too, but nobody's
              really paying him much mind.

                                  brutal
                        ...plus they got the mouseville
                        all-star circus. there's mice that
                        swing on trapeze, mice that roll
                        barrels, mice that stack coins...

                                  del
                        dat's it! dat's da place for mr.
                        jingles! you gonna be a circus
                        mouse after all! gonna live in a
                        mouse city down in florida!

              del tosses the spool extra hard--it takes a bad bounce off
              the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the mile.
              the mouse goes after it like a shot, too intent to notice:

              his old enemy percy.

                                  brutal
                        percy, no!

              percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on mr.
              jingles. there's a soft snap as the mouse's back breaks.

              del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing
              the mouse's name. percy looks to brutal and paul, smiles.

                                  percy
                        knew i'd get him sooner or later.
                        just a matter of time, really.

              he turns and strolls up the mile, leaving mr. jingles dying
              in a tiny pool of blood. up at the duty desk, dean and harry
              get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious.

              percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. del is
              still screaming, all his pent-up terror and grief pouring out
              at the dying mouse. and then comes a soft, urgent voice:

                                  coffey
                        give'm to me.

              they turn. coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one
              massive hand spread open.

                                  coffey
                        give'm to me. might still be time.

              paul hesitates, scoops the mouse up off the floor, wincing at
              the feel of it. splintered bones are poking at the hide.

                                  brutal
                        what are you doing?

              paul doesn't answer, just lays mr. jingles into coffey's
              hand. coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his
              other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. all we see
              now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly.

                                  brutal
                        paul, what the hell--

              paul motions him quiet. del is pleading softly at his bars:

                                  del
                        please, john. oh johnny, help him,
                        please help him, s'il vous plait.

              harry and dean join the group. everybody watching now.

              coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands, inhales sharply.
              the world hangs suspended for a moment. coffey raises his
              face, contorting as if desperately ill, starts making those
              horrendous choking sounds in his throat...

                                  brutal
                               (softly)
                        oh, dear jesus. the tail. look at
                        the tail.

              they do. the tail is no longer weak and dying. it's snapping
              briskly back and forth, as if ready to play.

              coffey makes that retching/gagging sound...and again exhales
              a cloud of swirling black "insects" from his nose and mouth.
              the men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and
              disappear.

              coffey bends down, opens his hand. mr. jingles bounds off his
              fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. they
              turn to see del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying.
              dean turns back to coffey with a stunned whisper:

                                  dean
                        what did you do?

                                  coffey
                        i helped del's mouse. he a circus
                        mouse. goan live in a mouse city
                        down in...down in...

                                  brutal
                               (numb)
                        florida?

              coffey nods, remembering.

                                  coffey
                        boss percy's bad. he mean. he step
                        on del's mouse.
                               (softly)
                        i took it back, though.

              and with that, he lies back on his bunk and faces the wall.
              the others look to paul, don't even know what to say.

                                  paul
                        brute, come along with me.
                               (to harry and dean)
                        you fellas go on back to you
                        cribbage game.

              harry nods numbly. paul leads brutal up the mile...

              execution chamber

              ...and they enter to find percy polishing old sparky's arms.

                                  percy
                        don't start in on me. it was just
                        a mouse. never belonged here in
                        the first place.

                                  paul
                        the mouse is fine. just fine.
                        you're no better at mouse-killing
                        than anything else around here.

                                  percy
                        you expect me to believe that? i
                        heard the goddamn thing crunch.

              paul steps closer, angry as we've ever seen him:

                                  paul
                        aren't you glad mr. jingles is
                        okay? after all our talks about
                        how we should keep the prisoners
                        calm? aren't you relieved?

                                  percy
                        what kind of game is this?

                                  paul
                        no game. see for yourself.

              beat. percy stalks past them, heads out onto the mile. paul
              and brutal just wait, saying nothing. brutal picks up the rag
              left by percy, resumes polishing chores on old sparky. paul
              stretches, cracks his neck. the silence heavy...

              ...until percy reappears.

                                  percy
                        you switched them! you switched
                        them somehow, you bastards!

                                  brutal
                        i always keep a spare mouse in my
                        wallet for occasions such as this.

                                  percy
                        you're playing with me, the both
                        of you! just who the hell do you
                        think you are--

              brutal grabs him , slams him bodily into the electric chair.
              paul bends close, gets right in percy's face.

                                  paul
                        we're the people you work with,
                        percy, but not for long. i want
                        your word.

                                  percy
                        my word?

                                  paul
                        i put you out front for del, you
                        put in your transfer to briar
                        ridge the very next day.

                                  percy
                        what if i just call up certain
                        people and tell them you're
                        harassing me? bullying me?

                                  paul
                        go ahead. i promise you'll leave
                        your share of blood on the floor.

                                  percy
                        over a mouse? you think anyone's
                        gonna give two shits?

                                  paul
                        no. but four men will swear you
                        stood by while wild bill tried to
                        strangle dean to death. about that
                        people will care, percy. even your
                        uncle the governor will care.

                                  brutal
                        thing like that goes in your work
                        record. work record can follow a
                        man around a long, long time.

              percy looks from one man to another, knowing he's trapped.

                                  paul
                        i put you out front, you put in
                        your transfer. that's the deal.

              percy thinks it over, nods. he tries to get up, but paul keep
              him pinned...and pointedly offer his hand.

                                  paul
                        you make a promise to a man, you
                        shake his hand.

              percy hesitates, shakes paul's hand...

              high wide angle of execution chamber

              ...and paul pulls him out of the electric chair as we

                                                       dissolve to:

              same angle as above - next night

              witnesses are trickling in, filling the seats. a storm is
              brewing, sending flashes of lightning across the floors.
