              ext. house in tefton - back porch - day

              burt hammersmith, public defender for trapingus county, sits
              with a cold soda and a magazine, watching his two children
              playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard. the screen
              door opens and cynthia hammersmith ushers paul out.

                                  cynthia
                        i offer you a cold drink?

                                  paul
                        yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be
                        fine. thank you.

              she goes back inside. burt rises.

                                  paul
                        mr. hammersmith. your office said
                        i'd find you at home today. i hope
                        i'm not troubling you.

                                  burt
                        that depends, mr.--?

                                  paul
                        paul edgecomb. i'm the e block
                        superintendant at cold mountain.

                                  burt
                        the green mile. i've heard of it.
                        lost a few clients your way.

                                  paul
                        that's why i'm here. i'd like to
                        ask you about one of them.

              burt settles back down, motions "please sit".

                                  burt
                        which client? now you got my
                        curiosity aroused.

                                  paul
                        john coffey.

                                  burt
                        ah, coffey. he causing you
                        problems?

                                  paul
                        no, can't say he is. he doesn't
                        like the dark. he cries on
                        occasion. other than that...

                                  burt
                        cries, does he? well, he's got a
                        lot to cry about, i'd say. you
                        know what he did.

                                  paul
                               (nods)
                        i read the court transcripts.

              cynthia reappears, hands paul a cold root beer.

                                  paul
                        thank you, missus.

                                  cynthia
                        my pleasure. kids! lunch is about
                        ready! y'all come on up!

              she goes back inside, but the kids aren't quite able to tear
              themselves away from their play.

                                  burt
                        what exactly are you trying to
                        find out? satisfy my curiosity,
                        i'll see if i can satisfy yours.

                                  paul
                        i've wondered if he ever did
                        anything like that before.

                                  burt
                        why? has he said anything?

                                  paul
                        no. but a man who does a thing
                        like that has often developed a
                        taste for it over time. occurred
                        to me it might be easy enough to
                        follow his backtrail and find out.
                        a man his size, and colored to
                        boot, can't be that hard to trace.

                                  burt
                        you'd think so, but you'd be
                        wrong. believe me, we tried. it's
                        like he dropped out of the sky.

                                  paul
                        how do you explain that?

                                  burt
                        we're in a depression. a third of
                        the country's out of work.

                        people are drifting by the
                        thousands, looking for work,
                        looking for that greener grass.
                        even a giant like coffey wouldn't
                        get noticed everywhere he goes...
                        not until he kills a couple of
                        little girls.

                                  paul
                        he's...strange, i admit. but there
                        doesn't seem to be any real
                        violence in him. i know violent
                        men, mr. hammersmith. i deal with
                        'em day in and day out.

              burt smiles, realizing:

                                  burt
                        you didn't come up here to ask me
                        whether he might have killed
                        before. you came up here to see if
                        i think he did it at all. that's
                        it, isn't it?

                                  paul
                        do you?

                                  burt
                        one seldom sees a less ambiguous
                        case. he was found with the
                        victims in his arms. blurted out
                        a confession right then and there.

                                  paul
                        yet you defended him.

                                  burt
                        everyone is entitled to a defense.

              cynthia hollers from an open window:

                                  cynthia
                        kids! lunch!

                                  burt
                        y'all listen to your momma, now!

              the kids start this way. burt turns back to paul.

                                  burt
                        tell you something. you listen
                        close, too, because it might be
                        something you need to know.

                                  paul
                        i'm listening.

                                  burt
                        we had us a dog. no particular
                        breed, but gentle. ready to lick
                        your hand or fetch a stick. just
                        a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.
                               (paul nods)
                        in many way, a good mongrel dog is
                        like you negro. you get to know
                        it, and often you get to love it.
                        it is of no particular use, but
                        you keep it around because you
                        think it loves you. if you're
                        lucky, mr. edgecomb, you never
                        have to find out any different. my
                        wife and i were not so lucky.
                        caleb. come here for a second.

              the little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. burt tires
              to raise the boy's chin. the boy resists for a moment...

                                  burt
                        please, son.

              ...and then his face comes around. he's horribly scarred on
              that side, the eye missing.

                                  burt
                        he has the one eye. i suppose he's
                        lucky not to be blind. we get down
                        on our knees and thank god for
                        that much at least. right caleb?
                               (the boy nods shyly)
                        okay, go on in now.

              the boy races inside after his sister. paul follows burt's
              gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied
              doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.

                                  burt
                        that dog attacked my boy for no
                        reason. just got it into his mind
                        one day. same with john coffey. he
                        was sorry afterwards, of that i
                        have no doubt...but those little
                        girls stayed raped and murdered
                        nonetheless. maybe he's never done
                        it before--my dog never bit
                        before, but i didn't concern
                        myself with that. i went out there
                        with my rifle and grabbed his
                        collar and blew his brains out.

                                  paul
                        i'm sorry for your trouble.

              burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.

                                  burt
                        i'm as enlightened as the next
                        man, mr. edgecomb. i would not
                        bring back slavery for all the tea
                        in china. i believe we have to be
                        humane and generous in our efforts
                        to solve the race problem. but we
                        have to remember that the negro
                        will bite if he gets the chance,
                        just like a mongrel dog will bite
                        if it crosses its mind to do so.
                               (beat)
                        is coffey guilty? yes, he is.
                        don't you doubt it, and don't you
                        turn your back on him. you might
                        get away with it once or even a
                        hundred times...but in the end...

              he raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.

                                  burt
                        you understand?

              paul says nothing. burt gazes out again. softly:

                                  burt
                        i'm gonna have to tear that old
                        doghouse down one of these days.

                                                       cut to:
