              int. detterick house - dawn (flashback)

              ...plunging us back into the screaming chaos: klaus grabbing
              up shotgun shells, howie loading the .22 rifle he got for
              christmas, marjorie sobbing incoherently...

                                  klaus
                        goddamn it, woman, get on the
                        phone now! you tell 'em we headed
                        west! mind what i'm saying! west,
                        y'hear?

              ...and she goes stumbling through the house, grabbing for the
              phone as her men disappear toward the porch b.g.:

                                  marjorie
                        central! central, are you on the
                        line? oh, god, please, somebody
                        took my little girls...

              outside the house

              klaus and his son race from the house, following spatters of
              blood across the yard...

              paul on the bleachers

              ...as paul lets out a long breath, turns the page...
