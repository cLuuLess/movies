              int. e block - day

              harry is walking the mile, doing a cell check and jotting on
              a clipboard. he pauses, making a notation...

              ...and a long stream of piss hits his leg. billy's at his
              bars, peeing on him. harry jumps back, stunned. billy howls
              with laughter, hosing his aim wildly from side to side.

                                  billy
                        yeehaaw! good shot, weren't it?
                        oh, the look on your face!

              paul and brutal come running. harry's just flabbergasted:

                                  harry
                        you believe this? son of a bitch
                        pissed on me!

                                  billy
                        hey, d'jall like that? i'm
                        currently cooking some turds t'go
                        with it! nice soft ones! i'll have
                        'em out t'yall tomorrow!

              paul stays calm, turns to brutal, nods at the restraint room.

                                  paul
                        we've been looking to clear that
                        room out anyway.

                                                       timecut:

              a stream of guards comes toting the last of the restraint
              room stuff past billy's cell while he heckles them from the
              bars...

                                  billy
                        hey! whassit now, movin' day?
                        y'all wanna come in and dust a
                        little? y'can shine my knob for me
                        while yer at it!

              ...and he pauses as paul and brutal step to the bars. paul
              has a canvas straitjacket. brutal pulls his nightstick.

                                  billy
                        you can come in here on your legs,
                        but you'll go out on your backs,
                        billy the kid guarantee ya that.
                               (motions to brutal)
                        c'mon, fuckstick. no sneakin' up
                        on me this time. we'll go man to
                        man, see who's the better fel--

              brutal unlocks the cell--and sidesteps, revealing harry
              pointing a fire hose. the hose erupts, driving billy across
              the cell with bone-jarring force. they batter him half-
              senseless, then cut the water. billy collapses in a heap.

              paul and brutal drag him semi-conscious from his cell and get
              the straitjacket on him. he comes around as they draw the
              straps tight and pull him to his feet.

                                  paul
                        c'mon, wild bill. little walky
                        walky.

                                  billy
                        don't you call me that! wild bill
                        hickock wasn't no range rider! he
                        was just a bushwackin' john law!
                        dumb sonovabitch sat with his back
                        to the door and kilt by a drunk!

                                  brutal
                        oh, my suds and body! a history
                        lesson! you just never know what
                        you're gonna get when you come to
                        work everyday on the green mile.
                        thank you, wild bill.

              billy lets out a scream of rage and throws himself at brutal.
              brutal, bored, shoves him back toward paul, who then propels
              him down the mile toward the open restraint room door. billy
              sees where they intend to put him, resorts to pleading:

                                  billy
                        oh, not in there! c'mon now, i'll
                        be good! honest injun i will! no!
                        no! ummmmhhhh...urg...ah!

              he suddenly drops to the floor, bucking and jerking wildly,
              spewing drool. harry's eyes go wide.

                                  harry
                        holy christ, he's pitchin' a fit!

              paul reaches down and unceremoniously starts dragging billy
              kicking and writhing the rest of the way.

                                  paul
                        he'll be fine, boys. trust me on
                        this one.

              brutal helps paul toss billy headlong into the padded room.
              they slam the door...

              restraint room

              ...and billy staggers to his feet in the straitjacket,
              inarticulate with rage, starts throwing himself against the
              door, screaming at the top of his lungs.

                                  billy
                        all i wanted me was a little
                        cornbread, you mutherfuckers!
