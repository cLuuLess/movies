              ext. nursing home - day

              paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. he
              reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from
              behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. he whirls, gasping in
              fright--it's brad dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.

                                  brad
                        out for a little stroll, paulie?

                                  paul
                        let go...

              paul tries to pull away, but dolan's got him tight.

                                  brad
                        what's with this poncho you got
                        on, huh? this isn't yours.

                                  paul
                        i got it off the wall there.
                        there's a whole row of them.

                                  brad
                        but not for you, paulie, that's
                        the thing. those are for the staff.

                                  paul
                        i just borrowed it. don't see what
                        harm it does.

                                  brad
                        it's not about harm, it's about
                        rules. you probably don't think an
                        old fart like you has to mind
                        rules anymore, but that's just not
                        true.

              brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing
              the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.

                                  paul
                        i'm sorry if i broke the rules.

                                  brad
                        you got no business up in those
                        woods anyway, especially in the
                        rain. what if you fall and bust a
                        hip, huh? who you think's gonna
                        have to hoss your sorry old bacon
                        back down here? me, that's who.

                                  paul
                        you're hurting me!

                                  brad
                        what do you do up there, anyway?
                        you're too old to go jerk off, so
                        what do you do?

                                  paul
                        nothing. i just walk, that's all,
                        i like to walk!

              brad lashes out and grabs paul's other hand, which he's been
              holding tightly clenched shut.

                                  brad
                        come on. open up. let poppa see.

              paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of
              a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.

                                  elaine (o.s.)
                        paul?

              they turn. elaine stands just inside the screen door with a
              cup of tea. brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much
              she's seen. elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:

                                  elaine
                        i saw you coming back, thought
                        you'd like some tea.
                               (beat)
                        are you coming in?

                                  paul
                        mr. dolan and i were...chatting.
                        about the weather. i think we're
                        through now.

              brad lets paul loose, leans close:

                                  brad
                        paulie? you tell anyone i squeezed
                        your po' ol' hand, i'll tell 'em
                        you're having senile delusions.
                        who you think they'll believe?

              brad walks off. paul turns, watches him go. the screen door
              opens and elaine steps out, her face pale. paul gives her a
              strained, though grateful, smile as we

                                                       cut to:
