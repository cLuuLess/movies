              paul stands at the graveside as the casket is lowered.

                                  paul (v.o.)
                        i'll die eventually, i imagine. i
                        have no illusions of immortality.
                        but i will have wished for death
                        long before death finds me.

              he turns and walks away.

                                  paul (v.o.)
                        in truth, i wish for it already.
