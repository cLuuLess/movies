              int. e block - night

              coffey sits quietly in his cell, a solitary firefly flitting
              in circles around his finger. paul and the men appear. the
              firefly flits away, vanishing through coffey's tiny window.

                                  coffey
                        hello, boss.

                                  paul
                        hello, john.

              brutal unlocks his cell. paul enters.

                                  paul
                        i guess you know we're coming down
                        to it now. another couple of days.
                               (beat)
                        is there anything special you'd
                        like for dinner that night? we can
                        rustle you up most anything.

              coffey gives it some careful thought.

                                  coffey
                        meatloaf be nice. mashed taters
                        with gravy. okra, maybe. i's not
                        picky.

                                  paul
                        what about a preacher? someone you
                        could say a little prayer with?

                                  coffey
                        don't want no preacher. you can
                        say a prayer, if you want. i could
                        get kneebound with you, i guess.

                                  paul
                        me?

              coffey gives him a look--please.

                                  paul
                        s'pose i could, if it came to that.

              paul sits, working himself up to it:

                                  paul
                        john, i have to ask you something
                        very important right now.

                                  coffey
                        i know what you gonna say. you
                        don' have to say it.

                                  paul
                        i do. i do have to.
                               (beat)
                        john, tell me what you want me to
                        do. you want me to take you out of
                        here? just let you run away? see
                        how far you can get?

                                  coffey
                        why would you do such a foolish
                        thing?

              paul hesitates, emotions swirling, trying to find the right
              words.

                                  paul
                        on the day of my judgement, when
                        i stand before god, and he asks me
                        why did i kill one of his true
                        miracles, what am i gonna say?
                        that is was my job? my job?

                                  coffey
                        you tell god the father it was a
                        kindness you done.
                               (takes his hand)
                        i know you hurtin' and worryin',
                        i can feel it on you, but you
                        oughtta quit on it now. because i
                        want it over and done. i do.

              coffey hesitates--now he's the one trying to find the right
              words, trying to make paul understand:

                                  coffey
                        i'm tired, boss. tired of bein' on
                        the road, lonely as a sparrow in
                        the rain. tired of not ever having
                        me a buddy to be with, or tell me
                        where we's coming from or going
                        to, or why. mostly i'm tired of
                        people being ugly to each other.

                        i'm tired of all the pain i feel
                        and hear in the world ever' day.
                        there's too much of it. it's like
                        pieces of glass in my head all the
                        time. can you understand?

              by now, paul is blinking back tears. softly:

                                  paul
                        yes, john. i think i can.

                                  brutal
                        there must be something we can do
                        for you, john. there must be
                        something you want.

              coffey thinks about this long and hard, finally looks up.

                                  coffey
                        i ain't never seen me a flicker
                        show.

                                                       cut to:

              tight on coffey's face

              gazing with wide-eyed, open-mouthed wonder, the light of a
              motion picture projector flickering on his skin...

              int  prison auditorium - night

              ...while fred astaire and ginger rogers dance up there on the
              big screen, images flowing in magical black and silver tone.

                                  fred astaire
                               (singing)
                        heaven, i'm in heaven...and my
                        heart beats so that i can hardly
                        speak...

              paul and the men are scattered about in the otherwise empty
              auditorium, also watching.

              projection booth

              toot operates the projector, peering through the tiny window
              into the theater. he yawns, glances at his watch. late.

              in the auditorium

              fred and ginger are now in the most passionate and graceful
              part of the dance. irving berlin's music swells.

              coffey

              can't believe what he's seeing. he's so excited his breath is
              caught in his throat. softly:

                                  coffey
                        why, they's angels. angels. just
                        like up in heaven...

                                                       dissolve to:
