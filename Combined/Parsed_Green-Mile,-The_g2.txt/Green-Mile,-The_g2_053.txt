              int. e block - day

              ...and he walks onto the mile with a bundle wrapped in a dish
              towel. brutal glances up from the desk, sniffing the air.

                                  paul
                        no, it's not for you.

              paul continues down the mile. whatever he's carrying, the
              smell of it brings del to his bars. even mr.jingles comes
              skittering out of his cigar box, sniffing.

                                  del
                        oh. oh my.

              paul arrives at coffey's cell. coffey's on his bunk facing
              the wall. his head comes around, drawn by the aroma. he sits
              up, wipes the tears leaking from his eyes, looks at paul.

                                  coffey
                        i'm smelling me some cornbread.

              paul speaks softly so the others can't hear:

                                  paul
                        it's from my missus. she wanted to
                        thank you.

              coffey nods thoughtfully, absorbing this notion. then:

                                  coffey
                        thank me for what?

                                  paul
                        you know. for helping me.

                                  coffey
                        helping you with what?

              paul motions discreetly to his crotch.

                                  coffey
                        ohhh.
                               (beat)
                        was your missus pleased?

                                  paul
                        several times.

              paul hands him the bundle through the bars. coffey takes it,
              uncovers the cornbread reverently, gazes back up.

                                  coffey
                        this all for me?

              paul nods. across the way, del is pressing his face longingly
              through the bars while mr. jingles crawls on his shoulder.

                                  del
                        oh my. john, i can smell it from
                        here. i surely can.

                                  coffey
                               (looks to paul)
                        can i give some to del?

                                  paul
                        it's yours, john. you do with it
                        as you please.

              john carefully scoops a big chunk of cornbread out with his
              enormous hand, holds it through the bars to paul.

                                  coffey
                        here's for del and mr. jingles
                        then.

                                  billy
                        hey! what about me? i'm'a get some
                        too, ain't i

              coffey looks to paul--do i have to?

                                  paul
                        it's yours, john. as you please.

                                  coffey
                        well. fine. i think i'll keep the
                        rest, then.

              he smiles like a big kid, digging in with his fingers. paul
              crosses the mile to del's cell, hands him his share.

                                  paul
                        courtesy of the gentleman across
                        the way.

                                  del
                        oh, john. so very fine of you. so
                        very kind. mr. jingles t'ank you.

                                  coffey
                               (mouth full)
                        ...wel'cm...

                                  billy
                        hey! what about me? don't you hold
                        out on me, ya big dummy nigger!

              paul's temper flares--he steps to billy's cell.

                                  paul
                        you'll keep a civil tongue on my
                        block.

              beat. billy spits in paul's face and follows it up with a big
              grin--what are you gonna do about that? paul is seething as
              he wipes the spit off, but keeps his temper where it belongs.

                                  paul
                        you get that one for free. but
                        that's the last one.

              paul walks away. billy laughs, hollering after him:

                                  billy
                        that's it? just that little bitty
                        one? guess i'll have to pay out
                        for the rest, huh?

                                                       dissolve to:
