              int. breakfast room - morning

              dozens of retirees are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee
              or tea. some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their
              own company, some just stare slackly into space.

              paul enters, sees elaine connelly sitting with a few other
              ladies, sipping tea. she's 80, refined and elegant, his best
              friend here. she gives him a good-morning smile. he gives her
              a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more.

              paul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two
              pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate. he tosses
              elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits.
