              int. access tunnel - night

              paul and the others bring the stretcher down, lay the corpse
              on the gurney. percy starts stammering excuses:

                                  percy
                        i didn't know the sponge was
                        supposed to be wet--

              brutal hauls off and slugs him. a scuffle ensues as the
              others grab brutal and pull him off.

                                  paul
                        brutal, no!

                                  brutal
                        what do you mean, no? how can you
                        say no? you saw what he did!

                                  paul
                        delacroix's dead, nothing can
                        change that, and percy's not worth
                        it!

                                  brutal
                        so he just gets away with it? is
                        that how it works?

              hal comes lunging down the stairs, furious:

                                  hal
                        what the fuck was that? jesus
                        christ, three witnesses puked all
                        over the floor up there! and the
                        smell! i got van hay to open both
                        doors, but that smell won't come
                        out for five damn years, that's
                        what i'm betting! and that asshole
                        wharton is singing about it! i can
                        hear him!

                                  paul
                               (quietly)
                        can he carry a tune, hal?

              this pulls the plug on the moment--hal snorts, triggering
              laughter among the men, a wild release of tension and fear.
              everybody starts feeling a bit saner again as it dies down:

                                  hal
                        okay, boys. okay. now what the
                        hell happened?

              all eyes go to percy. hal turns, sees percy's bloody lip.

                                  hal
                        percy? something to say?

                                  percy
                        i didn't know the sponge was
                        supposed to be wet.

              beat. a look of utter contempt from hal.

                                  hal
                        how many years you spend pissing
                        on the toilet seat before somebody
                        told you to put it up?

                                  paul
                        percy fucked up, hal. pure and
                        simple.

                                  hal
                        is that your official position?

                                  paul
                        don't you think it should be?

              hal considers it, nods.

                                  paul
                        he'll be putting in a transfer
                        request to briar ridge tomorrow.
                        moving on to bigger and better
                        things. isn't that right, percy?

              percy nods. hal steps close, gives him a tight, icy smile.

                                  hal
                        you're a little asshole, and i
                        don't like you a bit.
                               (off percy's look)
                        have that transfer request on my
                        desk first thing.

              hal heads back up the stairs. brutal shoves percy aside and
              wheels delacroix's body down the tunnel.
