              int. shack - day

              we see paul approach through the grimy window as before, this
              time bringing elaine. angle shifts to the door as they
              arrive, creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them.

              they enter. elaine looks around at the musty nooks and
              crannies, wondering what they're doing here. paul touchers
              arm, directs her attention:

                                  paul
                        there.

              elaine moves closer, sees it on the dusty floorboards:

              an old cigar box.

              for a moment, she doesn't know what to make of it.

                                  paul
                        hey. wake up, old boy. wake up.

              elaine's breath catches in her throat...

              ...as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the
              cigar box. it's a mouse. his fur, once brown, is now all gray.

                                  elaine
                        paul? it isn't...it can't be...

              paul gets down on the floor, holds out his hand.

                                  paul
                        come over here, boy. come on over
                        her and see this lady.

              the mouse tries several times to get over the side of the
              cigar box before he finally makes it. he comes to them,
              hobbling and crippled with arthritis. paul pulls a slice of
              toast from his pocket, breaks off a small piece for the mouse.

                                  elaine
                        that can't be mr. jingles.

              paul says nothing, just pulls a spool from his pocket. mr.
              jingles might be old, but he's as obsessed as ever. he gets
              ready to fetch, eyes riveted to the spool. softly:

                                  paul
                        messieurs et mesdames. beinvenue
                        au cirque du mousie.

              paul tosses the spool. the mouse limps painfully after it. he
              reaches it, goes around...and has to lay down to catch his
              breath. elaine starts forward, but paul holds her back.

              after a moment, mr. jingles finds his feet again. he rises
              and starts nosing the spool back to paul.

                                  elaine
                        oh, paul. don't make him do it
                        again. i can't bear to watch.

                                  paul
                               (softly)
                        but he loves it so much.

              he glances around at the shack with a sad smile.

                                  paul
                        this isn't exactly the mouseville
                        we had in mind...but we make do,
                        don't we, old fella?

                                  brad (o.s.)
                        as i live and breathe!

              they gasp and spin. brad dolan stands in the doorway.

                                  brad
                        fooled you, didn't i got yourself
                        a little love nest here, i see...

              he pauses, seeing mr. jingles.

                                  brad
                        ...what the fuck? is that a mouse?

                                  paul
                        don't hurt him, okay? okay?

                                  brad
                        it's a goddamn mouse, y'old fool,
                        they carry all kind'a disease...

              brad grabs an old garden hoe--the blade's rusted, but still
              sharp enough to cut a mouse in two.

                                  brad
                        ...now step aside.

              paul rushes in front of brad, fists clenched, yelling:

                                  paul
                        you leave him alone, percy! you
                        leave him alone, or by god i'll--

              brad gives paul a hard shove, pins him against the wall.

                                  brad
                        who you calling percy? name's
                        brad, you senile fucker. and i'm
                        gonna nail that mouse, you can
                        take that to the everfucking bank.

              elaine is suddenly at brad's elbow, seething with fury:

                                  elaine
                        how dare you? get out!

                                  brad
                        piss off, you wrinkeldy old bitch.
                        me and paulie are talking.

                                  elaine
                        his name is mr. edgecomb. if you
                        ever call him paulie again, your
                        days of employment at georgia
                        pines will end.

                                  brad
                        who the hell you think you are?

                                  elaine
                        i am the grandmother of the man
                        who is currently speaker of the
                        georgia house of representatives.
                        a man who loves his relatives, mr.
                        dolan. all it would take is a
                        phone call.

              brad's smile falters. elaine steps closer.

                                  elaine
                        at first i thought i'd let you be.
                        i'm old, and that seemed easiest.
                        but when my friends are threatened
                        and abused, i do not let it be.
                               (icy beat)
                        now get out, or you won't work
                        another day here. not another
                        hour. i swear it.

              brad eases his grip on paul...and backs off.

                                  brad
                        don't know what you're getting so
                        het up about. just a damn mouse.

                                  elaine
                        get out, you ignorant man. what
                        little mind you have is ugly and
                        misdirected.

              brad flushes red, heads for the door. he pauses.

                                  brad
                        don't bother coming back here
                        tomorrow...mr. edgecomb gonna be
                        a new lock on this door. this is
                        off-limits to residents, no matter
                        what mrs. my shit don't stink has
                        to say about it.

              and off he goes. paul tries to control the shaking in his
              hands, looks to elaine.

                                  elaine
                        little trick i learned from percy
                        wetmore.

                                  paul
                        is your grandson really speaker of
                        the house?

                                  elaine
                        he is.

              paul bends down, picks mr. jingles up.

                                  paul
                        you gonna thank the lady? she just
                        saved your old mousie hide.

              the mouse stretches his neck forward, nose twitching,
              smelling paul's breath. paul looks to elaine. softly:

                                  paul
                        i think mr. jingles happened by
                        accident. i think when we
                        electrocuted del, and it all went
                        so badly...well, john could feel
                        it, you know...and i think a tiny
                        part of whatever was inside of him
                        just leapt out...
                               (beat)
                        me, i was no accident. john had to
                        give me a little part of
                        himself...a gift, like...so i
                        could see for myself what wild
                        bill had done. when john did that,
                        a part of whatever power worked
                        through him spilled into me.

                                  elaine
                        he...what? infected you with life?

              paul looks at the mouse, strokes him gently between the ears.

                                  paul
                        that's as good a word as any. he
                        infected us both, didn't he, mr.
                        jingles. with life.
                               (beat)
                        i'm a hundred and five years old,
                        elaine. i was forty the year john
                        coffey walked the green mile.

                                  elaine
                        ...oh my god...

              camera pushes slowly in on paul as:

                                  paul
                        i haven't even had a cold since
                        1935. i've had to watch my friends
                        and loved ones die off through the
                        years...hal and melinda...brutus
                        howell...my wife...my son...
                               (beat)
                        ...and you, elaine. you'd die,
                        too, and my curse is knowing i'll
                        be there to see it...

                                                       dissolve to:
