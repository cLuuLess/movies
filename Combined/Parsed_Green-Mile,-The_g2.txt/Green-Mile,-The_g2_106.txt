              int. paul's bedroom - night

              paul lies awake, staring at the moon outside his window.

                                  paul (v.o.)
                        i think about all the people i've
                        loved, now long gone.

                        i think about my beautiful jan,
                        and how i lost her so many years
                        ago. i think about all of us
                        walking our own green mile, each
                        in our own time. but one thought,
                        more than any other, keeps me

                        so long, how much longer do i have?

              he looks over at the nightstand...

                        we each owe a death, there are no
                        exceptions, but sometimes, oh god,
                        the green mile is so long...

              ...and we pan to reveal mr. jingles sleeping fitfully in his
              cigar box, chasing that spool in his dreams as we

                                                       fade out:
