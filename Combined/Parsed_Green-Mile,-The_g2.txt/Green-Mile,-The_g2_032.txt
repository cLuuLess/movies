              int. execution chamber - night

              the sponge is pulled sopping wet from the bucket of brine,
              dripping a trail of water across the floor. brutal places it
              atop bitterbuck's head. water courses down the sides of the
              condemned man's mask and neck, pooling on the floor.

              the cap is lowered, the straps secured. all we hear now is
              the sound of bitterbuck's breathing growing louder and faster
              under the mask...until, softly:

                                  brutal
                        roll on two.

              wham! the switch is thrown. bitterbuck surges forward against
              the straps, riding the powerful current.

              some witnesses turn away. paul and brutal maintain grim eye
              contact with each other, waiting.

              behind the partition, percy watches through the mesh with
              gleaming eyes, wishing he could see better.

              van hay kills the current. bitterbuck goes limp. a doctor
              steps forward, checks for a heartbeat, shakes his head.

                                  brutal
                        again.

              the switch is thrown a second time. bitterbuck surges forward
              again, riding the current all the way...

                                                       cut to:
