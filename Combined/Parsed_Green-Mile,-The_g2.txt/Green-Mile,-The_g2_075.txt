              int. e block - night

              harry and dean are playing cards at the duty desk, tension
              thick, cards slapping softly as the seconds tick by. paul and
              brutal finally show up toting bottles of rc cola:

                                  brutal
                        fellas thirsty? fresh out of the
                        icebox.

                                  dean
                        oh, thanks. that's swell.

                                  harry
                        yeah, hot in here.

              they begin popping the caps off, swigging cola. the sound of
              it brings billy to his bars.

                                  billy
                        hey. hey, i'm'a get some too.

                                  brutal
                        my ass you get some too.

                                  paul
                        you think you deserve any?

                                  harry
                               (checks a clipboard)
                        day report says he's been okay.

                                  billy
                        hell, yes, i been behaved. c'mon,
                        now, don't be stingy hogs.

              paul shrugs to brutal--why not? brutal pops the top off a
              bottle, passes it to paul. paul grabs a tin cup, sets it on
              the desk...and we see it contains the morphine powder. he
              pours the cola, swirls it around...

              angle through coffey's bars

              ...as coffey looks up, sensing something happening. he peers
              up the mile as paul walks to:

              billy's cell

              billy reaches for the cup, but paul keeps it out of reach.

                                  paul
                        you gonna stay behaved?

                                  billy
                        c'mon, you clunk, gimme that.

                                  paul
                        you promise me, or i'll drink it
                        myself right here in front of you.

                                  billy
                        c'mon now, don't be that way. i be
                        good.

              paul lets him take the cup. billy knocks it back, draining it
              in three huge swallows. he lets out an awesome belch.

                                  paul
                        cup.

                                  billy
                        we'll break out the fire hose and
                        take it anyway. and you will have
                        drunk your last r.c. cola. unless
                        they serve 'em down in hell.

              billy's smile fades. he hands the cup through the bars. paul
              takes it, turns and heads back to--

              the duty desk

              --where brutal, harry, and dean have been watching the entire
              exchange with their hearts in their throats...

                                                       dissolve:

              ...and we find billy staring glassy-eyed at the ceiling. he
              keels over on his bunk. angle to paul and brutal stepping to
              the bars with harry and dean.

                                  paul
                        anybody wants to back out, now's
                        the time. after this, there's no
                        turning back.
                               (off their looks)
                        so? we gonna do this?

              a voice comes softly from down the way:

                                  coffey
                        sure. i'd like to take a ride.

              their heads come slowly around, staring at coffey in shock.

                                  brutal
                               (to paul)
                        guess were all in.
