              int. e block - day

              paul and brutal appear at del's bars with harry and dean.

                                  paul
                        del, grab your things. big day for
                        you and mr. jingles.

                                  del
                        whatchoo talkin' bout?

                                  paul
                        important folks heard about your
                        mouse, wanna see him perform. not
                        just guards, either. one of them's
                        a politician all the way from the
                        state capital, i believe.

              del swells with pride upon hearing this. he scrounges up mr.
              jingles props, steps from his cell, looks to harry and dean.

                                  del
                        you fellas comin'?

                                  harry
                        we got other fish to fry just now,
                        del, but you knock 'em for a loop.

              del nods, beaming happily, looks to coffey in his cell.

                                  coffey
                        you knock 'em for a loop like mr.
                        harry says, del.

              brutal leads del up the mile, paul and the others at their
              heels. percy's at the duty desk. he smirks and rolls his eyes
              as del goes by. the moment brutal and del are out the door...

              ...toot emerges from paul's office where he's been hiding.

                                  paul
                        let's move along briskly, folks.
                        there's not much time.

              toot hurries down to take his place in del's cell.

                                  toot
                        i'm sittin' down, i'm sittin'
                        down, i'm sittin' down.
