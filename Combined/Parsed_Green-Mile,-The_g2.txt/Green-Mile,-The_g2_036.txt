              int. warden moores' office - day

              ...and enters to find hal staring out the window.

                                  paul
                        hal? you wanted to see me?

                                  hal
                        yeah. paul. close the door.

              hal's speech is halting, his thoughts disjointed and slow:

                                  hal
                        uh. so you know. you got a new
                        prisoner coming in tomorrow.
                        william wharton. young kid. wild
                        as hell, judging from this...

              he picks up the report, trying to focus his thoughts:

                                  hal
                        ...been rambling all over the
                        state last few years, causing all
                        kinds of trouble. finally hit big
                        time. killed three people in a
                        holdup, including a pregnant
                        woman. got "billy the kid"
                        tattooed on his left arm...bad
                        news all around...

              he trails off, no longer able to focus on the words. paul is
              shocked to see tears spill silently down his cheeks.

                                  paul
                        hal?

                                  hal
                        it's a tumor, paul. a brain tumor.

              paul doesn't know what to say. hal looks at him.

                                  hal
                        they got x-ray pictures of it.
                        it's the size of a lemon, they
                        said, and way down deep inside
                        where they can't operate. they say
                        she'll be dead by christmas. i
                        haven't told her. i can't think
                        how. for the life of me, paul, i
                        can't think how to tell my wife
                        she's going to die.

              hal moores, one of the toughest and steadiest men you'd ever
              meets, starts to cry. he dissolves into great big gasping
              sobs, losing all control.

                                                       cut to:
