              int. house - night

              ...and comes up the hallway toward the stairs.

                                  hal
                        don't you go up there! don't you
                        do it!

                                  coffey
                        boss, you just be quiet now and
                        let me be.

              coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels,
              heading up toward that quavering voice:

                                  melinda (o.s.)
                        stay out of here! whoever you are,
                        just stay out! i'm not dressed for
                        visitors, you rat's asshole!
