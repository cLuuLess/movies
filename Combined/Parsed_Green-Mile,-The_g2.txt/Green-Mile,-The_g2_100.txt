              ext. woods - day

              paul brings elaine along the wooded path into view of the
              storage shacks. they're both wearing ponchos.

                                  paul
                        there. it's in there.

                                  elaine
                        paul? this thing you want to show
                        me. is it scary?

                                  paul
                        scary? no. not really.

              he gives her a smile, offers his hand. she takes it.
