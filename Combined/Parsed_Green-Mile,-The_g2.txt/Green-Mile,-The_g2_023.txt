              int. paul's house - night

              paul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours of the morning,
              drinking buttermilk and listening to soft music on the radio.
              janice edgecomb appears, shuffling sleepily downstairs.

                                  jan
                        paul?

                                  paul
                        hey, you. music too loud?

                                  jan
                        no. there's just this big empty
                        spot in the bed where my husband
                        usually sleeps.

                                  paul
                        he said to tell you he's having a
                        little trouble with that tonight.

              she comes into the kitchen, strokes his hair. there's an easy
              familiarity and a deep love between these two.

                                  jan
                        worried about melinda and hal? is
                        that what's got you up?

                                  paul
                        yeah, that. things.

                                  jan
                        things.

              she sits on his lap and gives him a crooked smile--you're not
              getting off that easily.

                                  paul
                        got a new inmate today. big,
                        simple-minded fella.

                                  jan
                        do i want to hear what he did?

                                  paul
                        no. one sleepless member of this
                        family's enough.
                               (softly)
                        the things that happen in this
                        world. it's a wonder god allows it.

              she gives him a tiny kiss above his left eyebrow, in that
              special spot that makes him prickle.

                                  jan
                        why don't you come to bed? i've
                        got something to help you sleep,
                        and you can have all you want.

                                  paul
                        don't i wish. i've still got
                        something wrong with my
                        waterworks, i don't want to pass
                        it on.

                                  jan
                        you see doc sadler yet?

                                  paul
                        no, because he'll want me to take
                        sulfa tablets and i'll spend the
                        rest of the week puking in every
                        corner of my office. it'll run its
                        course all by itself, thank you
                        very much for your concern.

              she kisses that spot above his eyebrow again. he smiles.

                                  jan
                        poor old guy...

                                                       dissolve to:

              in tight angles: copper plugs are cleaned, switches are
              oiled, circuits are tested...
