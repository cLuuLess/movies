              ...and we see klaus detterick walk from his house to the barn
              with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening

              b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard...

              ...until a woman's scream shatters the silence. klaus
              reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house...
