              int. execution chamber - night

              coffey is brought in...and freezes in horror at the sight of
              old sparky. a whisper:

                                  coffey
                        they're still in there. pieces of
                        them, still in there. i hear them
                        screaming.

              all eyes go to the electric chair. it sits shrouded in shadow
              like an ominous throne. never before has this place felt so
              haunted to the men. it makes the hairs on the neck stand up.

                                  paul
                        john, come along! right now,
                        y'hear? c'mon! toward that door!

              coffey finally responds, pulling away...
