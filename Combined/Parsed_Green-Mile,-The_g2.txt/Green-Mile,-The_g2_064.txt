              int. e block - night

              paul returns to find wild bill making up a song in his cell:

                                  billy
                               (singing)
                        barbecue! me and you! stinky,
                        pinky, phew-phew-phew! weren't
                        billy or jilly or hilly or roy--it
                        was a french-fried faggot named
                        delacroix!

                                  paul
                        you're about ten seconds away from
                        spending the rest of your life in
                        the padded room.

              billy falls silent. paul continues down the mile to coffey's
              cell. coffey's on his bunk, face streaked with tears. he
              wipes his eyes with the heels of his hands like an exhausted
              child.

                                  coffey
                        poor del. poor old del.

                                  paul
                        yes. poor old del. john, are you
                        okay?

                                  coffey
                        i could feel it from here.

                                  paul
                        what do you mean? you could hear
                        it? is that what you mean?

                                  coffey
                        he's out of it now, though. he's
                        the lucky one. no matter how it
                        happened, del's the lucky one.

              paul realizes he won't get a coherent answer.

                                  paul
                        where's mr. jingles?

                                  coffey
                               (points vaguely)
                        ran down there. don't think he'll
                        be back.
                               (beat)
                        awful tired now, boss. dog tired.

              coffey lays down, turns to face the wall.

                                  paul
                        me too, john. me too.

                                                       cut to:
