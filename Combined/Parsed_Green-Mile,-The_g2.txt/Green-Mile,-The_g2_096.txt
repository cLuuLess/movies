              int. nursing home sunroom - present day

              it's late in the day as:

                                  paul
                        that was the last execution i ever
                        took part in. just couldn't do it
                        anymore after that. brutal either.
                        we both transferred out, took jobs
                        with boys' correctional.
                               (beat, nods)
                        that was all right. catch 'em
                        young, that became my motto. might
                        even have done some good.

              angle shifts to elaine listening. uncertain.

                                  paul
                        you don't believe me.

                                  elaine
                        i don't imagine you would lie to
                        me, paul. it's just that...

                                  paul
                        ...it's quite a story.

                                  elaine
                        yes. quite a story.
                               (pause)
                        one thing i don't understand. you
                        said you and jan had a grownup son
                        in 1935. is that right?
                               (paul nods)
                        but if that's true...

                                  paul
                        the math doesn't work, does it?

              she shakes her head. paul thinks for a moment, comes to a
              decision.

                                  paul
                        you feel up to a walk?

                                                       cut to:
