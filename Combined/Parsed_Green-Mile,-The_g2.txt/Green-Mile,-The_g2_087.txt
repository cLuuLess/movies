              int. e block - dawn

              ...as hal arrives, wearing his pajama top under his overcoat.
              he sees the police photographer taking pictures. the guards
              are giving statements to groups of cops, everybody murmuring:

                                  dean
                        ...well, i dunno, he just snapped,
                        i guess...

                                  harry
                        ...s'right, one minute he's fine,
                        the next--blammo...

                                  brutal
                        ...bastard grabbed him through the
                        bars a few days back, scared the
                        boy so bad he wet himself...

              hal turns, sees:

              percy

              sits handcuffed on the floor of the mile, eyes glassier than
              wild bill's. two cops are trying to snap him out of it:

                                  cop #1
                        son! son! can you hear me?

                                  cop #2
                        speak up if you can hear us! we
                        gotta ask you some questions!

              a medic is raising percy's eyelid with his thumb, shining a
              penlight, getting no reaction.

                                  medic
                        i think this boy's cheese slid off
                        his cracker.

              hal

              sees paul, motions him aside to talk privately:

                                  hal
                        i'll cover you as much as i can,
                        even if it mean my job, but i have
                        to know. does this have anything
                        to do with what happened at my
                        house? does it, paul?

              paul looks hal in the eye. as with bitterbuck, the lie comes
              easy:

                                  paul
                        no.

                                                       dissolve to:
