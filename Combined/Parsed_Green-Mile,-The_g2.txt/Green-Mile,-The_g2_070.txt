              int. paul's bedroom - night

              paul is wide awake, staring at the dark. jan can sense him
              brooding. she rolls over sleepily.

                                  jan
                        honey? if you don't say what's on
                        your mind, i'm afraid i'll have to
                        smother you with a pillow.

                                  paul
                        i'm thinking i love you. i'm
                        thinking i don't know what i'd do
                        if you were gone.

                                  jan
                        oh.

                               (beat)
                        i'm also thinking i'd like to have
                        the boys over tomorrow.
