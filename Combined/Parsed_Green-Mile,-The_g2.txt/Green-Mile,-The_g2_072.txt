              int. infirmary building/dispensary - night

              a flashlight beam plays across a glass cabinet, scanning the
              contents. the beam pauses. a hand enters frame, unlocks the
              cabinet, pulls out a bottle of morphine tablets...

              ...and we angle to brutal as he shakes half a dozen pills
              onto his palm, pockets them, replaces the bottle on the
              shelf. he turns and slips five bucks to a nightshift orderly.

                                  brutal
                        i was never here.

                                  orderly
                        shit, for five bucks, you was
                        never nowhere.
