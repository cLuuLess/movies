              int. paul's office - night

              percy looks up from his book as the door opens. paul enters
              with brutal and harry, ominously hemming the desk.

                                  percy
                        what is this?

              paul pulls the canvas straitjacket from behind his back.

                                  paul
                        payback.

              percy jumps up and tries to the execution chamber, but harry
              grabs him, spins him back. a wild scuffle ensues as:

                                  percy
                        let go of me! let go!

                                  paul
                        settle down, percy!

              percy tries to jerk away, crashes into the desk. the book he
              was reading falls to the floor--

              --and a "tijuana bible" is revealed within the pages. it's a
              pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's,
              featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or
              movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts. this one has
              olive oyl getting it doggy-style from popeye. the word
              balloon over his head features his famous laugh: "uk-uk-uk-
              uk!"

                                  brutal
                        oooo, poicy! what would your
                        mother say?

                                  percy
                        let go, you ignoramus! i know
                        people! big people!

                                  paul
                        so you've said. c'mon, stick out
                        your arms like a good boy.

                                  percy
                        i won't. and you can't make me.

                                  brutal
                        you're dead wrong about that, you
                        know.

              brutal grabs percy by the ears, twisting hard. percy lets out
              a shriek--not just of pain, but a dismayed understanding that
              he's not going to bluster his way out of this one.

                                  brutal
                        you gonna put your arms up? i'll
                        rip your ears off. use 'em for tea
                        caddies. you know i will.

                                  paul
                        the man's ripping your ears off,
                        percy. i'd do as he says.

              percy jerks his arms up before him. they get the straitjacket
              on him within seconds. percy turns to paul on the verge of
              tears. softly:

                                  percy
                        please, paul. don't put me in with
                        wild bill. please.

                                  paul
                        you would think that.

              paul gives him a hard, angry shove...
