              int. dining room- day

              brutal, harry, and dean are seated at the table with paul and
              jan. serving plates are being passes, everybody digging in:

                                  the men
                               (various, ad-lib)
                        ma'am, you sure know how to fry up
                        some fine chicken...brutal, don't
                        hog the taters now...try that corn
                        yet? it's something special...

              paul softly interjects:

                                  paul
                        you saw what he did with the mouse.

              this stops everybody cold. dean puts his chicken down, wipes
              his hands. looks are traded in the silence.

                                  brutal
                        i could'a gone the rest of the day
                        without you bringing that up.

                                  dean
                        i could'a gone the rest of the
                        year.

                                  paul
                        he did it to me too. he put his
                        hands on me and took my bladder
                        infection away.

              the men absorb this. brutal glances to jan.

                                  jan
                        when he came home, he was...all
                        better.

                                  dean
                        you're talking about an authentic
                        healing. a praise-jesus miracle.

                                  paul
                        i am.

                                  brutal
                        if you say it, i accept it. but
                        what's it got to do with us?

              jan looks to paul, realization starting to dawn:

                                  jan
                        melinda? oh, paul...

                                  brutal
                        melinda? melinda moores?

              paul nods--that's who we're talking about.

                                  jan
                        you really think you can help her?

                                  paul
                        it's not a bladder infection, or
                        even a busted-up mouse. but there
                        might be a chance.

                                  harry
                        hold on now. you're talking about
                        our jobs. sneak a sick woman onto
                        a cellblock?

                                  paul
                        hal would never allow that. you
                        know him, he wouldn't believe
                        something unless it fell on him.

                                  brutal
                        so you're talking about taking
                        john coffey to her. that's more
                        than just our jobs, paul.

                                  dean
                        damn right. that's prison time if
                        we get caught.

                                  harry
                        let's not discuss this like it's
                        even an option. brutal, help me
                        out here...

              brutal lets out a deep breath, considering. he looks to paul.

                                  brutal
                        i'm sure she's a fine woman...

                                  jan
                        the finest.

                                  paul
                        what's happening to her is an
                        offense, brutal. to the eyes and
                        the ears and the heart.

                                  brutal
                        i have no doubt. but we don't know
                        her like you and jan do...do we?

                                  paul
                        that's why it's a lot to ask.

                                  harry
                        it is. let's not forget coffey's
                        a murderer. what if he escapes?
                        i'd hate losing my job or going to
                        prison, but i'd hate having a dead
                        child on my conscience even more.

                                  paul
                        i don't think that'll happen...
                               (beat, softly)
                        ...in fact, i don't think he did
                        it at all.

              the men are stunned by this. off their looks:

                                  paul
                        i just can't see god putting a
                        gift like that in the hands of a
                        man who would kill a child.

                                  dean
                        well, that's a tender notion, but
                        the man's on death row for the
                        crime. plus, he's huge. if he
                        tried to get away, it'd take a lot
                        of bullets to stop him.

                                  brutal
                        we'd all have shotguns in addition
                        to sidearms. i'd insist on that.
                               (to paul)
                        he tried anything, we'd have to
                        take him down. you understand.

                                  paul
                        i understand.

                                  brutal
                               (beat)
                        so. tell us what you had in mind.

                                                       fade to black

              in blackness, a title card appears:

                                    "night journey"

                                                       cut to:
