              int. bitterbuck's cell - night

              bitterbuck, the top of his head now shaved, is speaking
              quietly as paul listens:

                                  bitterbuck
                        you think if a man sincerely
                        repents on what he done wrong, he
                        might get to go back to the time
                        that was happiest for him and live
                        there forever? could that be what
                        heaven is like?

              paul doesn't think so--but that's not what bitterbuck needs
              to hear, so the lie comes easy:

                                  paul
                        i just about believe that very
                        thing.

              pause. bitterbuck smiles.

                                  bitterbuck
                        had me a young wife when i was
                        eighteen. spent our first summer
                        in the mountains. made love every
                        night. she'd just lie there after,
                        bare-breasted in the firelight,
                        and we'd talk sometimes till the
                        sun come up.
                               (beat)
                        that was my best time.

              brutal appears at the door, checks his pocketwatch, nods to
              paul. bitterbuck takes a deep breath, getting himself ready.

                                  paul
                        it'll be fine. you'll do fine.
