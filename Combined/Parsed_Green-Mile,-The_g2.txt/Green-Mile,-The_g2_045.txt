              int. paul's house - dusk

              paul comes home from work, still looking numb about the whole
              thing. he drifts to the kitchen door. jan's at the counter,
              slicing vegetables for dinner. she glances at him.

                                  jan
                        hi, honey. how are you feeling?

                                  paul
                        um...not too bad.

              she turns back. paul's eyes drift down to admire her ass.

                                  jan
                        what did the doctor say?

              no response. he's too busy staring. she turns again--he
              glances hastily up.

                                  paul
                        oh, you know doctors. gobble-de-
                        gook mostly.

              she turns back, keeps working. he crosses the room, eyeing
              her ass all the way...and surprised her by pressing up
              against her from behind, running his hands along her hips.

                                  jan
                        paul? what are you doing?

              he starts laying kisses on the back of her neck, giving her
              pleasant shivers, murmuring:

                                  paul
                        what's it feel like?

                                  jan
                        i know what it feels like...it
                        feels great...but...paul...

              he's getting her breathless. she turns into his arms and they
              get into some passionate kissing. it's not too long before
              they're frantically peeling each other's clothes off...
