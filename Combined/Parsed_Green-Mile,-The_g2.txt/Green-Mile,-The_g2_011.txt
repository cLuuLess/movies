              int. tv room - day

              jerry springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience
              into a frenzy. pan off to reveal dozens of old folks watching
              on couches and folding chairs. an old black fellow named pete
              is grousing to a group of elderly ladies...

                                  pete
                        why we always watch this crap?

                                  elderly lady #1
                        it's interesting.

                                  pete
                        interesting? bunch'a inbred
                        trailer trash, all they ever talk
                        about is fucking...

              ...and we continue panning to paul and elaine sitting near
              the back, talking quietly as paul rubs his bruised hand:

                                  elaine
                        we should report him.

                                  paul
                        that might just provoke him all
                        the more, make things worse for
                        everybody.

                                  elaine
                        it's not everybody he has it in
                        for, paul. it's you.
                               (off his look)
                        what did you do to provoke him in
                        the first place? nothing. he's
                        just an abusive bully, and should
                        be made to stop.

                                  paul
                        ellie, please...

              pete

              is at the tv, switching channels while:

                                  elderly ladies
                        ...no, the movie classic channel
                        is further down...past the home
                        shopping...keep going...

              he finds the movie classic channel, which is playing an old
              black and white musical--"top hat," with fred astaire and
              ginger rogers. a delighted reaction:

                                  elderly lady #2
                        oh! this is wonderful...

              paul

              idly shifts his gaze to the tv...and his expression goes
              slack with recognition and dismay. elaine sees the look in
              his eyes.

              he glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in
              the end, he can't help himself. the past just caught up with
              him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to
              ride the rails...

              he looks back at the tv. on screen, fred and ginger have
              begun their famous "cheek to cheek" number, with astaire
              singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his:

                                  fred astaire
                        heaven, i'm in heaven...and my
                        heart beat so that i can hardly
                        speak...

              slow push in on paul, watching. he'd like to take his eyes
              off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than
              brad dolan's. elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:

                                  elaine
                        paul? what is it?

              no response. all he can hear is that music, all he can see
              are those dancers. the figures on tv are gliding with
              ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long
              ago...

              paul abruptly bursts into tears.

              the room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. all
              eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. paul just
              sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.

                                  elaine
                        paul...my god...

                                  orderly
                               (rushing over)
                        what is it? what's wrong?

                                  paul
                        it's okay...i'll be okay...

              another orderly appears--brad dolan. he puts his hand on
              paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.

                                  brad
                        s'matter, paulie? why the boo-hoo-
                        hoo? something nasty happen?

              elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.

                                  elaine
                        mr. edgecomb will be perfectly
                        fine without your help, thank you.

              brad back off with a "hey, suit yourself" gesture. elaine
              helps paul to his feet and leads him out.

                                                       cut to:
