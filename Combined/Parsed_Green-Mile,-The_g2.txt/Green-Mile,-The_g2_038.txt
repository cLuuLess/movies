              ...and he's moving even faster as he exits the kitchen,
              racing for the outhouse. he realizes he's not going to make
              it, stops to piss near the woodpile at the corner of the
              house...

              ...and as he does, he's hit with the most stunning pain of
              his life. he buckles to his knees--it's only his flailing
              hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face-
              first into his own piss. he crams his other hand to his mouth
              in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife.

              onto his side, rolls over on the grass, and stares up at the
              sky with both hands pressed to his groin.
