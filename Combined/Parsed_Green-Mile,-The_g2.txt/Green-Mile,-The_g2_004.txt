              int. corridor - morning

              the old and infirm haunt these corridors like ghosts. a woman
              inches along on a walker. a man shuffles by with a rolling
              i.v. stand. the floor is a limey, institutional green.

              paul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional
              greeting.
