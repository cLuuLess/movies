              int. e block - night

              ...and they bring him down the mile to the restraint room
              door. brutal takes percy's holster and baton.

                                  brutal
                        you'll get 'em back, don't worry.

                                  percy
                        that's more than i can say about
                        your jobs. all your jobs! you
                        can't do this to me! you can't!

              paul steps forward with a roll of strapping tape.

                                  paul
                        let you in on a little secret. we
                        can and we are.

              he slaps the tape over percy's mouth and shoves him back into
              the restraint room. percy stands breathing heavily through
              his nose, making muffled mmmmph-mmmph! sounds under the tape.

                                  paul
                        you're going to have a few hours
                        of quiet time now, so you can
                        reflect on what you did to del.

                                  brutal
                               (grins)
                        if you get lonely, think about
                        olive oyl...
                               (thrusting his hips)
                        ...uk-uk-uk-uk!

              and they slam the door, shutting percy into darkness.

              a wall-mounted gun safe

              is unlocked, shotguns pulled out. the men load up, heading
              down the mile as:

                                  paul
                        one more time--what do you say if
                        somebody comes by?

                                  dean
                        coffey got upset, so we put him in
                        the restraint room. they hear any
                        noise, they'll think it's him.

              they come to coffey's cell.

                                  coffey
                        we goan for the ride now?

                                  paul
                        that's right.

              the cell is unlocked. coffey emerges. paul motions them
              along, still grilling dean:

                                  paul
                        what about us?

                                  dean
                        you're over in admin, going over
                        del's file. brutal and harry are
                        in the laundry doing their wash--

              a skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from wild bill's cell
              and grabs coffey by the wrist. the men gasp, shocked to see
              billy on his feet, grinning and weaving like a punch-drunk.

              coffey's reaction is beyond simple surprise; he's actually
              trembling at billy's touch as if some electrical circuit were
              engaged. his eyes are wide and horrified, as if he'd just put
              his hand in a basket full of snakes. he tries to pull away,
              but billy has him tight, that mysterious circuit blazing.

                                  billy
                               (slurring wildly)
                        where you fink you're goin'?

              coffey responds softly, with utmost horror:

                                  coffey
                        you're a bad man.

                                  billy
                        s'right, nigger. bad as you'd want.

              paul plucks billy's hand off coffey's arm--and coffey
              flinches back as the circuit is broken.

                                  billy
                        whooeee. whole room's spinning.
                        like i'm shit-ass drunk. i have me
                        some shine or what?

              he turns and staggers back to his bunk, muttering all the way:

                                  billy
                        niggers oughtta have they own
                        'lectric chair. white man oughtn't
                        havta sit in no nigger 'lectric
                        chair, nossir...

              he goes face-first onto his bunk. coffey is still staring.

                                  coffey
                        he's a bad man.
