              ext. field - day(slow motion)

              ...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat. a small scrap
              of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly...

              color bleeds slowly in as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies
              skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow...

              suddenly, a man with a shotgun comes crashing through the
              cattails, wiping through frame and exiting...

              ...then another man...and another...armed with rifles,
              plowing through the brush, exiting frame...

              ...and now comes klaus detterick, a farmer one step above

              of dogs, trying to untangle the leads. deputy rob mcgee is
              shouting for everybody to stay together...

              ...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper:

                                  whispering voice (v.o.)
                        you love your sister? you make any
                        noise, know what happens?

              and off that horrible voice, we

                                                       cut to:
