              int. execution chamber - day

              the steel cap is lowered over toot's head, the straps
              tightened. tilt up to percy as:

                                  percy
                        roll on two.

              behind his partition, van hay mimes flipping the switch.

                                  van hay
                        that's that.

              a pause. percy looks anxiously to paul, who's trading glances
              with the other guards. finally:

                                  paul
                        very good. very professional.

              percy smiles. harry and dean step up, slapping his back and
              shaking his hand...
