              int. paul's kitchen - morning

              paul looks feverish and clammy as he buttons up his uniform
              jacket. jan is packing his lunch, throwing him looks, knowing
              how sick he is.

                                  paul
                        i'm going.

                                  jan
                        what?

                                  paul
                        to the doctor. i'm going.
                               (off her look)
                        today. just as soon as we get the
                        new inmate squares away.

                                  jan
                        that bad?

                                  paul
                        oh yeah.

              she hands him his brown-bagged lunch, kisses his face.
