              ext. moores house - night

              paul and the men hustle coffey out the front door toward the
              truck, helping him as best they can. he's weak as a baby,
              knees threatening to give out at any moment.

                                  paul
                        c'mon, john, stay on your feet.

                                  harry
                        christ, he goes down, we'll need
                        three mules and a crane to pick
                        him up again...

              they get coffey to the truck and throw their backs into it,
              helping him crawl up onto the stakebed. he rolls over on his
              back. harry hops up, covers him with an old blanket. brutal
              pulls aside, speaking low:

                                  brutal
                        he'll never sit in old sparky. you
                        know that, don't you?
                               (off paul's look)
                        he swallowed that stuff for a
                        reason. i give him a few days. one
                        of us'll be doing a cell check and
                        there he'll be. dead on his bunk.

                                  paul
                        if that's his choice, he's earned
                        it.
                               (beat)
                        let's get him back on the mile.

                                                       fade to black

              in blackness, a title card appears:

                                  "coffey on the mile"
