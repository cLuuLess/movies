              int. coffey's cell - day

              coffey's lying on his bunk, weeping quiet tears. he stirs at
              the sound of giggling. he sits up, peers curiously through
              the bars. softly:

                                  coffey
                        del?

              at the guard station

              paul glances up from writing in the daily log. silence now.
              he goes back to writing--and the giggling comes again.

                                  paul
                        delacroix? that you?

              no answer. just more giggling. paul rises, walks down the
              mile to delacroix's cell--and stops, staring in through the
              bars.

              paul's inner office

              brutal and dean are having lunch. paul pokes his head in.

                                  paul
                        you are not gonna believe this.

              resume e block

              the men follow paul onto the mile. by now, del is cackling
              wildly in his cell. brutal shoots paul a look--has he gone
              insane? paul gestures "see for yourself."

              they arrive at the bars...and find the mouse sitting on del's
              shoulder. del looks up, giggling like a kid at christmas.

                                  del
                        look! i done tame me dat mouse!

                                  paul
                        we see that.

                                  del
                        watch dis! watch what he do!

              he stretches out his left arm. the mouse crawls over the top
              of his head, scampers along his arm to the wrist, turns
              around and scampers back. the guards just stand there,
              staring.

                                  del
                        ain't he sumpthin now? ain't mr.
                        jingles smart?

                                  paul
                        mr. jingles?

                                  del
                        dat his name. he whisper it in my
                        ear. cap'n, can i have a box for
                        my mouse so he can sleep in here
                        wi' me?

                                  paul
                        i notice your english gets better
                        when you want something.

                                  del
                        wanna see what else he can do?
                        watch, watch, watch...

              he puts the mouse on the floor, grabs a small wooden spool.
              the mouse sees it, poises like a man getting ready for a race.

                                  del
                        we play fetch, mr. jingles? we
                        play fetch?

              he tosses the spool across the floor, bounces it against the
              wall. the mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick--and
              proceeds to push it back to the bunk, rolling it with its
              front paws all the way to delacroix's feet.

              by now, the guard's jaws are hanging open. paul's got a funny
              little chill running up his spine.

                                  del
                        he fetch it ever' time. smart as
                        hell, ain't he? we do da trick
                        again, watch, watch, watch...

              again he throws the spool. again the mouse goes after it,
              starts rolling it back. del howls with laughter, claps his
              hands like a kid. brutal murmurs to the others:

                                  brutal
                        who's training who here?

                                  coffey
                        that's some smart mouse, del. like
                        he's a circus mouse or something.

                                  del
                        a circus mouse! dat jus' what he
                        is, too! a circus mouse! i get
                        outta here, he make me rich, see
                        if he don't!

              he picks up the spool again, makes a drumroll sound, tosses
              it. the mouse does its thing, rolling the spool back...

              ...as percy enters the scene. del catches sight of him and
              scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk. he
              tries to hide mr. jingles in his hands--but the mouse
              wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head,
              where he regards percy with mistrustful, beady mouse eyes.

                                  percy
                        well, well. looks like you found
                        yourself a new friend, eddie.

              del tries to offer some defiance--but all he can manage is:

                                  del
                        don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay?

              percy shrugs as if to say "no skin off me", looks to paul.

                                  percy
                        that the one i chased?

                                  paul
                               (level)
                        yes, that's the one. only del says
                        his name is mr. jingles.

                                  percy
                        is that so?

              paul trades a look with the others, everybody wondering just
              what the hell's going through percy's mind.

                                  paul
                        del was just asking for a box. he
                        thinks the mouse will sleep in it,
                        i guess. that he might keep it for
                        a pet. what do you think?

                                  percy
                        i think it'll shit up his nose
                        some night and run away, but i
                        guess that's del's lookout.
                               (beat)
                        we oughtta find a cigar box. get
                        some cotton batting from he
                        dispensary to line it with. that
                        should do real nice.

              percy walks away, leaving them dumbstruck. paul turns to the
              others. of all the things they've seen in the last few
              minutes, percy being nice is the most amazing of all.

                                  paul
                        man said get a cigar box.

                                                       cut to:
