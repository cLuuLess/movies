              int. sun room - day

              paul is staring out the windows, pensive and drained. it's
              raining now, pattering the glass and the lawn beyond. elaine
              waits across from him, wishing he would speak. softly:

                                  paul
                        i guess sometimes the past just
                        catches up with you, whether you
                        want it to or not. it's silly.

                                  elaine
                        was it the film?
                               (off his look)
                        it was, wasn't it?

                                  paul
                        i haven't spoken of these things
                        in a long time, ellie. over sixty
                        years.

              she reaches out, gently takes his hand.

                                  elaine
                        paul. i'm your friend.

                                  paul
                        yes. yes you are.

              paul wonders if he's even up to talking about it after all
              this time...and decides that perhaps he is:

                                  paul
                        i ever tell you i was a prison
                        guard during the depression?

                                  elaine
                        you've mentioned it.

                                  paul
                        did i mention i was in charge of
                        death row? that i supervised all
                        the executions?

              this does come as a surprise. she shakes her head.

                                  paul
                        they usually call death row the
                        last mile, but we called ours the
                        green mile, because the floor was
                        the color of faded limes. we had
                        the electric chair then. old
                        sparky, we called it.
                               (beat)
                        i've lived a lot of years, ellie,
                        but 1935 takes the prize. that was
                        the year i had the worst urinary
                        infection of my life. that was
                        also the year of john coffey, and
                        the two dead girls...

                                                       fade to black

              in blackness, a title card appears:

                                  "the two dead girls"

                                                       cut to:
