     int. county office - night

                                ww
                   actually, then, mister corcoran
                   was faster on the draw than the
                   d... english bob?

     ww is sitting at little bill's desk writing furiously with a
     quill pen.  it is still night and little bill is lounging in
     a chair and english bob is moaning and snoring in the cell.

                            little bill
                   faster?  fast was his mistake.  if
                   he hadn't of been in such a
                   goddamn hurry he would not have
                   shot off his toe with his first
                   shot and he would have killed old
                   bob.
                            (lecturing)
                   see, son, bein' a good shot an'
                   bein' quick with a pistol... that
                   don't do no harm... but it ain't
                   much next to bein' cool.

     little bill pulls out his pistol very deliberately... not
     slowly, but not like a hollywood fast draw.

                        little bill (cont'd)
                   a man who will keep his head an'
                   not get rattled under fire... he
                   will kill you like as not.

     little bill is pointing his pistol, aiming.

                                ww
                   but if the other fellow is quicker
                   and fires first...

                            little bill
                   he will be hurryin' and he will
                   miss.  that there is as fast as i
                   can pull an' aim an' hit anythin'
                   more'n ten feet away... unless
                   it's a barn.

                                ww
                   but... if he doesn't miss?

                            little bill
                     (laughing and holstering
                            his pistol)
                   then he will kill you.  that is
                   why there are so few dangerous men
                   like old bob there... an' like me.
                   it ain't so easy to shoot a man
                   anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch
                   is shootin' back at you... well,
                   it'll unnerve most fellas.
                       (struck with an idea)
                   look here, let me show you
                   somethin'.
                        (he reaches into a
                        drawer in the desk
                      and pulls out a pistol)
                   see this here pistol?

     ww looks at the pistol uneasily and over in the cell english
     bob's one eye opens and he moves his head slightly because
     he senses something is happening.

     little bill holds the pistols out to ww.

                            little bill
                   take it.
                           (ww hesitates)
                   go on, take a hold.

     nervously ww accepts the gun as though it were hot.  little
     bill pulls some keys out of a drawer and tosses them on the
     desk.

                            little bill
                   them's the keys.  all you gotta do
                   is shoot me an' you an' english
                   bob can ride out free as birds.

                                ww
                             (shaking)
                   is... is it... loaded?

                            little bill
                   wouldn't be no good if it wasn't.
                   you got to cock it though.

     ww looks nervously over at english bob and bob's eye says
     "do it, do it, do it."

     ww gulps and he pulls back the hammer and stands up and
     looks at bob again and bob is nodding "yes, yes, do it."

                            little bill
                   an' you got to point it.
                              (pause)
                   go on, point it.

     slowly, with trembling hand ww raises the gun and points it
     at little bill who looks calmly back at him.

                            little bill
                   all you gotta do is pull on
                   the trigger, mister.

     ww gulps and sweat comes off his forehead and he points the
     shaking gun and bob nods "yes" and ww bites his lip and
     then...

     ww lowers the gun slowly.  he can't do it.  he wipes his
     forehead.

                            little bill
                   hot, ain't it?
                      (reaching for the gun)
                   you never even put your finger
                   on the trigger.

     little bill is reaching for the pistol but ww has a
     frightening idea and instead of giving up the pistol he
     steps backward toward the cell.

                                ww
                   what if... what if i gave it to...
                   him.
                      (and he indicates bob)

     little bill's eyes narrow like slits and tension fills the
     air.

                            little bill
                   go ahead... give it to him.

     english bob's eye lights up in anticipation and he tries
     to get up on one elbow.

                                ww
                             (gulping)
                   r-r-r-really?  you r-r-really
                   w-w-want...?

                            little bill
                            (like ice)
                   give it to him.

     english bob is sitting up and reaching for the gun and his
     eye is on little bill and ww reaches out with a shaking hand
     and english bob's hand just touches the gun and...

     little bill drops his right hand to his own gun and grips
     the butt and...

     english bob hesitates, his gaze locked with little bill's
     and the two men eye each other.  then, furious, english bob
     withdraws his hand... empty.

                            little bill
                            (grinning)
                   guess he don't want it, mister
                   beauchamp.

     little bill accepts the pistol from the trembling ww and,
     looking straight into english bob's angry eye, little bill
     ejects five cartridges from the chambers of the pistol.

                            little bill
                   you was right not to take it, bob.
                   i would of killed you.

     ww collapses into a chair and wipes sweat from his brow.

                      little bill's voice o.s.
                   we could use some rain, eh, mister
                   beauchamp?
