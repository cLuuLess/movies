     int. alice's room - night

     alice's room and the whores.  they are sitting glumly in the
     dim light of a simple lamp.  little sue is wiping tears away
     and delilah is staring blankly.

                              delilah
                     (to no one in particular)
                   i didn't think they'd really do it.

                               alice
                              (nasty)
                   what did you think, they come
                   clear up from kansas to fuck us?

                              delilah
                             (vacantly)
                   that kid... he's just a... boy.
                   and that other one, bill, being
                   true to his wife...

                               alice
                   what wife?  he don't have no wife.

                              delilah
                          (shocked, hurt)
                   he said...

                               alice
                   i told you, he don't have no
                   wife, not aboveground, anyhow.

     delilah just eats the pain raw and just then...

     smash!  a rock comes through the window and you can hear
     someone shouting.

                         voice outside o.s.
                   you fuckin' murderin' whores.

     and they all sit there stunned and then alice recovers and
     gets up and goes to the window and hurls the rock back.

                               alice
                             (shouting)
                   he had it coming!  he had it
                   coming for what he did... and
                   that other one too... both of
                   them... for what they done.
