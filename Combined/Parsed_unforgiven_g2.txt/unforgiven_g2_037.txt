     ext. trees - day

     view on munny

     bedraggled and sweaty, walking into the clump of trees
     leading his horse and ned, behind him, leading his roan and
     looking just as bad.

                               munny
                   had to chase the damn horse a
                   mile.

     the kid is sitting under the shade tree looking sullen.

                                ned
                              (angry)
                   what was you shootin' at us
                   for, anyhow?

                              the kid
                   thought you was followin' me.

                               munny
                   well, we was.  like you said,
                   i changed my mind an'...

                              the kid
                   wasn't nothin' said about no
                   partner.

                                ned
                   well, this here's ned logan...
                   ned, this here's the schofield
                   kid, nephew of pete sothow an'...

                              the kid
                   i seen two fellas followin' me,
                   i guessed they come to kill me.
                              (pause)
                   we didn't talk about no other fella.

                               munny
                       (squatting in front of
                        the kid, talking in
                         a persuasive tone)
                   well, now kid, there's two of
                   these cowboys, ain't that so?
                   better there's three of us...
                   maybe them cowboys got friends.
                   maybe...

                              the kid
                   i was gonna kill them two by
                   myself.  it don't take three.

     ned walks over to where the kid's rifle is leaning against
     the tree and the kid is watching nervously.

                               munny
                   now ned's a hell of a shot with a
                   rifle.  hell, he can hit a bird
                   in the eye flyin'.

                                ned
                       (picking up the kid's
                               rifle)
                   better'n you anyhow, kid.  you
                   wasn't comin' close.

                              the kid
                   keep your damn hands offa that
                   rifle, mister.

     the kid is touching his pistol and ned puts the rifle down,
     annoyed.

                                ned
                   i was only checkin' it for you.
                   thought maybe somethin' was bent.

                              the kid
                   nothin's bent.

                                ned
                   well, you was shootin' every
                   which way an'...

                              the kid
                            (to munny)
                   you gonna share your half with him?

                               munny
                   three ways, i figured.

                              the kid
                   no.

                               munny
                              (to ned)
                   sorry, ned.  guess i wasted your
                   time.  see ya, kid!

     munny turns to go and ned gives the kid a disgusted look and
     turns away.

                              the kid
                            (to munny)
                   you're goin' back with him?

                               munny
                             (turning)
                   he's my partner.  he don't go,
                   i don't.

     ned is mounted and munny starts to mount too, but the mare
     is as reluctant as ever, shying and prancing while munny
     hops awkwardly with one foot in the stirrup.

                              the kid
                   what's it come to, three ways?

     munny turns and looks at the kid.
