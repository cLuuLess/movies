     ext. trees - day

     the kid rifle at his cheek is crouched behind one of the
     trees.  his horse is standing nearby.

                         munny's voice o.s.
                   hey, kid, is that you?  it's
                   me, bill munny.

     the kid is frowning and finally he makes up his mind.

                              the kid
                            (shouting)
                   yeah.  it's me.

                         munny's voice o.s.
                   don't shoot at us no more, okay?

     the kid is peering around the tree and squinting
     ferociously.

     his pov:

     the field.  it is one big blur.  he can't see worth a shit.

     the kid squinting and peering and worrying.

                              the kid
                   who you got with you?

                         munny's voice o.s.
                   ned logan.  my old partner, ned
                   logan.  don't you shoot no more,
                   okay?

     the kid doesn't like it, he's nervous and twitching, trying
     desperately to see what's going  on out there.

                         munny's voice o.s.
                   we're gonna collect our horses an'
                   come on over.  you ain't gonna
                   shoot no more, are you?

                              the kid
                   no, i ain't.
