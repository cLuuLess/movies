     ext. main street - night

     munny riding down the dark, lonely street at a trot and he
     starts to shout at the top of his lungs.

                               munny
                   you boys better bury old ned
                   right... and you better not carve
                   up nor otherwise harm no
                   whores... or i will come back an'
                   kill more sonsabitches, hear?

     and there are tears running down munny's cheeks.
