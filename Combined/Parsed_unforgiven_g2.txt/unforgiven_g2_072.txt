     ext. boulders - day

     ned aiming and shaking.

                              the kid
                   what happened?  he ain't dead?
                   what's goin' on?

                               munny
                              (to ned)
                   if he gets behind them rocks we
                   ain't gonna get him... not
                   without we go down there.

                              the kid
                   what rocks?  why don't you shoot?
                   what's goin' on?

                        johnny's voice o.s.
                   fuckin' bushwhackin' assholes.

     and looking down the barrel ned can see davey crawling for
     the rocks and it is an easy shot and he can't do it and he
     looks up at munny and the agony in his eyes says it all.

                              the kid
                   ain't you gonna shoot?  is he
                   dead?

     munny grabs the rifle and ned moves aside and slumps against
     a rock and munny looks down the barrel and aims.

                               munny
                   i ain't much of a shot.
