     int. delilah's room - night

     delilah on her bed, her face covered with blood-soaked rags
     except for her eyes.  alice has hot water and is ministering
     to her and little bill is looking down at her from his
     enormous height, still in his bearskin.  he looks disgusted.

                            little bill
                   she ain't gonna die, huh?

     you can now see fear in delilah's eyes, and the other whores
     ...crow creek kate with crazy pop-eyes and frizzy hair, and
     little sue who is fifteen and meek even when she isn't
     terrified, and faith who is the oldest of them and not very
     attractive and silky who is blonde and the prettiest... are
     watching from vantage points in the doorway or in the room.

                               alice
                            (determined)
                   she's gonna live.
                     (little bill turns to go)
                   she didn't steal nothin',
                   she didn't touch his poke.

                            little bill
                       (stopping and turning)
                   no?

                               alice
                   all she done was... when she
                   seen he had a teensy little
                   pecker... she gave a giggle.
                   that's all.  she didn't know
                   no better.

     little bill turns away, disgusted, and starts out of the
     room and alice gets up and follows him.

                               alice
                   you gonna hang 'em, little bill?
