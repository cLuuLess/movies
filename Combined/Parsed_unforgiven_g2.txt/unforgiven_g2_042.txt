     ext. woods - night

     night in the woods and ned fussing around with his blankets
     not far from the campfire.

                                ned
                            (irritably)
                   no sir, i did not give up robbin'
                   an' stealin' on account of i got
                   religion.  i give it up 'cause i
                   got too old for all this here
                   nature.

     munny is lying in his blankets a few feet away, exhausted
     and dirty and not a bit interested in ned's complaints.

                            ned (cont'd)
                   i give it up 'cause i hate
                   sleepin' out in the air...
                   fuckin' sticks in my food... an'
                   fuckin' bugs in my food... an'
                   fuckin' rocks under my back...
                        (crawling into the
                             blankets)
                   shit, i sure do miss my fuckin'
                   bed.

                               munny
                            (irritably)
                   yeah... you said that last night.

                                ned
                   last night i said i missed my
                   fuckin' wife...  tonight i just
                   miss my fuckin' bed.

     lightning flashes and a horse whinnies and then the thunder
     cracks and rolls.

                               munny
                   well, i guess you're gonna miss
                   your fuckin' roof soon enough.
