     ext. alice's room - night

     ned pushing the kid out the window of alice's room and the
     kid isn't fully dressed and neither is ned but he pushes him
     frantically into the rainy night anyway and alice is urging
     them on and little sue looks ready to wet her pants.

                               alice
                             (to ned)
                   hurry.
                          (to little sue)
                   you know what to say to little bill?

     little sue nods "yes" but she is speechless with terror and
     alice hands ned's boots out the window to him.
