     ext. camp - day

     barrrrroom!  thunder, lightning, rain in sheets and the
     albino mare rearing and screaming and munny landing in the
     mud.

                               munny
                   you fucking no-good goddamn shit-
                   faced pig fucking dirty whore.

     it is daylight but the rain is so thick you can't see more
     than five feet and munny crawls up out of the mud wearing a
     slicker and looking like hell, already full of remorse for
     his outburst.

     ned rides up out of the rain leading munny's horse and munny
     tries to mount again.

                               munny
                   i didn't mean it, old gal.

     the albino rears but ned is helping and he holds the horse
     and then grabs the seat of munny's muddy pants and half
     shoves him into the saddle.

     up ahead, barely visible in the rain, the kid is holding
     back his horse impatiently.

                              the kid
                   let's go.
