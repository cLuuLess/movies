     int. jail - day

     close on ned's face jammed against the bars of the cell in
     the county office.  he has been tied to the bars outside the
     cell so that he is, more or less, spread-eagled in an
     upright position with his bare back exposed to little bill
     and charley hecker and ww beauchamp.

                            little bill
                   now then, ned... you an'...
                   uh... mister quincy an' uh...
                   what was that young feller's
                   name?

                                ned
                   tate.  elroy tate.

     ww shakes his head at little bill and holds out his notebook
     for little bill to see.

                            little bill
                   that ain't what you said before,
                   ned.

     little bill empties hot coals from the bowl of his pipe on
     ned's shoulders and ned writhes and grots his teeth.

                                ned
                   hellif it ain't.

                            little bill
                      (looking at ww's notes)
                   before you said elroy quincy
                   out of medicine hat an' henry
                   tate out of cheyenne.

                                ned
                   fuck if i did.

                            little bill
                        (refilling his pipe)
                   charley, go bring them whores
                   here that fucked these boys the
                   night of the storm.

                              charley
                   strawberry alice an' silky?

                            little bill
                   yeah... an' fetch a bullwhip out
                   of the german's.

     ned's face against the bars is covered with perspiration and
     etched with fear as he hears the door close behind charley.

                            little bill
                        (lighting his pipe)
                   now, ned... them whores are gonna
                   lie different lies than you...
                   an' when your lie ain't the same
                   as their lie... i ain't gonna
                   hurt no woman, i'm gonna hurt
                   you... not gentle like i been
                   doin' but... baaaad.

     ned swallows hard and sweats and waits.
