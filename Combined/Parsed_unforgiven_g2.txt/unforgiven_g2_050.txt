     ext. train tracks - day

     thunder and lightning and the train chugging through the
     storm.  a second flash of lightning reveals three drenched
     riders near the tracks and one of them is having trouble
     controlling his white horse.

     of course it is munny and as he tries to hold the shying
     mare a flash of lightning lights up a passing railroad coach
     and munny gets just a glimpse of a strange battered face in
     the window.

     the kid is handing the whiskey bottle back to ned and ned
     offers it to munny again.

                                ned
                   you sure, bill?

     and munny just shakes his head and wipes rain from his eyes.
