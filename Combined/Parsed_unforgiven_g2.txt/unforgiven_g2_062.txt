     int. shed - night

     close on a lantern hanging from a beam in the shed and it is
     night again and the rain has stopped though you can still
     hear water dripping from the eaves.

                              the kid
                   it was a lot of shit what my
                   uncle told me, huh?

     they are playing cards on the straw floor, ned and the kid
     and ned doesn't look up from his cards.

                                ned
                   depends what he told you.
                              (pause)
                   about bill, you mean?

                              the kid
                   all of it.  about him, an' you
                   an' uncle pete... about robbin'
                   the rock island pacific... an'
                   about them missouri banks.

                                ned
                   we done that stuff.

                              the kid
                   well i guess bill munny wasn't
                   no fearless killer an' bank
                   robber like he said.

     in the other corner of the room munny gives a loud moan and
     both men look at him and then back to their cards.

                                ned
                   kid, it ain't gonna mean nothin'
                   to you, but the roof i built on
                   my house, it don't have a leak
                   in it... not one.
                     (the kid looks perplexed)
                   most folks think a school house
                   is the first sign of civilizin'...
                   but i say it's a good roof.

     well, that amazes the kid, being stuck here with these train
     robber-bad men and now this shit about roofs and he just
     stares.

                         munny's voice o.s.
                   claudia... no... oh, jesus,
                   claudia, ohh...

     ned gets up and takes the lantern over to where munny is
     lying and kneels beside him.  munny looks ghastly, at
     death's door.

                                ned
                   claudia... ain't here, bill.

                               munny
                             (reaching)
                   ned... is that you, ned?
                        (holding ned's arm)
                   ned, i seen... death.

                                ned
                   easy, bill.

                               munny
                   i seen the angel of death ned,
                   an' i seen the river.
                             (panicked)
                   he's a snake, he got... snake eyes.

                                ned
                   who, bill?  who got snake eyes?

                               munny
                   the angel... the angel of death.
                   i'm scared, ned.  ned, i'm gonna
                   die.

                                ned
                   easy, bill, easy.

     the kid has walked over and is watching and it fascinates
     and scares him and he watches and swallows hard.

                               munny
                   i seen her... i seen claudia too...

                                ned
                             (soothing)
                   well, that's good now, ain't
                   it, bill?  seein' claudia an...?

                               munny
                   she was all covered with worms.
                   oh, ned, i'm scared of dyin'...

     the kid can't takes any more and he turns and walks away and
     ned tries to comfort munny and munny grabs him and pulls him
     close.

                               munny
                   ned... don't tell nobody... don't
                   tell the kids... don't tell 'em
                   none of... none of the things i
                   done.

     and ned has tears in his eyes and munny's eyes are staring
     and he is seeing something horrible and we
