     ext. box canyon - day

     davey crawling and crack!  the dust kicks up eight feet
     away.  he is ten yards from the boulders and it is agony to
     crawl.

                         lippy's voice o.s.
                   keep goin', davey boy.

     crack!  dust puffs up three feet from davey's head.
