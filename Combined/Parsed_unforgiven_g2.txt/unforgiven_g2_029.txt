     ext. train stop - day

     bawling cattle milling in the pens south of big whiskey, and
     the train hissing and steaming at a standstill.

     close view

     two leather valises and a leather rifle case as muddy
     chandler tosses them on his mud wagon, a sort of open
     stagecoach.  the scene is one of chaos as the train steams
     and hisses and baggage is tossed off and more is tossed on.

                              chandler
                   it's a nickel up to big whiskey,
                   gentlemen.

     ww hands chandler the money and, as he and english bob climb
     into the mud wagon, they are accosted by germany joe schultz
     who runs the livery stable and does horse business with
     railway passengers on the side.

                            germany joe
