     ext. boulders - day

     munny sweating and looking up at the sun, and ned staring
     vacantly.

                         davey's voice o.s.
                   i'm thirsty, slim, jesus, i'm
                   thirsty.
                              (pause)
                   bring me a drink won't you, slim?
                   one drink, slim... i'm dyin', slim...
                              (pause)
                   boys, bring me a drink.

     it is getting to all three of them and munny looks up at the
     sun and then ned gets up and he walks over to a rock and he
     vomits.

                        davey's voice o.s.
                   one drink... please, boys...
                   just one d...

                               munny
                       (leaping up, shouting)
                   bring him some goddamn water,
                   you assholes.

     the boulders.  nothing happens, you can't tell if the
     cowboys are behind there or not.

                         davey's voice o.s.
                   please boys... i'm shot in the
                   gut... i'm bleedin'... bring me...

                               munny
                             (shouting)
                   will you take him a fucking drink
                   for christ sake!  we ain't gonna
                   shoot.

     there is a pause and munny looks down at the boulders where
     the cowboys are hiding.

                         texas slim's voice
                      (from behind the boulder)
                   you ain't gonna shoot?

                               munny
                   no.

     and then, after a long moment, munny sees texas slim come
     out from behind the boulder and run nervously toward the
     rock where davey lies and he is carrying a canteen.

                        johnny's voice o.s.
                   don't you shoot him, you assholes.

     the kid is trying to see but of course he can't.

                              the kid
                   they takin' water?

                               munny
                   yeah.

     munny is watching and he sees texas slim disappear behind
     the boulder where davey is lying and there is a moment of
     silence... and then the voice, a scream of grief and
     anguish...

                         texas slim's voice
                      (from behind the boulder)
                   oh, jesus, johnny, they've killed
                   him... they've shot up his gut...
                   oh jesus, they've killed young
                   davey... oh, those murderin'
                   bastards, they've killed our
                   davey...

     and the kid spits in the dust and ned wipes his forehead
     with his bandanna and munny scuffs the dirt with his boot.


     hooves on flat rock and the three riders, munny, ned and the
     kid, are trotting their horses over a smooth slab of rock
     near a hill.  they are silent, glum, then,

                              the kid
                   when we gonna double back?

                               munny
                   after a ways.

                                ned
                       (not looking at them)
                   not me.

     munny looks up sharply but ned just looks straight ahead.

                                ned
                   i'm goin' on down to kansas.

                               munny
                   we got to kill this other one
                   first.
                        (ned doesn't answer)
                   shit, ned, if we're lucky, we
                   could kill him by nightfall...
                   or maybe tomorrow morning.
                   then we could head back, all
                   three of us, with the money.

     ned reins in his horse and munny pulls up too and then the
     kid.

                                ned
                          (looking him in
                              the eye)
                   you want the spencer, bill?
                     (he holds out the rifle)

                               munny
                              (lamely)
                   shit, ned, this ain't the time
                   to quit.

                              the kid
                   you're gonna lose your share.
                   if you don't...

                               munny
                   shut up, kid.

     ned just holds out the rifle and after a moment munny takes
     it and ned takes a box of cartridges from his pocket and
     hands them over.

                                ned
                   i'll see you, bill.  see you, kid.

     and he turns his horse and heads off across open country at
     a trot and munny watches him go till he's about fifty yards
     away.

                               munny
                             (shouting)
                   hold on, ned.

     and ned reins up and munny gallops up to him and holds out
     the spencer and the bullets.

                               munny
                   i ain't worth a shit with it.

     ned takes the rifle, sheathes it, gives a curt nod and turns
     to go.

                               munny
                   me an' the kid, we'll head over to
                   the ranch an' as soon as we find
                   him, we'll shoot him.  then we'll
                   come back an' the three of us pick
                   up the money an' head south
                   together.

                                ned
                   supposin' he don't go to the ranch?

                               munny
                   i'll bet anything he won't go to
                   town nor he won't ride out on the
                   range.  right off he'll hole up at
                   the ranch.

                                ned
                           (turning away)
                   i ain't waitin', bill.
                           (looking back)
                   i'll look in on your youngsters
                   when i get back.

                               munny
                        (calling after him)
                   ned, don't pay no mind to what the
                   kid said about the money.  i'll
                   bring your share along, hear?  the
                   kid's full of shit, hear?
