     ext. mud wagon - day

     english bob and ww riding in the mud wagon, bouncing
     uncomfortably in spite of the slow pace, and eating dust and
     sweating profusely.

                            english bob
                            (irritably)
                   it's the climate does it.  that
                   and the infernal distances.

                                ww
                   does what?

                            english bob
                   induces people to shoot persons
                   in high places.
                     (mopping his brow with his
                           (handkerchief)
                   it's a savage country.  that's
                   the second one shot in twenty
                   years.  it's uncivilized shooting
                   people of substance.

     the mud wagon rattles past the south road sign.  it is
     similar to the one of the north road and says:

                   no firearms in big whiskey.
                   ordinance 14.
                   deposit pistols and rifles
                   county office.
