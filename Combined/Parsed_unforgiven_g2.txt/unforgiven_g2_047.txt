     ext. open country - day

     a little later.  rain.  ned and munny riding side by side
     through the downpour and the kid twenty yards ahead, barely
     visible.  munny looks like shit and ned looks at him with
     concern, deliberates, then reaches into his saddle bag and
     pulls out a bottle of whiskey and offers it.

                                ned
                   i brung this for when we had to
                   kill them fellows.
                       (munny glances at it
                          and looks away)
                   i guess we could use some now.

                               munny
                   not for me.  i don't touch it no
                   more.

                                ned
                           (exasperated)
                   god damn it, bill, it's rainin'.

                               munny
                   i know it's rainin',
                          (looking ahead)
                   give the kid a drink, why dontcha?

     ned takes a long pull on the bottle, re-corks it and puts it
     in his saddle bag.  he looks sympathetically at his friend
     hunched unhappily in his saddle.

                                ned
                   you think the kid really killed
                   five men?

     munny just shrugs and looks back at the trail and keeps
     riding.

                               munny
                          (after a while)
                   no.

                                ned
                   what he was talkin' about... how
                   them deputies had the drop on you
                   an' pete...

                               munny
                   yeah?

                                ned
                   i remember how there was three of
                   them deputies you shot... not two.

                               munny
                          (dismissing it)
                   well, i ain't like that no more,
                   ned.  i ain't no crazy, killin'
                   fool.

                                ned
                          (after a while)
                   you still think it'll be easy
                   shootin' them cowboys?

     munny shrugs and looks straight ahead into the rain.  of
     course, it won't be easy... and they both know it.

                               munny
                   if we don't drown first.
