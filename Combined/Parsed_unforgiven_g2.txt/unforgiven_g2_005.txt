     int. bar room - night

     davey sitting naked on the floor of the bar room and mike is
     sitting near him, still in his leggings and both men are
     shivering because they are fifteen feet from the potbellied
     stove where clyde is standing watching them.

     it is a big room, with a crude bar and four tables and some
     moose and elk heads on the wall.  the door near the rear
     where it says "billiard room" leads not to a billiard room
     but to the six little "rooms" that are the whorehouse and
     and now you can hear delilah groaning from there.

     and little bill enters from the back of the bar room,
     stooping to pass through the doorway under the sign that
     says "billiard room."

     little bill is huge and ominous.  some say he acquired the
     bearskin by staring the bear to death and others say he
     drowned the animal in spit.  anyhow, he's big with a
     drooping moustache and he is sucking on his church warden's
     clay pipe and you know he isn't scared of anything.

     and the two cowboys are scared to death, not just shivering
     from the cold, and bill just looks down at them and sucks on
     his pipe and alice comes in from the back way too and then
     skinny and a couple of the whores gather in the doorway.

                            little bill
                   clyde, step across to the german's
                   an' fetch up one of his bullwhips.

     stark terror on the faces of davey and mike as clyde exits.

                               alice
                   a whippin'?  that's all they get?
                   after what they done?

                            little bill
                       (sucking on his pipe)
                   whippin' ain't a little thing,
                   alice.

                               alice
                   but what they done, they...

                              skinny
                     (he has a piece of paper
                           in his hand)
                   shut up, alice.  little bill,
                   a whippin' ain't gonna settle
                   this.

                            little bill
                   no?

                              skinny
                        (showing the paper)
                   this here's a lawful contract...
                   betwixt me an' delilah
                   fitzgerald, the cut-whore.  now i
                   brung her clear from boston, paid
                   her expenses an' all, an' i got a
                   contract which represents an
                   investment of capital.

                            little bill
                        (sympathetic to the
                             argument)
                   property.

                              skinny
                   damaged property.  like if i
                   was to hamstring one of their
                   cow ponies.

                            little bill
                   you figure nobody'll want to
                   fuck her.

                              skinny
                   hell no.  leastways, they won't
                   pay to do it.

     alice is listening to this and her eyes are like coals and
     you can hear delilah moaning in the other room.

                          skinny (cont'd)
                   she could maybe clean up around
                   the place or somethin', but
                   nobody's gonna pay good money
                   for a cut-up whore.

                            little bill
                      (making up his mind and
                           turning to the
                         shivering cowboys)
                   you boys are off of the spade
                   outfit.  got your own string
                   of ponies?

                               davey
                             (nodding)
                   i... i got f-f-f-four.

                            little bill
                   you?

                               mike
                            (sullenly)
                   six.

     skinny nods, pleased, and alice watches, her eyes still hot.

                            little bill
                   guess you boys just as soon not
                   have no trial an' fuss, huh?

     davey and mike nod, willing to say anything little bill
     wants.

                        little bill cont'd
                            (to mike)
                   alright.  you done the cuttin'...
                   come the thaw, you bring in five
                   of them ponies an' give 'em over
                   to skinny here.

                               mike
                   five!

                            little bill
                             (to davey)
                   an' you... you give over two
                   ponies, hear? -

     clyde bangs in out of the snow with a buggy whip in his
     hand.

                               clyde
                   i couldn't find no bullwhips,
                   bill.  the german...

                            little bill
                   don't matter, we don't need no
                   whips.
                        (to mike and davey)
                   spring comes an' skinny don't
                   have them ponies, i'm gonna...

                               alice
                   you... you ain't even gonna...
                   whip 'em?

                            little bill
                   i fined 'em instead.

                               alice
                   for what they done?  skinny gets
                   some ponies an' that's... ?

                            little bill
                         (approaching her)
                   ain't you seen enough blood for
                   one night?  hell, alice, they
                   ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad
                   men.  they're hard workin' boys
                   that was foolish.  why if they was
                   given over to wickedness in a
                   regular way...

                               alice
                             (furious)
                   like whores?

                              skinny
                   alice, tend to delilah.

     for a long moment alice just stands there glaring.
