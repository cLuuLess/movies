     int. railroad coach - day

     the headline on the newspaper says "president garfield
     wounded."  fuzzy, a cowboy, is sitting in the rocking coach
     reading the paper with great effort, partly because of the
     motion of the train and partly because fuzzy can't read very
     well... but crocker, the rough looking cowboy on the seat
     next to him can't read at all.

                              crocker
                   all i want to know is what sonof-
                   abitch shot him, that's all.  was
                   it one of them john bull assholes?

     across the aisle two well dressed gentlemen are sitting.
     the one by the window, the lean one in the frock coat and
     slouch hat, is ww beauchamp and the one on the aisle, pudgy,
     pinkcheeked, with neat muttonchop whiskers, wearing a frock
     coat and waistcoat and a silk slouch hat in spite of the
     heat, is english bob.  english bob has beady blue eyes, is
     about thirty-five and pulls constantly on a good cigar.

                            english bob
                     (in a rich english accent)
                   no, sir, i believe the would-be
                   murderer is a gentleman of french
                   ancestry... or so it would seem.
                   i hope i won't give offense if i
                   observe that the french are known
                   to be a race of assassins, though
                   they can't shoot worth a
                   damn...any frenchman among the
                   present company excluded of
                   course.

     crocker, not liking or understanding the interruption, gives
     english bob a hard stare.

                               fuzzy
                            (to crocker)
                   says here a fellow by the name of
                   "gitto."   "g-u-i--t..."

                              crocker
                           (eyes on bob)
                   sounds like a damn john bull to me.
                   "gitto."

     thirsty, a cowboy sitting behind crocker, turns in his seat,
     sensing the tension in the air and ww feels it too and
     shifts uneasily... but english bob is unperturbed and he
     puffs cheerfully on his cigar.

                            english bob
                   well, sirs... again not wishing to
                   give offense... it might be a good
                   idea if the country were to choose
                   a queen... or even a king
                   ...rather than a president.  one
                   isn't as quick to take a shot at a
                   king or a queen.  the majesty of
                   royalty, you see...

                              crocker
                           (provocative)
                   maybe you don't wish to give
                   offense, sir, but you are givin'
                   it pretty thick.  this country
                   don't need no queens whatsoever, i
                   guess.

     crocker is shifting in his seat so that the revolver in his
     holster is prominent and there is uneasy stirring among the
     nearby passengers.  a drummer looks around for exits.

                              crocker
                   as a matter of fact, what i
                   heard about queens...

                              thurston
                   shut up, joe.

                              crocker
                           (to thurston)
                   huh?  what's got up your ass,
                   thirsty?  this dude asshole...

                              thurston
                         (to crocker, but
                          his eyes on bob)
                   might be the "dude" is english bob
                   ...the one who works for the union
                   pacific shootin' chinamen.  might
                   be he wants for some dumb cowboy
                   to touch his pistol...  so's he
                   can shoot him down.

     english bob, unperturbed, just pulls on his cigar.

                              crocker
                             (sobered)
                   that a fact, mister?  you english
                   bob?

                            english bob
                             (affably)
                   why don't we shoot some turkeys,
                   friend?  ten shots... a dollar
                   a turkey.   i'll shoot for the
                   queen, and you can shoot for...
                   whomever.
