     ext. open country - day

     open country under a hot sun and munny and ned riding their
     horses at a walk and the saddles creaking and birds chirping
     in the five foot high grass.  it is late morning in northern
     kansas and they have been riding since dawn, mostly in
     silence, but ned has something on his mind and he glances at
     munny and frowns and then finally he blurts his question.

                                ned
                   say, bill... you ever... ever
                   go into town... an' all?

                               munny
                         (surprised at the
                             question)
                   sure, i got to.  got to get supplies.

                                ned
                   no.  i mean...
                           (embarrassed)
                   ...an' get yourself a woman?
                   you know?

     munny looks away quickly, embarrassed, and it seems like he
     isn't going to answer and then, when he finally does, he
     keeps his eyes on the horizon.

                               munny
                   naw.  naw, i don't ever go into
                   town for that.
                              (pause)
                   a man like me... a man like me
                   can't get no woman but one he's
                   gonna pay for... an' that ain't
                   right... buyin' flesh.
                          (looking at ned)
                   claudia, god rest her soul, she
                   wouldn't have wanted me doin'
                   nothin' like that, me bein' a
                   father, an' all.
                       (he looks away again)

                                ned
                           (rhetorically)
                   whaddaya do, just use your hand?

                               munny
                         (after a nervous
                           glance at ned)
                   sometimes... yeah.
                          (looking at the
                              horizon)
                   i don't miss it all that much.

     ned is shaking his head, wondering at the transformation of
     his old friend when...

     crack!  a rifle shot and the albino mare rears violently,
     whinnying and hurling munny out of the saddle and...

     ned's roan bolts at full speed, ned barely staying aboard.

     crack! another shot.

     view on munny

     on all fours in the tall grass.  he feels his forehead and
     wipes away a little blood, and shakes his head to clear it.
     then he hears rustling in the long grass and he whirls and
     pulls the starr out of his belt and sitting back he aims at
     where he heard the noise and he pulls back the hammer with a
     loud click.

                            ned's voice
                            (a whisper)
                   billy.  billy.

                               munny
                       (lowering the pistol,
                             relieved)
                   yeah.

     ned crawls out of the grass next to munny.

                                ned
                   some fucker's shootin' at us.

                               munny
                   yeah.

                                ned
                      (alarmed, seeing blood)
                   he hit you?

                               munny
                   naw.  i bumped my head fallin'
                   off of my horse.

     crack, another shot.  ned looks puzzled and he lifts his
     head up and tries to look around without exposing himself.

     a hundred yards away ned can see a clump of four or five
     trees and there is a little cloud of black smoke still
     hanging in the air there and then a sudden flash of fire,
     smoke and crack!

     ned doesn't even duck, he just frowns.

                                ned
                   he ain't shootin' our way no more.
                       (indicating the left)
                   he's shootin' over that way.  who's
                   he shootin' at over that way?

                               munny
                   beats the hell out of me.

                                ned
                   you suppose maybe we're in
                   somebody's field?

                               munny
                   i didn't see nothin' planted.

     crack.  another shot.  ned ducks urgently.

                                ned
                   fuck, he's shootin' at us again.

     crack, crack, crack.

                                ned
                   jesus, he's shootin' up the
                   whole fucking horizon.

     munny is thinkinh about it, has an idea, weighs it and gives
     it a try.

                               munny
                            (shouting)
                   hey.

                                ned
                   you're marking us, bill.

                               munny
                          (ignoring him)
                   hey, kid.

                                ned
                   kid?  the kid's shootin at us?

                               munny
                   is that you, kid?

                                ned
                   why would the kid shoot at us?

                               munny
                   hey kid, it's me, bill munny.
