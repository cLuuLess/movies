     close on munny and he is sweating.

                               munny
                   how many shots i got, ned?

     ned is sitting there dazed, staring vacantly.  bang, bang,
     bang, return fire pings off the rocks.

                               munny
                              (aiming)
                   how many left goddamit?

                                ned
                   two.

     and looking down the rifle munny can see davey's head
     disappear behind the boulder and crack, munny fires again.

                              the kid
                   did you get him?

     bang bang bang the pistol fire.

                   keep goin', davey.

     munny is cocking and aiming for his last shot and he can see
     davey's legs sticking out from the rock and they're not
     moving.

                              the kid
                   tell me... christ...

     crack, munny fires.
