     ext. woods - day

     the albino mare and the morgan in the woods and munny and
     the kid dash up to the horses, gasping for breath, and munny
     tries to mount still holding the shotgun and the horse
     starts to prance around and munny can't mount.

                               munny
                   hold still.

     bang, bang, bang shots are whistling around them and looking
     back munny can see his pursuers firing from cover fifty
     yards away.

     munny shoves two shells in the shotgun and hands it to the
     kid who has mounted.

                               munny
                   cover me, kid, while i mount.

                              the kid
                             (panicked)
                   i can't see 'em.

     bang bang bang

                               munny
                   just shoot!

     and ka blammm, the kid lets go both barrels in the general
     direction of the enemy and then munny gallops away half on
     his horse, half-off, in an undignified escape, bullets
     whistling around his horse and the kid behind him shouting.

                              the kid
                   where are you, bill, where are
                   you, i can't see you.  wait for me.

     and then they disappear and gradually the shooting atops.
