     ext. south end of town - night

     the south end of town, night, rain and the albino mare
     walking aimlessly with munny slumped in the saddle and then
     two riders come from between two shadowy buildings and it is
     the kid and ned and they come alongside munny, one on each
     side of him and ned lifts his slumped head up and looks at
     the battered face and winces and says with his eyes what the
     kid says with his tongue.

                              the kid
                   oh, jesus.  oh, jesus.
