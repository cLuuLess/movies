     ext. sod hut - day

     the albino mare snorting and shying, anxious to lose the
     saddle.  will has her by the halter, holding her with
     effort, in front of the house.

                               will
                   she ain't hardly a saddle horse no
                   more, paw.  she ain't used to the
                   feel.

     munny walks up and puts his hand on penny's head fondly.

                               munny
                   them flowers, penny, i could
                   tell your maw liked them, hear?
                         (turning to will)
                   take care of your sister, son.
                   you can kill three chickens if
                   you need, not no more.  keep
                   the hogs that got fever
                   separate if you can.  an' if
                   you need help, go see sally two-
                   trees over to ned logan's.

     then he turns to the mare and shoves a foot in the stirrup
     to mount but the horse shies and munny goes down in the dust
     looking very undignified.

     and penny is horrified and humiliated for her father whom
     she worships and will's eyes are big because munny's coat
     came open and he caught a quick glimpse of the starr pistol
     stuck in the waist band.

                               munny
                      (brushing himself off,
                            embarrassed)
                   ain't felt a saddle in a while
                   myself.

     then munny has one foot in the stirrup and the horse starts
     to shy and munny has to hop around with one foot stirruped
     and the other not... and when he tries to swing aboard he
     falls back...

                               munny
                   easy old gal, easy...

     and he still can't make it, so to cover his embarrassment he
     talks to the kids while he hops around desperately trying to
     mount.

                               munny
                   now this here horse is gettin'
                   even on me... hold on gal... for
                   the sins of my youth... in my
                   youth... before i met... your
                   dear departed mother... i was
                   weak an' givin' to mistreatin'
                   horses an' such.  an' this here
                   horse... an' that ole pig, too,
                   i guess... is my comeuppance for
                   my cruelty...

     at last he is in the saddle and takes a deep breath.

                               munny
                   used to be i could cuss an' hurt
                   an animal... til your departed
                   mother, god rest her, showed me the
                   error of my ways.

     munny turns the albino mare and starts out the gate going
     weat toward the fields.

                               munny
                        (over his shoulder)
                   i won't be no longer than a couple
                   of weeks.  remember how the spirit
                   of your departed maw watches over
                   you.

     will and penny are watching him go and will is fighting back
     the tears but penny has lost the battle and she is crying
     and the horse whinnies.

     view on munny

     twenty yards away getting up off the ground and trying to
     catch the shying, prancing horse on foot, his dignity a
     shambles.
