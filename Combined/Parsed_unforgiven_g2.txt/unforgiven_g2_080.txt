     ext. boulders - day

     munny sitting there, his back against the rock, staring
     vacantly and ned looks the same.

                              the kid
                            (derisively)
                   them assholes can't hit us up
                   here.  just wastin' bullets.

     the cowboys must realize that because they stop shooting and
     you can hear davey moaning and ned and munny just sit there
     and sweat and the kid is pacing up and down.

                              the kid
                   you think he's gonna die?  you
                   think we killed him?

     ned and munny look into each other's eyes.

                         davey's voice o.s.
                   help me, boys, help me...

                               munny
                              (flatly)
                   yup... we killed him, i guess.

                         davey's voice o.s.
                   oh, jesus, help me boys, i don't
                   want to die... i don't want to die.

                              the kid
                        (rattled, shouting)
                   shouldn't of cut up no woman,
                   you asshole.
