     davey is lying there behind the boulder drenched in blood,
     looking up at the blazing noonday sun.

                               davey
                             (shouting)
                   i'm dyin', boys.

     he pauses then, and then he speaks in a normal voice, as
     though to himself, to express his amazement, to test

                               davey
                   i'm dyin'.
                              (pause)
                   i'm dyin'.
                        (shouting, panicked)
                   boys, i'm dyin'!
