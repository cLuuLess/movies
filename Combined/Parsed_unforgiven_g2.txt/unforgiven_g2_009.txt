     ext. sod hut - day

     will and penny in front of the house, looking up at the kid
     who is mounted again and munny is standing there taking
     leave of the kid.

                              the kid
                   don't tell nobody about the
                   reward an' all.  don't need no
                   other gunmen tryin' to collect.

                               munny
                   i don't never see nobody anyhow.

                              the kid
                           (riding away)
                   if you was to change your mind,
                   might be you could catch me...
                   due west to the western trail
                   an' north to ogallala.

     munny waves at the kid and for a long moment watches him
     trot across the flat, grassy fields.  then he turns back to
     his shabby farm and the squealing pigs and the two children
     who are looking up at him.

                               will
                   who's he?

                               munny
                          (turning away)
                   best we move that pig.
