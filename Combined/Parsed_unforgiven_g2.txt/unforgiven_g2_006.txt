     int. delilah's room - day

     daylight and a basin of bloody water and little sue is just
     dipping another towel in the hot water next to delilah's
     bed, changing the bandages.   all the whores are there in
     various states of dress, lounging on the floor, leaning
     against the wall.

                               silky
                             (to alice)
                   if delilah don't care one way or
                   the other, what're you so riled
                   about?

                               alice
                           (passionately)
                   just because them smelly assholes
                   like to ride us like horses don't
                   mean we got to let 'em brand us
                   like we're horses.  maybe we ain't
                   nothin' but whores, but by god we
                   ain't horses.

     silky is thinking it over, frowning, and then she makes her
     decision.

                               silky
                             (to alice)
                   i got a hundred an' twelve dollars.
                   that's everythin'.

                               alice
                   what about you, faith?

                               faith
                           (reluctantly)
                   two hundred...
                         (there are gasps)
                   two hundred an' forty.

                               alice
                             (laughing)
                   jesus, faith, what you been doin',
                   givin' skinny somethin' special?

     all the women laugh and delilah through her bandages makes a
     gurgling sound and little sue's eyes light up.

                             little sue
                        (indicating delilah)
                   she laughed.

                               alice
                   with what kate got, silky got some,
                   an' mine, an' little s...

                               silky
                             (soberly)
                   it ain't enough.

                               alice
                            (determined)
                   not yet maybe.
