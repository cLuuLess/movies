     ext. stream bed - day

     a dry stream bed and the three men are riding single file
     now with the kid in the lead but ned has been thinking and,
     trotting with his horse, he pulls alongside the kid.

                                ned
                   you was right to change your mind,
                   kid.

                              the kid
                        (surly, suspicious)
                   yeah?

                                ned
                             (proudly)
                   i'm a damn good shot.
                            (looking up)
                   see that hawk up there?  i could
                   kill that hawk with one shot.

     view on the empty sky.  there isn't any hawk.

     view on munny who is right beside them is looking up and he
     doesn't see any hawk and he looks at ned like he thought ned
     was crazy and he frowns.

     the kid just looks up and squints and looks ahead at the
     trail and keeps riding.

                              the kid
                   hell, i could hit it too if i
                   didn't mind wasting a shot.

     and munny looks up again, amazed, because they must be
     crazy, both of them.

     and ned reins his horse hard.

                                ned
                   there ain't no hawk up there,
                   kid.

     and the kid reins and turns and he locks eyes with ned.  he
     knows he's been found out.

                                ned
                   can't see worth a shit, can you?

     the kid is furious, his eyes flick around and he spots
     something and he pulls out the schofield.

                              the kid
                   see them fucking turtles?

     view on three turtles

     making their way up the stream bed ten yards away.

     view on the kid

     his schofield spitting fire and smoke blam, blam.

     view on the turtle

     blam, the third turtle exploding and following the other two
     to oblivion.

     view on the men

                               munny
                            (impressed)
                   shit.

                                ned
                    (impressed but holding back)
                   how far kin you see?

                              the kid
                   far enough.

                                ned
                   we ain't goin' to nebraska on
                   no turtle hunt.  a hundred yards?

                              the kid
                   more.

                                ned
                             (testing)
                   see that scrub oak yonder?

                              the kid
                             (furious)
                   fuck you.

                                ned
                             (to munny)
                   he's blind, for chri...

                              the kid
                       (pointing his pistol
                              at ned)
                   i ain't blind, you asshole.

                               munny
                   now hold on, boys, hold on.  now,
                   kid, you kin see fifty yards,
                   can't you?

                              the kid
                   bet your ass i kin see fifty yards
                   an' i kin shoot this sonofabitch...

                               munny
                   easy, kid, easy.
                     (looking ned in the eye)
                   now, you hear that, ned?  the kid
                   can see fifty yards fine, hear?

                                ned
                        (under his breath)
                   jesus.

                               munny
                   fifty yards ain't bad.
                     (glancing at the horizon)
                   guess we better get along.
