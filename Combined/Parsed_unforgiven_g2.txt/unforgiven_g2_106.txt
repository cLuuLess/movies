     huge pile of straw.

                               munny
                             (worried)

                   didn't... didn't come back in a
                   week...

     and will has exposed the saddle bags and munny moves in and
     opens them and gold coins and wads of bills spill out.

                   shotgun an' that pistol an'...

                               munny
                        (bothered, putting
                          his arm around
                         will's shoulders)
                   before i met your maw, god rest
                   her soul, it used to be i was
                   kinda... wicked... drinkin'
                   spirits an' gettin' into scrapes
                   an' all.  only she made me see the
                   error of my ways an'... i ain't

                               will
                            (relieved)
                   i guess you didn't kill nobody
                   then.

                               munny
                         (it is an effort)
