     ext. camp - night

     night and the sizzling campfire as ned empties the grease
     from the frying pan into the fire.

     munny is already lying down, fussing in his blankets to get
     comfortable and the crickets are chirping up a storm.

                               munny
                   got used to my bed.  ain't gonna
                   feel to home out here.

                                ned
                    (getting into his blankets)
                   well, it ain't just the bed i'm gonna
                   miss.  i'm...
                        (he stops suddenly)
                   hell, billy, i'm sorry.  i didn't
                   mean...

                               munny
                   it ain't nothin', don't fret it.
                              (pause)
                   she don't like it much, you goin'
                   off with me.

                                ned
                   sally?

                               munny
                   she gave me the evil eye.

                                ned
                   it's just... she's a indian an'
                   indians ain't... overfriendly.

                               munny
                   i ain't blamin' her, ned, i ain't
                   holdin' it against her.
                              (pause)
                   she knew me back then... an' she seen
                   what a no good sonofabitch i was...
                   an' she won't allow how i've changed.
                   she just don't know how i ain't like
                   that no more.

                                ned
                   well, she...

                               munny
                            (urgently)
                   i ain't the same, ned.  claudia,
                   she... straightened me up, got me
                   clear of the whiskey an' all.  us
                   goin' to do this killin'... that
                   don't mean i'm back to like i was.
                   i just need the money... for a new
                   start... for them youngsters.
                           (long pause)
                   remember that drover, the one i
                   shot in the mouth so's the teeth
                   come out the back of his head?  i
                   dream about him now an' again.  i
                   didn't have no reason to shoot
                   him... not one i could remember
                   when i sobered up.

                                ned
                   you was a... a crazy sonofabitch.

                               munny
                   nobody liked me... none of the
                   boys.  they was scared of me...
                   figured i might shoot 'em out of
                   pure meanness.

                                ned
                   you ain't like that no more.

                               munny
                   eagle... he hated my guts.
                   bonaparte didn't like me none.

                                ned
                   nor quincy, i guess.

                               munny
                   quincy, he was always watchin' me.
                   scared.

                                ned
                   you ain't like that no more.

                               munny
                   hell, no.  i'm just a fella now.
                   ain't no different from anyone else
                   no more.

     after a pause, ned rolls over to go to sleep and says
     something kind by way of saying goodnight.

                                ned
                   hell, bill, i always liked you...
                   even back then.

     ned settles in his covers and so does munny and the crickets
     chirp for a long moment but munny can't sleep with the lie.

                               munny
                   no you didn't.  you wasn't no
                   different, ned.
                            (and we...)
