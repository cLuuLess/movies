     int. sod hut - day

     munny selects a tin cup from a wash pan of dirty dishes.  it
     is dark and cool inside his one room sod hut... and poor.

     the kid checks one of the three chairs for stability before
     sitting down.

                               munny
                   you're pete sothow's nephew, huh?
                   hell, i thought maybe you was
                   someone come to kill me...
                       (he has the cups and
                      he crosses to the fire)
                   ...for somethin' i done in the
                   old days.

                              the kid
                             (sitting)
                   i could of... easy.

                               munny
                   yeah, i guess so.

                              the kid
                   like i was sayin' you don't look
                   like no meaner than hell cold-
                   blooded damn killer.

                               munny
                   maybe i ain't.

                              the kid
                   well, uncle pete said you was the
                   goddamndest meanest sonofabitch
                   ever lived an' if i ever wanted a
                   partner for a killin', you was the
                   worst one.  meanin' the best.  on
                   account of you're cold as snow an'
                   don't have no weak nerve nor fear.

     munny serves the coffee gloomily and sits down.  it appears
     his feelings are hurt but the kid doesn't notices.

                               munny
                   he said that, huh?

                              the kid
                   i'm a damn killer myself, only i
                   ain't killed so many as you because
                   of my youth.  schofield kid, they
                   call me.

                               munny
                   schofield?  you from schofield?

                              the kid
                    (laying his smith & wesson
                    schofield .45 on the table)
                   on account of my schofield model
                   smith and wesson pistol.

                               munny
                   oh.

                              the kid
                   well, how about it?

                               munny
                   about what?

                              the kid
                   bein' my partner.   i'm headin' north
                   up around the niobrara in nebraska.
                   gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.

                               munny
                   what for?

                              the kid
                   for cuttin' up a lady.   they cut up
                   her face an' cut her eyes out, cut
                   her ears off an' her tits too.

                               munny
                            (horrified)
                   jesus!

                              the kid
                         (pleased with the
                             reaction)
                   thousand dollars of reward.  five
                   hundred a piece.

                               will
                   paw, i can't move that damn pig.

     will has slipped into the house with penny in tow and they
     are both covered with mud and will is swearing toshow off
     to the stranger.

                               munny
                           (embarrassed)
                   no cussin' now, will.   go on out
                   the pump an' clean up some an' i'll
                   be along.   check them other pens.

     the two kids back out the door, eyes on the pistol and the
     stranger, and munny walks over near the beds with his back
     to the kid.

                               munny
                   i ain't like that no more, kid.
                   whiskey done it as much as anythin'
                   i guess.
                        (turning to the kid)
                   i ain't touched a drop in ten years.
                   my wife, she cured me of it...
                   cured me of drink an' wickedness.

                              the kid
                   well... you don't look so prosper-
                   ous.  hell, you could buy her a new
                   dress out of your half.  we could
                   kill them two an' you could buy
                   your wife one of them fancy...

                               munny
                   she's passed on, kid.

                              the kid
                   huh?

                               munny
                   been gone near three years now.

                              the kid
                        (staring stupidly)
                   oh.
