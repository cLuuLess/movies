     int. alice's room - night

     night in alice's room.  a little bit of moonlight coming in
     through the tiny window might make a highlight here and
     there but that's about all.  words begin to crawl across the
     screen:

                       written words (crawl)
                   of good family, albeit one of
                   modest means, she was a comely
                   young woman and not without
                   prospects.  therefore it was at
                   once heartbreaking and astonishing
                   to her mother that she would enter
                   into marriage with william munny, a
                   known thief and murderer, a man of
                   notoriously vicious and intemperate
                   disposition.

     we can hear strawberry alice and davey bunting breathing
     heavily and the bed creaking.

                       written words (crawl)
                   they were married in st. louis in
                   1870 and they traveled north to
                   kansas where he engaged in farming
                   and swine husbandry.

     davey and alice are picking up speed now, breathing faster
     and even snorting a little, and it's cold as jesus in
     nebraska in the winter so when the blanket slips, alice
     snarls and gasps.

                               alice
                   the blanket, for chrissake,
                   cowboy, the blanket.

     there are six of these little rooms... one for each whore...
     behind greely's beer garden and billiards and the walls are
     just boards so you can hear what's happening in the other
     rooms and right now, from delilah's room, you can hear a
     high-pitched, merry little giggle and that's important.

                    written words (crawl contd.)
                   she bore him two children in the
                   eight years of their marriage and
                   when she died, it was not at his
                   hands as her mother might have
                   expected, but of smallpox.  that
                   was in 1878.

                        delilah's voice o.s.
                   no, please.... no, no goddamn you.

     alice and davey have stopped fucking and started listening
     but they don't move.

                           written words
                          (crawl cont'd)
                   it wasn't until 1881... three
                   yeats later... that a cowboy named
                   mike cut up a whore in big
                   whiskey, nebraska in the niobrara
                   river country.
                            (end crawl)

                         mike's voice o.s.
                   davey, come a runnin' lad an'
                   hold the thieving cunt...

     a blur of action as davey leaps from the bed and dashes out
     of the room naked...

                         mike's voice o.s.
                   ...brand you like a damn steer,
                   bitch...

     and alice is right behind him, wrapping herself in a blanket
     as she goes.
