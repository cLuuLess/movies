     int. bunkhouse - day

     view on buck coming into the bunkhouse.  there isn't much
     light and the shadowy sleeping figures are more easily
     discernable by the snorts and snores they make than by their
     shapes...  except for thirsty and quick mike who are
     sitting, half dressed at a table rolling cigarettes.

                              thirsty
                   see anythin' out there, buck?

                               buck
                   hell, yes i did.
                     (mike looks up nervously)
                   seen about two hundred fellers
                   packin' rifles... fuckers got the
                   place surrounded, says they want
                   quick mike's ass... i says, "how
                   much?"  they says, "about five."
                   i says, "dollars?" they says,
                   "cents."  i says, "sold."

                               mike
                   well i ain't worried i got
                   protection.
                    (he indicates a nearby bunk)

     fatty snoring on the bunk near quick mike.
