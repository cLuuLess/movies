     ext. little bill's house - day

     view on hot sun blazing down.

     bang bang bang, hammer on nail and the fingers holding the
     nail are swollen and purple and then... whup hammer on
     flesh.

                            little bill
                   oh, shit, shit an' damn, oh fuck
                   my mother and my father, o damn an'
                   jesus.

     little bill is hopping around in his hat and boots and
     nothing else in front of his brand new one story, four room,
     frame house that hasn't been painted it's so new and doesn't
     have a porch yet, though that is being begun... sort of.  in
     fact... the house doesn't look quite right... looks a little
     lopsided.

     skinny dubois is standing there, in the clearing wiping his
     brow and catching his breath and watching little bill.

                               skinny
                   hit your finger, huh?

                            little bill
                            (surprised)
                   huh?  hullo, skinny.  snuck up on
                   me.
                   (indicating the house proudly)
                   how do you like her?

                               skinny
                        (looking critically)
                   heard you done the roof yourself.

                            little bill
                   roof?  jesus, skinny, i done
                   practically every damn thing
                   myself.  roberts boy hauled
                   wood, that's all.

                               skinny
                   what's all that wood?

                            little bill
                        (enthusiastically)
                   porch.  i'm puttin' a porch on
                   her so's i can puff my pipe of
                   an evening an' drink my coffee
                   an' watch the sun set.

     little bill is back at it, hauling a four by six into
     position.

                            little bill
                        (over his shoulder,
                             proudly)
                   you come clear up here just to
                   get a look at her?

     the train whistle screams loudly below in the valley and
     turning nervously, skinny can see a puff of steam above the
     distant trees.

                               skinny
                   them whores...
                       (he pauses, reluctant
                             to go on)

     little bill isn't really paying attention to anything but
     his house.

                            little bill
                   yeah?

                               skinny
                   them whores, they been fuckin'
                   an' fuckin' all them cowboys
                   that come into town the last
                   two weeks...

                            little bill
                            (chuckling)
                   shit, skinny, we got railroad barons
                   an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna
                   be the first of the billiard barons.

                               skinny
                           (ignoring him)
                   ...they been fuckin' 'em, 'an
                   tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em
                   how they're payin' a thousand dollars
                   to whatever sonofabitch kills them
                   two boys which cut up delilah.

     little bill drops the board he's holding up and turns
     sharply to skinny.  down in the valley the train whistle
     screams and after a long, tense moment, little bill turns
     and looks out over the valley, frowning.

                            little bill
                   an' all them cowboys been riding
                   that beef down to kansas an'
                   cheyenne?

                               skinny
                   (unhappily, dropping his eyes)
                   yup.

                            little bill
                   all week?

                               skinny
                          (apologetically)
                   i didn't hear nothin' till last
                   night.

                            little bill
                   word must have got all the
                   way to texas by now.

                               skinny
                             (quickly)
                   oh, shit, bill, i guess nobody's
                   gonna come clear from texas.

                            little bill
                          (sitting down)
                   they really got all that money,
                   them whores?

                               skinny
                       (sitting beside bill)
                   you know how women kin lie... i
                   knock 'em around a little, ask 'em
                   where the money is, they say they
                   don't have none?...but they
                   coulda squirreled away that much,
                   the five of 'em.  maybe.
                              (pause)

                            little bill
                   that much, huh?

                               skinny
                             (hopeful)
                   you could run off them two cowboys.

                            little bill
                             (sharply)
                   i could run off them whores.

                               skinny
                          (after a pause)
                   well, i guess they'll just up an'
                   run anyhow, them two.

                            little bill
                             (glumly)
                   nope.  they'll stay out on the
                   spade country where they got
                   friends.

     the train whistle screams down in the valley and the train
     is chugging in the distance, pulling out, headed south.

                               skinny
                   shit, bill, could be nobody
                   won't come at all.
