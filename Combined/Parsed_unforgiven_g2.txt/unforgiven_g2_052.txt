     int. alice's room - night

     alice's room at night, the sound of rain beating hard on the
     roof.  alice is playing cards with silky and faith when
     little sue sticks her head in the door.

                             little sue
                   a fella's askin' for you, alice.

                               alice
                   tonight?  you ain't joshin'?

                             little sue
                        (looking behind her)
                   this way, mister.

     silky and faith pick up the cards to leave.

                               alice
                   must be randy as hell to come
                   out in this shit.

     and then they look up because a water soaked young man with
     very few front teeth and a ragged stubble is standing in the
     doorway squinting.  it is the kid.
