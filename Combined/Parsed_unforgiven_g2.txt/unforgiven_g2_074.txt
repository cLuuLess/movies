     munny, the rifle at his cheek and the kid leaning
     frantically over his shoulder, trying to see.

                               munny
                   shit!

                              the kid
                   what happened, did you hit him?

     bang!  bang!  pistol shots from below and the bullets
     ping harmlessly among the rocks.

                              the kid
                   they're shootin' at us.

                        johnny's voice o.s.
                   we'll kill you, you assholes.

     munny is aiming, he can see davey, nearer shelter now.
     crack!  he fires and sees the dust spurt near davey.

                         lippy's voice o.s.
                   you assholes... you stinking
                   ambushing assholes.

                              the kid
                   did you get him?  where is he?
