     ext. outhouse - day

     view on the mid day sun blazing from on high and an enormous
     farting sound...

     view on the outhouse

     after a pause, another vigorous fart and then silence broken
     only by the buzzing of flies, and then the sound of
     newspaper and suddenly the door opens and thirsty steps out
     and heads up toward the bunkhouse.

     view on the kid

     in the bushes reacting to the smell and the flies are
     buzzing furiously.

                              the kid
                   sure is fuckin' ripe.  i wish
                   we'd get a breeze.

     munny wipes sweat from his face and looks up at the blazing
     sun.

                               munny
                   it's gonna get riper yet.

                              the kid
                   you still think he's in there?

                               munny
                          (his eyes on the
                             bunkhouse)
                   yeah, he's in there.

                              the kid
                   well, he's holding on to his
                   shit like it was money.

                               munny
                   he's in there.

                              the kid
                   tell me right off if you see
                   him.

                               munny
                   yup.

                              the kid
                   you... you ain't gonna shoot him
                   yourownself?

                               munny
                        (tired of saying it)
                   you can shoot him.

     the kid nods, satisfied, but he's keyed up something
     ferocious and his fingers play nervously with his pistol.
