     int. shed - night

     candlelight, ned and the kid, and ned is sewing munny's face
     with a needle and thread.

                                ned
                   hold him, dammit.

     it is some sort of straw-filled shed and they have stuck a
     candle on a board.

                              the kid
                             (sickened)
                   jesus.
                              (pause)
                   you done this before?

                                ned
                             (working)
                   plenty of times.

     munny is only semi-conscious and the kid is holding his face
     still.

                              the kid
                   his pistol must of jammed.

                                ned
                   move the candle closer, i can't see.

                              the kid
                   he wouldn't of took no beating like
                   that if it hadn't of jammed.  he
                   wouldn't just give it over an' not
                   shoot no one.
