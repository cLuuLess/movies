     ext. main street/greely's - night

     the street and it is dark and quiet, shadowy buildings, the
     knot of tethered horses, a couple of torches stuck in the
     ground sputtering.

                         munny's voice o.s.
                   nobody better shoot on account of
                   i'm as mean as i say... maybe
                   meaner.  i am a damn badman an'
                   you will not find a worse one in
                   hell.

     and munny steps out the door warily, and looks around and all
     he sees are the shadowy buildings and all he hears are his
     own boots on the wooden porch.  glancing nervously at the
     dark buildings' blank stares he walks past the upright
     coffin where the waxy face of ned stares gruesomely in the
     light of the flickering torch and he gives it a glance,
     wanting to say he's sorry, but the idea is ludicrous and he
     steps off the porch and walks toward the white mare.
