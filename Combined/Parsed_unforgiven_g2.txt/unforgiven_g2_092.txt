     close on cards.  they are playing at the little table in the
     bunkhouse, quick mike, buck, thirsty, fatty rossiter and
     olaf harken and quick mike doesn't even have a pair and
     tosses his cards down in disgust and walks over to his bunk
     and starts to put on his boots.

                                buck
                             (to mike)
                   where you goin'?

                             quick mike
                   take a shit.

                               fatty
                         (he has two kings)
                   lemmee finish this hand, will
                   you?

                             quick mike
                   you gonna protect me while i
                   take a shit?

     quick mike walks over to a peg and hangs a gunbelt over his
     bare shoulder.

                                buck
                   you could get bushwhacked.

                             quick mike
                       (heading for the door)

                        (starting to get up)
                   i'll go with him.

                             quick mike
                   you could wipe my ass, thirsty.

                              thirsty
                           (sitting down)
                   hell with him.  man ain't polite,
                   he oughta get shot.
