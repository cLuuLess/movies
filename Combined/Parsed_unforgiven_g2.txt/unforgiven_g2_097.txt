     ext. open country - day

     open country at sundown seen from a low hill, and you can
     barely make out a lone rider approaching in the extreme
     distance.

     view on munny

     standing on the rise and watching the rider in the distance.

                              the kid
                   is that what it was like, bill, in
                   the old days... ridin' out with
                   everybody shootin'... smoke all
                   over an' folks yellin' an' bullets
                   whizzin' by?

     the kis is behind bill sitting under a large oak drinking
     from a whiskey bottle.

                               munny
                             (absently)
                   yeah, i guess so.

                              the kid
                   shit... i thought they was gonna
                   get us.  i was even... scared a
                   little... just for a minute.
                              (pause)
                   was you ever scared in them days?

     munny turns from watching the rider's slow approach and
     walks over to the kid who can't see the rider from where
     he's sitting.

                               munny
                   i don't remember, kid.  i was
                   drunk most of the time.  give me a
                   pull on that bottle, will you?

     munny takes a big pull on the bottle, returns it to the kid,
     and walks back to the edge of the rise to resume his vigil.

     the rider is a little closer now and the sun is a little
     lower.  it is very beautiful.

                              the kid
                          (drinking heavy)
                   i shot that fucker three times.
                   he was takin' a shit.  he went for
                   his pistol an' i blazed away...
                   first shot got him in the chest...

     the kid wipes whiskey from his chin.  he has been working
     hard to make the hysteria he feels into a high... but it
     won't quite come.

                              the kid
                   say, bill...

                               munny
                   yeah.

     munny is watching the rider and the rider is closer.

                              the kid
                   that was... the first one.

                               munny
                   first one what?

                              the kid
                   first one i ever killed.

                               munny
                         (preoccupied with
                             his vigil)
                   yeah?

                              the kid
                   how i said i shot five men...
                   it wasn't true.
                            (long pause)
                   that mexican... the one that come
                   at me with a knife... i busted his
                   leg with a shovel... i didn't
                   shoot him or nothin'.

     munny is watching the rider and the rider is much closer but
     coming at a walk and munny goes back over to the kid for a
     pull on the bottle and he's trying to make the kid feel okay
     when he says...

                               munny
                   well, that fella today, you shot
                   him alright.

                              the kid
                          (forced bravado)
                   h-hell yeah.  i killed the hell
                   out of him... three shots... he
                   was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'...
                   an'...

     the kid is shaking, becoming hysterical, he can't go on, and
     munny hands the bottle back.

                               munny
                   take a drink, kid.

                              the kid
                      (breaking down, crying)
                   oh ch-ch-christ... it don't... it
                   don't seem... real... how he's...
                   dead... how he ain't gonna breathe
                   no more... n-n-never.  or the
                   other one neither... on account
                   of... of just... pullin' a
                   trigger.

     munny walks back to the edge of the rise and watches the
     rider and it is a lovely sunset happening and he is talking
     to no one in particular.

                               munny
                   it's a hell of a thing, ain't it,
                   killin' a man.  you take
                   everythin' he's got... an'
                   everythin' he's ever gonna have...

                              the kid
                        (trying to pull him-
                           self together)
                   well, i gu-guess they had it...
                   comin'.

                               munny
                   we all got it comin', kid.

     view on the rider at the foot of the rise and it is little
     sue and

     view on munny pulling the saddle bags off and little sue is
     still mounted.  they are under the oak tree and it is dusk
     and the kid is just sitting there with his bottle.

                               munny
                   i was watchin' you... seein' if
                   you was followed.

                            little sue
                         (scared to death)
                   silky an' faith, they rode off to
                   the east an' two deputies was
                   followin' them.

     munny has lit a little candle and spread a blanket and he is
     opening the bags to count the money.

                               munny
                          (pouring out the
                          coins and bills)
                   you wanna help me count, kid?

     the kid is leaning against the tree in a semi-stupor.

                              the kid
                   i trust you, bill.

                               munny
                   well, you don't wanna trust me too
                   much.  we'll take ned his share
                   together so you don't figure i run
                   off with it.

                            little sue
                            (startled)
                   ned's share?

                               munny
                             (counting)
                   yeah, he went south ahead of us.
                   i guess we'll catch him before...

                            little sue
                         (blurting it out)
                   he's... he's dead.

                               munny
                             (counting)
                   no he ain't.  he went south
                   yesterday.

                            little sue
                   they... they killed him.  i...
                   thought you know that.  i thought
                   you knew because...

                               munny
                            (looking up)
                   nobody didn't kill ned, he went
                   south yesterday.  he didn't even
                   kill nobody.  why would anybody
                   kill ned?

     little sue just looks back at him, scared, trembling.

                               munny
                            (realizing)
                   who killed him?

                            little sue
                   little bill.  the... the bar t
                   boys caught him and little bill...

                               munny
                   he hanged him?
                      (little sue shakes her
                             head "no")
                   shot him down?

                            little sue
                   n-no.  he... he beat him up.  he
                   was making him... answer
                   questions... and beating him up...
                   and then... ned just died.
                              (pause)
                   little bill didn't mean to kill
                   him... he said he was sorry an'
                   all... but he said it was a good
                   example anyhow.

                               munny
                             (outraged)
                   good example!  good example of
                   what i'd like to know?  he didn't
                   even kill nobody... he couldn't do
                   it no more.

                            little sue
                   they got... a sign on him says
                   he was a killer.

                               munny
                          (flabbergasted)
                   a sign on him?

                            little sue
                   in front of greely's.  it says,
                   "this here is what happens to..."

                               munny
                           (incredulous)
                   they got a sign on him in front
                   of greely's?

     the kid just has his head in his hands, it's too much for
     him and little sue is scared shitless of munny.

                               munny
                   the questions little bill asked
                   him... what sort of questions
                   was they?

                            little sue
                   about where you an' him
                        (indicating the kid)
                   was... an' where you was from...
                   an' what your names was... an'...

                               munny
                   what'd ned say?

                            little sue
                   l-lies... at first.  about how you
                   was just passin' through and didn't
                   kill nobody... an' little bill kept
                   askin' questions, mixin' him up,
                   catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat
                   on ned an' ned would cry and lie
                   some more an' then... then...

                               munny
                   then... what?

                            little sue
                   a cowboy come in sayin' you killed
                   quick mike in the shit house at
                   the bar t...

                                munny
                   an' little bill killed ned for what
                   i done?

                            little sue
                   not on purpose.  but he started
                   hurtin' him worse... makin' him
                   tell stuff.  first ned wouldn't
                   say nothin'... but little bill
                   hurt him so bad he said who you
                   was...

     munny looks up sharply.  little sue is scared, her voice
     quavers...

                         little sue contd.
                   he said how you was really three
                   fingered jack out of missouri...
                   an' bill said "same three fingered
                   jack that dynamited the rock
                   island and pacific in '69 killin'
                   women and children an' all?"  an'
                   ned says you done a lot worse than
                   that, said you was more cold
                   blooded than william bonney or
                   clay alisson or the james brothers
                   an' how if he hurt ned again you
                   was gonna come an' kill him like
                   you killed a u.s. marshall in '73.

                               munny
                   didn't scare little bill though,
                   did it?

                            little sue
                   n-no, sir?

                               munny
                   lemmee see that schofield, kid.

                              the kid
                   wha... what f-for?

                               munny
                             (sharply)
                   lemmee see it.

                              the kid
                         (giving it to him)
                   sure.  sure, bill.

     munny takes the pistol and begins to check it methodically,
     inspecting the load first... and the kid watches nervously,
     shifting from foot to foot.

                              the kid
                   you... you could keep it, bill.
                   i ain't... gonna use it no more,
                   i ain't gonna kill nobody.

     munny, still checking the gun, glances up and meets the
     kid's uneasy gaze.

                              the kid
                   i... i ain't like you, bill.

     munny looks back at the pistol, checks the sights.

                              the kid
                   you... gonna take... the money?

                               munny
                          (to little sue)
                   you better get on back, miss.

     and little sue, still mounted, breathes an enormous silent
     sigh of relief and turns her horse away hastily and munny,
     satisfied with the pistol, sticks it in his belt and walks
     over to the horse and pulls his sawed-off shotgun out of the
     bedroll.

                              the kid
                   you could have it.  all of it.

                               munny
                   i thought you wanted to buy
                   spectacles an' fancy clothes an'
                   all.

                              the kid
                   i'd rather be blind and ragged
                   than dead, i guess.

     munny looks at the kid who is behaving bravely but is
     trembling anyway, scared, and munny's eyes are full of
     brutally painful memories.

                               munny
                   shit, kid.  i ain't gonna kill
                   you.  you're... the only friend
                   i got.
