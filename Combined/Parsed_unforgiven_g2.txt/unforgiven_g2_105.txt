     ext. hog pens - day

     view on will

     working in the hog pens in back, concentrating on the job.

                               munny
                   place looks good.

     and will whirls around and sees munny standing there beside
     the house and his first instinct is to run to him and then
     he remembers his dignity and stands there like a man, but
     the grin is liable to break his face.

                               will
                   hullo, paw.

                               munny
                   i guess you lost some hogs to
                   the fever.

                               will
                   three.

                               munny
                   three?  that ain't bad considerin'.

     will is pissing in his pants with pride and pleasure and he
     joins his father and they walk around the house together.

                               will
                   that fella come by... tom.

                               munny
                             (stopping)
                   tom?

                               will
                   the one you rode out after...
                   the one that had the pistol...

                               munny
                   the kid, yeah...

                               will
                   only he wasn't carryin' no pistol
                   this time.
