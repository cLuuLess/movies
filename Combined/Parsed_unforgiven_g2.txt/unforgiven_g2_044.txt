     ext. camp - night

     munny and ned lying near the campfire and the kid walks up
     and starts to fix his blankets.

     he looks at munny thoughtfully.  something's bothering him,
     and finally he blurts it out as he climbs into his own
     blankets.

                              the kid
                   say, bill.  that business in jackson
                   county... did that really happen?
                   i mean how they say it happened?

                               munny
                   what business?

                              the kid
                    (a frown, a pause, then...)
                   an' how there was two deputies up
                   close pointin' rifles at you...
                   had you dead to rights... an' how
                   you pulled out a pistol an' blew
                   them both away to hell...  an'
                   only took a scratch yourself.
                              (pause)
                   uncle pete told me he never seen
                   nothin' like it, shootin' your
                   way out of a scrape like that.

                               munny
                          (uncomfortable)
                   well... i don't recollect.

                              the kid
                       (amazed and dubious)
                   you don't recollect!

     the kid doesn't know whether he's been rebuffed or what, but
     seeing after a moment that his conversation with munny is
     not getting anywhere he decides to have a try at ned.

                              the kid
                   say, ned... ?

                                ned
                               (curt)
                   yeah.

                              the kid
                   how many men you killed?
                        (after a long pause)
                   ain't you gonna answer?

                                ned
                   i don't like the question.

                              the kid
                            (indignant)
                   well, i gotta know what kind of
                   fellas i'm ridin' with, don't i?
                   in case of a scrape.

                                ned
                   how many you killed, kid?

                              the kid
                   five.  i killed five of 'em.
                              (pause)
                   that counts a mexican i killed.
                              (pause)
                   he come at me with a knife.

     there is a long pause and then a flash of lightning and a
     roll of thunder and the nervous whinnies of the horses.

                               munny
                   get some sleep, kid.

                              the kid
                   you boys are crotchety as a
                   couple of hens.

     just then the rain starts and it sizzles in the campfire and
     the horses snort and ned covers his head with his blankets.

                                ned
                   aw shit!
