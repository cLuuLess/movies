     ext. sod hut - day

     close on a mojav coffee tin as munny places it on the fence
     behind his sod hut.  munny has the starr in his right hand
     and he turns and walks back toward the house 15 yards away.

     will and penny are watching.   they know something is going
     on, but they don't know how to ask what it is.

     munny faces the coffee tin and solemnly extends his pistol
     arm straight out and carefuly sights along the barrel.

     bam!  a burst of flame and a puff of black smoke from the
     gun.

     the mojav tin hasn't moved.

     slowly, carefully, munny raises the gun again and aims with
     great deliberation.

     bam!  the coffee tin doesn't move.

     munny shakes his head slowly in disgust and aims again.

     bam!  missed again.

     munny gives a quick sheepish glance in the direction of the
     children.  there is a lot of smoke.  he aims again and

     bam!  he misses.

     munny is irritated and he aims and fires hastily and flame
     bursts from the gun and smoke and

     the tin is unmoved.

     will looks at his feet, embarrassed, not wanting to meet his
     father's eyes.

     munny stuffs the pistol in his waistband and disappears into
     the house.

     will and penny look at one another nervously, wondering
     what's happening.

                               penny
                    did paw used to kill folks?

     will doesn't answer and then he looks up because munny steps
     out of the house again, a sawed off remington 10 gauge
     shotgun in his hands.

     munny raises the double barreled weapon to his shoulder and
     aims carefully and...

     barrrrooooom!  the can flies away in pieces and some of the
     fence, too.
