     ext. big whisky inn - day

     deputy andy russell stepping out of the county office as the
     mud wagon clatters to a stop in front of the big whisky inn.

     andy is just twenty, a good looking kid with a badge on his
     vest and a holstered pistol.  he watches the passengers
     climb out of the mud wagon and, as english bob alights, his
     frock coat parts and gives andy just the quickest glimpse of
     a holstered pistol under the coat.

                               andy
                   pardon me, gentlemen, but local
                   ordinance obliges you to surrender
                   your sidearms to proper authority
                   for the duration of your visit.

     ww looks at english bob and english bob turns and looks andy
     up and down very coolly.

                            english bob
                   proper authority eh?
                            (breezily)
                   well, sir... neither my companion
                   nor i carry firearms on our
                   persons.  rather, we trust in
                   the goodwill of our fellow man
                   and the forbearance of reptiles.

     and english bob gives a smart bow, turns with a swirl of
     coat-tails that allows a brief glimpse of not one, but two
     holstered pistols, and marches off.  as ww follows english
     bob, he glances nervously back to see what young andy will
     do but andy just stares nonplussed.  in that quick glimpse,
     andy saw how the weapons were tied down with thongs, meaning
     the owner wanted a quick pull... and this shit is out of his
     league.
