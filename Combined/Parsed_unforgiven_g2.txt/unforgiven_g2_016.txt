     a headstone.  it says:

                    "claudia feathers munny
                    born, march 11, 1849
                    died, august 6, 1878,
                    aged 29 years, in the
                    full enjoyment of that
                    love which constrained
                    her to leave all for
                    christ and heathen souls

                    lo, we have left all and followed thee:
                    what shall we leave therefore.
                                             19:25"

     the headstone is under a couple of shade trees fifty yards
     from the sod hut.  munny is sitting on a rock under the
     trees looking at the headstone and he has on a cheap black
     suit now.  he twists the hat, tormented... and he starts to
     say something out loud but he can't because men don't talk
     to stones.  so finally he gets up, slumped in defeat, and he
     puts a little bouquet of flowers on the grave and he turns
     away unhappily.
