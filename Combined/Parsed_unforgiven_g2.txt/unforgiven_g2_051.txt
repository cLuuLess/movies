     ext. south road - night

     night and rain and the kid is chuckling drunkenly and
     handing the bottle back to ned who looks at it and tilts it
     way back.  they are riding along the south road in the dark.

                              the kid
                           (cheerfully)
                   i left you some... about a drop.

     munny is hunched in his saddle, shivering, his teeth
     chattering.

                                ned
                   you alright, bill?

     munny doesn't look alright.  he looks like shit... looks
     sick.  he doesn't answer and ned looks worried and takes the
     last drops from the bottle and tosses it in the road near
     the ordinance sign which is too dark to read.
