     ext. main street - day

     snow/moonlight/the shadowy buildings and the silence of the
     nebraska winter except for the sound of the snowshoes.

     the snow has obliterated the main street of big whiskey
     giving the impression that the dark, low buildings are
     scattered at random.  the only structure with any sign of
     life is greely's beer garden and billiards which shows a
     glowing window and two horses out front and that is a
     hundred yards away from the struggling silhouettes of the
     two men on snowshoes.  the big one is little bill daggett
     and he is very big, wrapped in a huge bearskin robe.

     the smaller one is clyde ledbetter who isn't small though he
     has only one arm.

                            little bill
                   ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?

                               clyde
                   hell, you know how skinny is.  says
                   he's gonna shoot 'em...
                   ...an i says, "skinny, you can't
                   do that," an' he says, "well, then
                   get little bill down here an' let's
                   settle this" an' i says, "bill's
                   sleepin', skinny," an'...

     they make their way in silence through the snow, getting
     close now, close to greely's and the lights.
