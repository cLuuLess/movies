     int. barbershop - day

     english bob, delighting in the smooth feel of his freshly
     shaved pink cheeks, climbs cheerfully out of the barber
     chair, still chattering at the poor barber.

                            english bob
                   ...can see that there's a dignity
                   in royalty... a majesty... that
                   precludes the likelihood of
                   assassination.

     the barber is applying his little whisk broom to bob's
     waistcoat while ww pulls out his purse to make payment.

                        english bob contd.
                   why, if you were to point a pistol
                   at a king or a queen, sir, i can
                   assure you your hand would shake
                   as though palsied...

                               barber
                         (looking at bob's
                              pistols)
                   i wouldn't point no pistol at
                   nobody, sir.

                            english bob
                       (putting on his frock
                        coat over his guns)
                   a wise policy.  but if you did,
                   i can assure you, the sight of
                   royalty would cause you to
                   dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed
                   and stand... in awe.
                              (pause)
                   whereas, a president... i mean,
                   why not shoot a president?

     the barber doesn't know how to take this guy, and just ogles
     him.

                            english bob
                   now this strawberry alice person,
                   tell me again.

                               barber
                   down the street and across.  greely's
                   beer garden and billiard parlor.
                   just ask for alice and say you want
                   a game of billiards.

                            english bob
                          (about to exit)
                   billiards, eh?  even though i
                   don't really wish to play?

                               barber
                   don't matter.  they burned the
                   table in '78 for firewood.

                            english bob
                   ah, i see.

     ww has already stepped out and english bob follows him out
     the door.
