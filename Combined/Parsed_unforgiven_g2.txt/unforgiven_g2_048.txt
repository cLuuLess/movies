     ext. main street - day

     a blazing hot day and english bob's battered face staring
     out of the mud wagon which is being loaded up by chandler.
     in the distance the train whistle toots eagerly.

                            little bill
                           (to chandler)
                   give them keys to the conductor
                   and tell him he can loose the
                   cuffs off of bob soon as he's out
                   of the county.

     little bill is standing beside the mud wagon and ww is
     standing next to him and a little knot of onlookers forms a
     semi circle.

                            english bob
                      (talking through closed
                               teeth)
                   mmmm pistols.

                            little bill
                   oh yeah.

     little bill unwraps a cloth and produces the ivory-handled
     peacemakers... smashed and hopelessly bent.  and he gives
     them to bob and looks him in his one furious eye.

                            little bill
                   i guess you know, bob, how if i
                   see you again i'll just start
                   shootin' right off an' figure
                   it's self-defense.

     that's fine with english bob.  he glares back and the two
     men understand each other perfectly and then chandler whips
     the horses and the wagon starts to roll.

                            little bill
                   i ain't stealin' your biographer,
                   bob.  stayin' on was his idea.

     and ww stands there beside little bill and gives bob a shit-
     eating look and english bob just glares and rolls away.
