     int. bar room - night

     close on the whiskey bottle and ned is pouring the bright
     liquid into his glass and munny is mesmerized by the
     dazzling highlights.  the two of them are sitting at a table
     in greely's smokey, dimly lit bar room and the rain is
     beating on the roof and there is a checker game at a table
     fifteen feet away attended by germany joe schultz, tom
     luckinbill, a farmer, eggs anderson, the local restauranteur
     and paddy mcgee the cooper.  all of them are sneaking
     occasional, furtive glances at the strangers, as is fatty
     who is talking to skinny at the bar.

                                ned
                   ...in hell's takin' the kid so
                   long?  you suppose he...
                           (seeing munny)
                   jesus, bill you look like shit.

     munny looks dazed and shakes his head to clear it.

                               munny
                   you... you remember eagle
                   hendershot?

                                ned
                             (startled)
                   huh?  uh... yeah.

                               munny
                   i seen him.

                                ned
                   he's dead, bill.

                               munny
                   his head was all busted open
                   so's you could see the inside.

                                ned
                   jesus, bill, you got fever.
                   take a drink, will you?

                               munny
                          (ignoring ned)
                   worms was comin' out.

                                ned
                           (getting up)
                   listen, bill, i'm gonna see what's
                   takin' the kid so long.  must be
                   he's gettin' an advance offa them
                   sportin' ladies.

     ned starts for the back room, then stops and goes back.

                                ned
                   say, bill... if i was to... take
                   a little while myself... i guess
                   you... i guess you...  i guess
                   you don't want to come?

     munny shakes his head "no" and, as ned departs for the
     billiard room, munny stares vacantly at the whiskey bottle.

                     little bill's voice o.s.
                   ... me your pistol, mister.

                               munny
                      (looking up, startled)
                   huh?

     the big man in the dripping slicker is standing only ten
     feet away... little bill.  and little bill is looking at
     him.  munny can feel everybody in the room staring at him.

                            little bill
                   i says, "you'll want to give
                   over your pistol."

     munny can see charley moving slowly along the wall on the
     left for position... and fatty is over on the right, skinny
     beside him... and ww is by the door shifting nervously and
     the checker players are frozen in their seats and munny can
     feel them all... watching him.

                               munny
                   uh, no.  no, i ain't drunk.

                            little bill
                         (almost friendly)
                   ordinance says you got to turn in
                   your firearms to the county
                   office day or night. i guess you
                   didn't read it with the weather
                   an' all.

                               munny
                            (nervously)
                   well... uh... i... i ain't got
                   no, uh, firearms.

                            little bill
                      (not friendly any more)
                   them friends of yours in the
                   back, they carryin' pistols?

                               munny
                   i... dunno.  i mean, i guess not.
                   no, they ain't carryin' no guns.

                            little bill
                   you're spillin' your whiskey,
                   mister.

                               munny
                   like i said, i...

                            little bill
                   what's your name?

                               munny
                   uh, william... uh... hendershot.

     little sue looks timidly in from the billiard room, bites
     her lip, and retreats quickly.

                            little bill
                   well, mister hendershot, if i was
                   to call you a no good sonofabitch
                   an' a liar, an' if i was to say
                   you shit in your pants on account
                   of a cowardly soul... well, i
                   guess then, you would show me your
                   pistol right quick an' shoot me
                   dead, ain't that so?

                               munny
                             (trapped)
                   i... i guess i might... but like
                   i said, i ain't armed.

     little bill pulls out his pistol and points it at munny and
     makes a little motion with the barrel that means "get up"
     and munny gets up.

     little bill steps close to him and reaches out with his left
     hand and opens munny's coat revealing the starr tucked in
     his belt.

                            little bill
                   i guess you just carry it for
                   snakes an' such.

                               munny
                   uh... yeah.  yeah.

                            little bill
                              (cold)
                   there ain't no snakes in here,
                   mister hendershot.

                               munny
                   well, uh... it ain't loaded.

     little bill takes the pistol out of munny's belt and slowly
     and deliberately ejects five cartridges and he looks at
     munny who is sweating and munny just wants a way out.

                               munny
                   well, the powder's wet an...

     whack!  little bill brings the muzzle of the gun across
     munny's temple and blood flows and munny goes to one knee
     and little bill kicks him hard, whump!

                            little bill
                          (turning to ww)
                   mister beauchamp, this here is
                   the sort of trash i was speakin'
                   of.

     munny is struggling to his feet and staggering weak-kneed to
     the table where he grabs the whiskey bottle and breaks it
     off and turns groggily to face little bill.

     little bill, unperturbed, advances on him and when munny
     strikes desperately with the bottle, little bill blocks his
     blow easily and slams him hard with the muzzle of the pistol
     and munny goes down again.

                            little bill
                              (to ww)
                   you will find these kind in the
                   saloons of your prosperous
                   communities.
                      (whump, he kicks munny)
                   but you will not find none of
                   them in big whiskey.

     munny is on the floor on all fours, trying gamely to get up.
