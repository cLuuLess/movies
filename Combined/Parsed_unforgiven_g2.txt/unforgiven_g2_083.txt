     ext. little bill's house - day

     view on the roof, late afternoon, and little bill is
     crawling around up there with a bucket of tar which he has
     got on his moustache and his face and he looks up because he
     hears the clatter of hooves.


     view on charley heckler

     galloping his horse up to little bill's house and charley is
     very excited and he swings off the horse in front of the
     porch and the porch is at once closer to completion and
     closer to collapse than last we saw it.

                              charley
                         (looking around,
                            breathless)
                   little bill, little bill...

                     little bill's voice o.s.
                   yeah.

     charley looks up, startled and little bill is looking down at
     him over the eaves.

                            little bill
                             (sheepish)
                   makin' some repairs.

                              charley
                           (breathless)
                   the killed one of them cowboys.
