     int. logan house - day

     close on clean ceramic coffee mugs as ned takes them from a
     tidy cabinet in his cozy kitchen with the cast iron stove,
     the solid table.

     munny is sitting at the table looking moodily into space.

                                ned
                            (earnestly)
                    we ain't bad men no more, bill.
                    hell, we're farmers.

                               munny
                          (thoughtfully)
                    should be easy killin' em...
                    supposin' they don't run off to
                    texas first.

                                ned
                       (taking the pot from
                            the stove)
                    how long since you shot a gun at a
                    man?      (pause)
                    nine... ten years?

                               munny
                    eleven.

                                ned
                    easy, huh?  hell, i don't know that
                    it was all that easy then... an'
                    we was young an' full of beans.
                          (pouring coffee)
                    bill... if you was mad at 'em...
                    if they done you wrong... i could
                    see shootin' 'em...

                               munny
                      (looking ned in the eye)
                    we done stuff before for money,
                    ned.

                                ned
                          (sitting down)
                    well, we thought we was doin' it
                    for money...
                     (he pauses, remembering)
                    what'd they do anyhow?  cheat at
                    cards, steal some strays, spit
                    on a rich fella?

                               munny
                    cut up a woman.  cut her eyes out,
                    cut her tits off, cut her fingers
                    off... done everythin' but cut
                    up her cunny, i guess.

                                ned
                      (after chewing on that
                                one)
                    well, i guess they got it comin'...
                     (and he pauses and looks
                         munny in the eye)
                    but you wouldn't go if claudia was
                    alive.

     it hits munny like salt in a wound and he just takes it.
     they both know ned is right and they think about it
     silently.  finally munny speaks glumly.

                               munny
                          (getting up and
                         going to the door)
                    i guess you wouldn't mind to look
                    in on my youngsters next week.
                    might be you could help them move
                    a couple of them pigs if they got
                    to separate 'em more.

     ned has been thinking about it while munny's talking,
     wrestling with it and now munny is out the door.

                                ned
                    how long you gonna be, bill?

                               munny
                    two weeks, i guess.

                                ned
                    this kid, what's he like?

     munny turns and looks at ned and their eyes meet and munny
     realizes ned is coming.

                                ned
                    three ways?

                               munny
                    yup.  you still got the spencer
                    rifle?

                                ned
                           (grinning)
                    yeah, an' i could still hit a bird
                    in the eye flyin'.
