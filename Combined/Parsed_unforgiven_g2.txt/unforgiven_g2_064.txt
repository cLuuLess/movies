     int. shed - night

     night in the shed, a little moonlight coming in through the
     open wall.  the lantern is out and the sound is the sound of
     munny's labored breathing and ned and the kid are in their
     blankets.

                              the kid
                   he's gonna die, ain't he?

                                ned
                   maybe.

                              the kid
                   well, suppose he does?

                                ned
                          (after a pause)
                   we'll bury him.

                              the kid
                   that ain't what i mean.

                                ned
                   you mean, am i gonna help you
                   kill them cowboys?

                              the kid
                   i can't spot 'em myself but you
                   could.  that red-haired one, you
                   could spot a half-mile off, i bet.

                                ned
                   an' if i spot 'em?

                              the kid
                   i'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!

                                ned
                   just like that?

                              the kid
                   i told you i'm a damn killer.
                   i done it before.
                       (pause, you can hear
                         munny breathing)
                   i'm more killer than him.

                                ned
                   yeah?

                              the kid
                   hell, yeah.
