     int. shed - day

     daylight and the cut-whore's face.  delilah is leaning over
     munny wiping his brow.  he is lying in the straw looking up
     at her and he looks like shit... his face ghastly pale and
     stubbled and covered with horrible cuts and bad stitching...
     but his eyes are clear.

                               munny
                   i thought... you was an angel.

                              delilah
                     (embarrassed, getting up)
                   you ain't dead.

     delilah goes over to her horse and gets some packages out of
     the saddle bags.  munny tries to sit up weakly.

                               munny
                   some big guy beat the shit out
                   of me.
                      (feeling his sore face)
                   i guess i must look a lot like
                   you, huh?

                              delilah
                           (angry, hurt)
                   you don't look nothin' like me,
                   mister.

                               munny
                   i didn't mean no offense.
                        (she doesn't answer)
                   i guess you're the one them
                   cowboys cut up.
                            (no answer)
                   ned an' the kid, my partners,
                   are they... ?

                              delilah
                              (coldly)
                   they went out scouting when they
                   saw your fever broke.

                               munny
                   scouting?

                              delilah
                   on the bar t... looking for... them.

                               munny
                   oh.  how long i been here?

                              delilah
                            (still cold)
                   three days.  are you hungry?

                               munny
                   three days?  i must be.
