     ext. shed - day

     a vision, daylight and the horse horribly bloody, screaming
     silently in agony while the sound is the sound of night and
     the shed and the rain dripping but that doesn't diminish the
     agony of the bloody animal as the whip falls on the head and
     the eyes and we see the young man cruelly wielding the whip.

     it is munny fifteen years earlier and it is a picture of
     unbelievable cruelty and viciousness... because that is what
     he was like and what he remembers.
