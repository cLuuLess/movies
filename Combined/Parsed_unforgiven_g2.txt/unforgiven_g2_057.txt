     int. bar room - night

     munny crawling along the floor of the bar room, covered with
     blood, heading for the door.

                            little bill
                   let the man out, ww.  he is
                   desiring to leave the hospitality
                   of big whiskey behind him.

     munny is crawling past ww's legs and ww looks down at the
     miserable semi-conscious creature and he sees clearly the
     left hand and the three fingers as they fight for traction
     and then ww steps to the door and opens it and munny crawls
     into the rain and the night.
