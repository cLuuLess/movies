     ext. main street - night

     night, close view on torchlight flickering on davey's waxy
     face and dead eyes as eggs, germany joe and paddy haul the
     blood-caked body from the back of a buckboard.  ww is
     looking on queasily, taking notes, and behind him the street
     is alive.

                        wiggens' voice o.s.
                   ...an' parsons said how he seen
                   three men right after sun-up
                   headed out east an' one was ridin'
                   a old blue morgan an' another was
                   on a white mare, only he didn't...

     and only a few yards away from the buckboard, in front of
     the county office, little bill is being besieged by deputies
     and townsmen.

                               fatty
                   amos over at the stable says to
                   ask you if the county's payin'

                              charley
                   ...witherspoon says he ain't
                   gonna sell us no more thirty-
                   thirty shells without we pay...

     and the dogs, snarling, fangs bared, pulling at the leash
     and tom luckinbill is trying to keep control.

                                tom
                   ...use the dogs then the county's
                   gotta take responsibility for...

                            little bill
                              (calmly)
                   never mind about them horses,
                   fatty.  just you ride out to the
                   bar t an' make sure that other
                   cowboy stays put an' don't expose
                   himself, hear?
