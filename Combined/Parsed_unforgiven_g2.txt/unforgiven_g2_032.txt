     int. county office - day

     ker-chick, clack, a henry rifle cocked and the action
     checked.  andy is cleaning the weapon in the county office.

                               andy
                   unarmed, my ass.

     shuck, ka-chak.  charley hecker breaks open a single
     barreled shotgun and moves a shell in.

                              charley
                         (wiping his brow
                             nervously)
                   christ, it's hot.

                               fatty
                           ((cheerfully)
                   if i'm gonna get shot, i druther
                   it was hot then cold.  everythin'
                   hurts more in the cold.

     fatty is sitting in a chair in front of the empty jail cell
     cleaning a revolver, oblivious to the tension.

                          fatty (cont'd)
                   you know how if you hit your thumb
                   in the cold, how it...?

                              charley
                   shut up, fatty.

                               fatty
                   i only said...

     outside a horse clatters up fast and andy jumps nervously to
     the window.

                                andy
                   clyde's back.

                              charley
                   little bill with him?

                                andy
                   no.

                              charley
                             (worried)
                   shit.

     clyde bursts in the door.  he is wearing two gun-belts
     crossed, with a holster on each side.  since he has only one
     arm, he carries one pistol butt forward and the other butt
     back.

                               clyde
                   you boys clean my remington?

                               fatty
                          (holding it up)
                   cleaned an' loaded.

                              charley
                   where's little bill for christ
                   sake?

                               clyde
                      (inspecting the pistol)
                   ha.  he was building his fucking
                   porch.

                              charley
                   building his porch!

                               fatty
                   if you was to get shot, andy,
                   would you like it better to be
                   a hot day or...?

                               andy
                             (sharply)
                   i ain't gonna get shot.

                              charley
                             (to clyde)
                   he's coming ain't he?

                               clyde
                         (ejecting shells)
                   'course he's coming.

                               fatty
                   hey, i just loaded her.  watcha
                   doin?

                               clyde
                   i don't trust nobody to load my
                   guns, not for a shootin'.

                              charley
                   what'd he say?

                               clyde
                   little bill?  he didn't say nothing.
                   like i said, he was buildin' his
                   porch.  have you seen that thing?

                               fatty
                             (sulking)
                   it was all loaded.  jesus, clyde,
                   you got three pistols an' only
                   one arm for christ sake.

                               clyde
                            (to fatty)
                   i just don't wanna get killed for
                   lack of shootin' back.
                           (to charley)
                   you know there ain't a straight
                   angle in that whole goddamn
                   porch... or in the whole house
                   for that matter.  he's the worst
                   fucking carpenter.

                              charley
                             (worried)
                   he didn't say nothin', huh?

                               clyde
                      (putting the 3rd pistol
                            in his belt)
                   asked what they looked like,
                   that's all.  christ, maybe he's
                   tough but he sure ain't no
                   carpenter.

                              charley
                   maybe he ain't so tough.

     clyde looks up, surprised.  there is a sudden silence.

                               andy
                           (blurting it)
                   he seem like... like he was...
                   scared?

                               clyde
                             (amazed)
                   little bill?  him scared?

                              charley
                   we never seen him up against
                   any... like these ones... killers.

                               clyde
                     (looking at the frightened
                     faces of charley and andy)
                   little bill come out of kansas
                   an' texas, boys.  he worked
                   them tough towns.

                              charley
                             (ashamed)
                   just wondered.  anybody could
                   be scared.

     andy drops his eyes and looks away from clyde.

                               clyde
                          (with meaning)
                   no.  he wasn't scared, boys.
                   he just ain't a good carpenter.
