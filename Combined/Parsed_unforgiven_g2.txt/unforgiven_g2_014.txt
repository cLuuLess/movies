     int. sod hut - day

     close on a photograph of claudia in munny's hands.  he is
     inside, kneeling on the floor beside an open truck and he is
     studying reverently the old photo of claudia, smiling
     radiantly in her best dress.  finally munny puts the picture
     down and digs in the trunk among folded dresses that
     belonged to her until he feels something metal and he sees
     the blue steel among the white cloth and then he pulls it
     out... an old starr .44 pistol.
