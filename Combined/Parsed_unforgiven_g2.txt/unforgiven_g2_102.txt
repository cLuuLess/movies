     ext. alleyway - night

     ww beauchamp and charley hecker and germany joe crouched in
     the alleyway between two buildings across the street and
     charley has a rifle and they can see munny mounting his
     horse.

                            germany joe
                            (whispering)
                   go ahead, shoot him.

     charley just shakes his head and offers the rifle to germany
     joe.  and germany joe doesn't want it.

                            germany joe
                   i endt no dehpoody.

     ww is watching munny's unbelievably awkward and prolonged
     mounting procedure and he can't believe it, he can't believe
     what the old west is like and it shows on his face.
