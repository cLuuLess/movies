     ext. train - day

     turkeys bursting from long nebrasks grass as the train
     whistle screams.

     blam!  a turkey plummets to earth.

     blam!  another goes down.

     view on english bob

     on the swaying platform between cars, his pistol smoking and
     bob brings it up again fast and sights and blam!

     an explosion of feathers plummeting down and disappearing in
     the long grass.

     view on the other side of the platform

     where ww beauchamp, crocker, thurston, fuzzy and the nervous
     drummer, in a cheap bowler, are standing.   they are all
     impressed with the fact that english bob is one hell of a
     shot with a pistol.

                            english bob
                            (to crocker)
                   i believe that's eight for me...
                   to one for you.  a matter of
                   seven of your american dollars.

                              crocker
                       (grudgingly counting
                          silver dollars)
                   pretty damn good shootin'....
                             (daring)
                   for a john bull.

                            english bob
                       (accepting the money
                            cheerfully)
                   no doubt your aim was affected by
                   your grief over the injury to your
                   ... uh... president.
