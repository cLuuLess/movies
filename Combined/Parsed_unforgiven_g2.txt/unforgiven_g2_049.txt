     ext. main street - moments later

     as the mud wagon rattles down the dusty street english bob
     sticks his horrid swollen face out the window and screams
     insanely:

                            english bob
                   a plague on you!  a plague on the
                   whole stinking lot of you!  you're
                   uncivilized vermin, without laws
                   or morals!  you're worthless
                   savages!  i curse you!  you're
                   cursed!  cursed!

     the whores, fanning themselves on greeley's porch, stare
     dumbfounded as the madman rolls by raving.  then he's gone.
     all that remains is the sound of his ranting, diminishing in
     the distance and a cloud of dust settling on the hot street.

     sitting next to faith on the porch, alice fans herself
     grimly.

                               alice
                   nobody's gonna come.

                               faith
                   huh?

                               alice
                   after what little bill done to
                   the englishman.

     skinny steps out the door and blinks in the dazzling light
     and wipes his face.

                               skinny
                   delilah, them tables ain't clean.
                   can't you get 'em clean?

     delilah gets up and goes in, angrily brushing past skinny in
     the doorway.

                               skinny
                            (after her)
                   well, if you'd cover up your face,
                   maybe somebody'd want to fuck with
                   you an' you wouldn't have to do
                   all the cleanin'.
                          (to the others)
                   whaddaya call them things that
                   cover the face?

                               faith
                      (looking straight ahead)
                   a veil.

                               skinny
                   yeah, a veil.  christ it's hot.

     there is a distant roll of thunder and skinny looks off at
     the southern horizon where storm clouds are gathering.

                               alice
                            (listlessly)
                   rain's coming.

                               skinny
                           (emphatically)
                   thank god.
