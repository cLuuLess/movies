     ext. big whiskey hill - day

     extreme close up on delilah

     delilah's face!  the cut-whore.  skeins of criss-crossing
     raised flesh, a vicious web of scars dominated by her eyes
     that are deep and beautiful.

     she's hanging clothes on a clothes line on big whiskey hill,
     the gentle slope above the town.  alice, little sue, silky,
     kate, and faith are close by, hanging clothes or washing
     them in the gurgling stream.

     faith is the first to glance down the hill toward the town
     and to notice.  she draws in her breath and turns to alice
     and catches her eye and alice looks down.
