     ext. sod hut - day

     daylight and penny sweeping in the doorway of munny's sod
     hut in kansas.  she is intent on her work until she hears
     the snort of a horse and looks up and her jaw drops, and her
     face lights up like the sun itself and, dropping the broom,
     she dashes toward him.

     view on munny

     munny walking across the field, leading the mare.  he is
     covered with dust and heavily stubbled from the trip.  penny
     dashes up to him and throws her arms around him and he is
     overjoyed but he doesn't have any way to express it except
     through awkwardness and embarrassment.

                               munny
                              (fondly)
                   ain't you a lady!

     and he puts his arm around her and they walk toward the
     house.
