     ext. boulders - day

     view on ned, his face covered with sweat, the spencer
     against his cheek and he is crouched among some boulders up
     the canyon wall about three hundred yards from davey and
     munny is looking over ned's shoulder and the kid is trying
     to see, too, squinting desperately, but he can't see shit.

                               munny
                   finish him, ned.

                              the kid
                   he ain't dead?  you didn't get him?

                               munny
                   (to the kid, without turning)
                   he got the boy's horse.

     looking down the barrel of the rifle ned can see davey
     struggling frantically to get free of the horse and it is an
     easy shot and ned is sweating, his hand is shaking and he
     can hear munny's voice.

                        munny's voice o.s.
                   better get him 'fore he gets
                   clear of the horse, ned.

     and ned is shaking and crack, he fires.
