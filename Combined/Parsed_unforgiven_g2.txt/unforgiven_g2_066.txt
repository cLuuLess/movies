     ext. woods near shed - day

     close on robins, four of them in the woods near the shed and
     munny is watching them where he sits wolfing chicken
     hungrily, his back against the shed.  delilah is watching
     him eat.

                               munny
                   i thought i was gone.  see them
                   birds?  most times i wouldn't
                   even notice them birds much.  but
                   i'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause
                   i thought i was dead.

                              delilah
                   i brought your hat.  you... left
                   it down at greely's.

                               munny
                   that big guy lookin' for me?

     as he looks over at her munny's eye falls briefly on her
     exposed ankle and delilah feels the look.

                              delilah
                   little bill?  he thinks you
                   went north.

     munny can't help it and his eye flicks back to the ankle.

                              delilah
                   are you really going to kill
                   them?

                               munny
                        (unenthusiastically)
                   yeah, i guess.
                             (suddenly)
                   there's still a payment, ain't
                   there?

     she nods and she moves so that more ankle is showing, but
     munny's eye is drawn to her breasts as she moves, then he
     looks away quickly, guiltily and they sit there silently
     until...

                              delilah
                   them other two, they been takin'
                   advances on the payment.

                               munny
                   advances?

     he can't help looking at her body and she knows it.

                              delilah
                              (shyly)
                   free ones.

     her body is getting to him.

                               munny
                             (stupidly)
                   free ones?

                              delilah
                   alice an' silky gave them...
                   free ones.

                               munny
                          (understanding,
                            embarrassed)
                   oh.  yeah.

                              delilah
                            (shy, timid)
                   you want... a free one.

                               munny
                           (looking away,
                            embarrassed)
                   me?  no.  no, i guess not.

     and delilah is hurt... crushed.  she gets up and covers it
     by picking up the remains of the chicken and munny is too
     embarrassed to look at her.

                              delilah
                        (covering her hurt)
                   i didn't mean... with me.  alice
                   and silky, they'll give you
                   one... if you want.

                               munny
                   i... i guess not.
                       (unusually perceptive
                             suddenly)
                   i didn't mean i didn't want one
                   'cause of you bein' cut up.  i
                   didn't mean that.

     delilah keeps her back to him.

                               munny
                         (trying to get up)
                   it ain't that at all.  you're a
                   beautiful woman.  what i said
                   before, how i might look like you
                   ... i didn't mean you was ugly
                   like me, hell no... i only meant
                   how we both had scars.

     he is standing weakly, supporting himself on the wall and
     his speech is so sincere and delilah wants to believe it.

                               munny
                   you're a beautiful woman an'...
                   if i was to want a free one, i
                   guess i'd want you more than them
                   others.  it ain't... see... i
                   can't have no free one on account
                   of my wife...

                              delilah
                   your wife?

                               munny
                   yeah.  see?

                              delilah
                          (after a pause)
                   i admire that, you being true to
                   your wife.  i've seen a lot of...
                   of men... who weren't.

                               munny
                     (pleased and embarrassed)
                   yeah, i guess.

                              delilah
                   she back in kansas?

                               munny
                   uh... yeah.  yeah.  she's uh...
                   watchin' over the little ones.

     and munny gives her what for him is his best social smile...
     sort of like a pig strangling.
