     view on davey and he is crawling clear of the horse but his
     leg is broken and it's hard and he looks toward the rocks
     where his friends are hiding sixty yards away.

                         texas slim's voice
                         (from behind rock)
                   behind you, davey.  go for them
                   rocks behind you.

     and turning, davey can see a couple of boulders only fifteen
     yards away that will provide cover.
