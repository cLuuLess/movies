     ext. hog pen - day

     the hog in the mud, snorting and squealing, ugly as hell and
     bill munny in the mud with him, pushing and shoving, trying
     to move the stubborn animal and munny goes down face first
     and comes up more covered with mud than he already was and
     the words on the screen say,

                       written words (super)
                   some months later, hodgeman
                   county, kansas.

     munny is thirty-five or forty years old, his hair is
     thinning and his moustache droops glumly over his stubbled
     jaw.  if it were not for his eyes he would look like any pig
     farmer with his canvas overalls tucked in his boots pushing
     on a hog.  he is pushing on the hog again, grunting with the
     effort, when he hears the voice.

                        the kid's voice o.s.
                  you don't look like no rootin',
                  tootin', sonofabitchin',
                  cold-blooded assassin.

                               munny
                      (looking up, startled)
                  huh?

     the kid is only six feet away, the sun behind him, sitting
     on a very big and very ancient morgan horse.  he's wearing
     a wide-brimmed texas hat, a vest, a holstered pistol, and he
     is a wiry kid, maybe twenty years old, with scraggly blonde
     hair, four of his upper front teeth missing, and a funny,
     squinty way of looking out of his watery blue eyes.  most of
     all, he doesn't look very prosperous.

                              the kid
                   i seen how you got only three
                   fingers on your left hand, though,
                   so i guess you're calling yourself
                   mister bill munny.

     munny does indeed have three fingers on his left hand and he
     doesn't like this conversation at all.

                               munny
                   william munny, yeah.

     
                              the kid
                   same one as shot charlie pepper in
                   lake county?

                              a voice
                   paw!  hey, paw!

     the voice belongs to will,  a skinny ten-year-old who dashes
     up with his seven-year-old sister, penny, right on his
     heels.  the kids are ragged and dirty, they don't look well
     fed or even very healthy.  even as will speaks to his
     father, munny, his eyes, and penny's too, go to the kid.
     they don't see many strangers.

                               munny
                   what is it, son?

                               will
                   two more hogs got the fever.

     munny winces.  the kid ignores the interruption.

                              the kid
                   you shot charlie pepper, didn't
                   you?  and you're the one killed
                   william harbey an' robbed the
                   train over...

                               munny
                             (sharply)
                   hold on, mister.
                             (to will)
                   son, this here pig gotta be moved
                   outta this pen, away from them
                   others.  penny, you give yer
                   brother a hand...

                               penny
                            (emotional)
                   this one's sick too?

     munny ignores the question, already on his way to the
     miserable-looking shack.

                               munny
                   let's talk inside, mister.
