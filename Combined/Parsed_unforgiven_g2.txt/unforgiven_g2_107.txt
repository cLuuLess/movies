     ext. grave - day

     the grave of claudia under the trees and munny walks up to
     it and maybe we hear music or maybe just the wind, but the
     words begin to crawl across the screen, supered.

                       written words (crawl)
                   they were married in st. louis in
                   1b70 and they traveled north to
                   kansas where he engaged in farming
                   and swine husbandry.  she bore him
                   two children in the eight years of
                   their marriage and when she died,
                   it was not at his hands as her
                   mother might have expected, but of
                   smallpox.

     view on munny

     we are looking at him by now and there is nothing easy on
     his face, no big emotions, he is just looking at the grave.

                    written words (crawl cont'd)
                   some years later, mrs. ansonia
                   feathers made the arduous journey
                   to hodgeman county to visit the
                   last resting place of her only
                   daughter.

     view on the grave

     we are looking at the stone now and the words continue.

                    written words (crawl cont'd)
                   william munny had long since sold
                   the place and disappeared with the
                   children... some said to san
                   francisco where it was rumored he
                   prospered as a dry goods merchant
                   under a different name.

     close on the eyes of william munny

     the eyes of the husband and the pig-farmer and the man who
     shot down five men in the big whiskey saloon.

                    written words (crawl cont'd)
                   and there was nothing on the stone
                   to explain to mrs. feathers why
                   her only daughter had married a
                   known thief and murderer, a man of
                   notoriously vicious and
                   intemperate disposition.
