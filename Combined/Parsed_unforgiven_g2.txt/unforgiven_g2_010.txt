     ext. hog pen - day

     munny in the mud and the pig squealing and will is there
     pushing too and munny goes in face first again and when he
     comes up he slowly wipes mud from his face and, turning, he
     looks across the fields.

     view on penny

     coming up beside the pen.

                               penny
                   paw... two of them others
                   ...i think they got the fever.

     munny frowns and looks off at the horizon, lost in thought.

     view on the kid

     way off in the distance, disappearing on the horizon.
