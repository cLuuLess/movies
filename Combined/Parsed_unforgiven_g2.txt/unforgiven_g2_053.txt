     int. little bill's house - day

     drip drip drip.  a chamber pot on the floor of little bill's
     house collecting water from a leak in the roof and little
     bill is walking about in stocking feet, making a speech.

                            little bill
                   "no," he says, "you are wrong
                   little bill.  that there is no
                   curly j but a bobbed j."  he
                   had worked it over, you see?

     ww beauchamp is sitting in a chair scratching frantic notes
     with a quill pen... and a splotch of water hits the paper
     and he glances up because there is a new leak.

                            little bill
                      (continuing, oblivious)
                   "jim," i says, "you are a liar and
                   a horsethief."  now -- when he
                   seen them others wasn't gonna help
                   him none -- he started in to
                   cryin' and sobbin' and sayin'...
                            (mimicking)
                   "don't kill me, little bill,
                   don't kill me, please don't
                   kill me."

     ww is trying to write and trying to slide away from the leak
     without interrupting little bill who is delighting in his
     own narration, oblivious to the new leak.

                            little bill
                        (in his own voice)
                   "well, jim," i says, "it makes me
                   sick to see a man struttin' around
                   and packin' two pistols an' a henry
                   rifle and cryin' like a baby."

                                ww
                   did you... kill him?

                            little bill
                   no,... but i can't abide them
                   kind... an' you will find a lot of
                   them in the saloons... tramps an'
                   drunk teamsters an' crazy
                   miners... sportin' pistols like
                   they was bad men, but not having
                   no sand nor character... not even
                   bad character.

     ww is really getting wet and he is moving the chair.

                            little bill
                         (on his own wave
                              length)
                   i do not like assassins an' men
                   of low character like your friend
                   english bob... but bob ain't no
                   coward who will cry to your face
                   an' then...

                                ww
                   uh... sheriff... uh...

                            little bill
                   huh?  oh.
                        (looking up sadly)
                   another one, huh?  shit, i guess
                   i'm clean out of receptacles.

                                ww
                        (trying a joke with
                              effort)
                   maybe you should... hang the
                   carpenter.

                            little bill
                          (jaw dropping)
                   what?

                                ww
                             (uneasy)
                   uh... hang the... uh...
                   carpenter.  i...

     there is a sudden loud knocking on the door and bill turns
     and goes to the door.

                            little bill
                   on a night like this?  what
                   the hell?

     opening the door he reveals charlie hecker, wearing a
     slicker and shedding water like a waterfall.

                              charley
                   three seedy lookin' fellas come
                   inta town, bill.  they're down
