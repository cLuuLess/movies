     ext. open country - day

     the three of them riding across open country.  the kid looks
     like he still has a thorn up his ass and the only sound is
     the creaking of saddles.

     storm clouds are gathering behind them on the horizon.

                               munny
                   oh shit.

     and the kid looks back but of course he can't figure out
     what it is they saw.

                              the kid
                   what the hell are you pissin'
                   about, i'd like to know?

                               munny
                           (astonished)
                   huh?

                              the kid
                   well, what were you lookin' at
                   anyhow?

                               munny

                   them clouds on account of we got

                              the kid
                          (looking back)
                   oh, them.
