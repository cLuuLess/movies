     ext. north road - night

     moonlight on the ordinance #14 sign on the north road and
     two riders come up slow, munny and the kid, and munny reins
     up and then the kid does too.  munny takes the saddle bags
     off his horse.

                               munny
                     (giving the kid the bags)
                   this here money, take my share an'
                   ned's an' leave it with my
                   youngsters.  tell 'em half goes to
                   sally two trees if i ain't back in
                   a week.  the rest is yours... you
                   could buy them spectacles.

                              the kid
                   are you... are you gonna...
                   kill little bill?

                               munny
                          (holding up the
                          whiskey bottle)
                   i guess you won't mind my keepin'
                   the bottle.

                              the kid
                   you're gonna kill him, ain't you?

                               munny
                   stay clear of folks you might see.
                   there's plenty out lookin' to
                   hang you.  go on now, skedaddle.

     munny slaps the kid's horse and the kid sets out at a trot
     and munny watches him disappear into the night.  when he is
     alone and he can't hear the kid's horse any more, munny
     uncorks the bottle and takes a long deep drink.
