     int. shed - day

     daylight in the shed and munny's face, waxy yellow, crude
     stitching, hideous swelling eyes vacant, breathing heavy.

     he is lying in the straw and the kid is looking down at him
     with distaste.  the kid is only partly dressed.

                              the kid
                   he don't look so good.

     the sound of the rain is different: it's still coming but it
     isn't a storm any more.  the shed is an irregular shelter
     because one wall and various parts of the roof have
     collapsed and the woods outside are clearly visible.

     silky is sitting on some straw straightening her clothes and
     ned and alice are climbing out of a corner where they have
     obviously been at it and are in various states of dress.

                              the kid
                             (to alice)
                   he didn't even pull his pistol, huh?

                                ned
                            (irritated)
                   he ain't as tough as you, kid.

                              the kid
                   well, i guess i woulda at least
                   pulled my pistol an...

                                ned
                   shit, kid, you pulled your
                   pistol... right outta the lady
                   an' out the back window.

                              the kid
                   that was your idea, i wanted to...

                               silky
                      (getting up and smooth-
                            ing herself)
                   we gotta go.

                              the kid
                   huh?  already?  hey, i'm near
                   ready for another advance.

                               silky
                   you're gonna use it all up before
                   you get it.

                               alice
                          (about to leave)
                   no more advances on what you
                   ain't done yet.

                              the kid
                   well, we're just waitin' on the
                   weather.  if the weather breaks
                   tomorrow we could...

                                ned
                             (to alice)
                   we're gonna need more food... at
                   least three days worth...

                              the kid
                   three days?  we could kill 'em
                   tomorrow.

                                ned
                          (a sharp look at
                              the kid)
                   i don't kill nobody without him.
                         (indicating munny)

                              the kid
                            (frustrated)
                   we don't need him.  the two of
                   us could do it.

     the horses are partly under the roof and alice and silky are
     leading theirs out and nobody is paying attention to the
     kid.

                              the kid
                            (petulantly)
                   he ain't nothin' but a broken
                   down pig farmer.

                               alice
                       (mounting her horse,
                              to ned)
                   one of us'll bring food in the
                   morning.  i guess you'll want
                   some whiskey.

                                ned
                   an' medicine if you got it...

     the kid walks over to the edge of the broken wall and from
     the other corner munny moans loudly and then screams.

                               munny
                   ohhhhh, ooohhhh no.  no, i
                   didn't do nothin'.

     ned hurries over to munny and the kid is left there with the
     two whores who are both mounted now and the kid is
     embarrassed.

                              the kid
                   don't it make you sick, hearin'
                   him like that?
                      (the whores turn their
                              horses)
                   don't you ladies worry none...
                   me an' ned, we'll kill those
                   two fuckers.

     and the kid has picked up two pieces of paper that the
     whores gave them earlier and they are charcoal sketches, one
     of davey bunting and the other of quick mike and they are
     pretty fair likenesses.
