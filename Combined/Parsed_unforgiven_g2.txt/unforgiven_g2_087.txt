     ext. outhouse - dawn

     dawn, the outhouse, birds chirping cheerily and the outhouse
     door opens and buck barthol steps out and stretches
     luxuriously.

     view on bushes and the kid holding his nose.  the bushes are
     right behind the outhouse and the stink is terrible.  the
     kid is crouched there and he is doing an elaborate pantomime
     of his suffering for munny's benefit.
