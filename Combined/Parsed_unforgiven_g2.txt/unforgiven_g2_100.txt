     int. bar room - night

     view on little bill in the crowded bar and he is shouting to
     make himself heard over the din.

                            little bill
                   alright, i'm gonna say just one
                   more time so it's all clear an'
                   then don't ask me no more.

     the place is packed with tired, dusty men and they are not
     really jubilant so much as they are excited by the hysteria
     of events.

                            little bill
                            (continuing)
                   now each of you that posse'd
                   today has got one drink comin'
                   off the county budget...

                              thirsty
                   yahoo.

                            little bill
                   ...an' whoever rode yesterday,
                   gets one drink for that...

                               paddy
                   yippee.

                               eggs
                   i told yuh two, i...

                            little bill
                   hold it hold it.  after them two,
                   it's outta your own pocket...
                   hear me, skinny? ...an' we're
                   pullin' out early tomorrow an'
                   chase these fellas clear to texas
                   so i wouldn't spend much of your
                   own money.

     there is a general whoop and hubbub as little bill turns
     back to his conversation at the bar with charley, fatty,
     clyde, andy and ww beauchamp.

                            little bill
                   now if we divide up into four
                   parties an' hit all the farms an'
                   trails in a circle, we're bound
                   to find some one who seen them
                   skunks an'...

     little bill is suddenly conscious of his own loud voice in a
     sudden silence that has swept the bar like a brushfire and
     turning he sees what everybody is staring at.

     munny, with his ten-gauge shotgun leveled from the shoulder,
     is standing thirty feet away in the doorway.  taking a
     couple of sideways steps to get the door from behind his
     back and sweeping the twin barrels in an ominous arc, he
     surveys the scene.

                               munny
                          (a little drunk)
                   which fucker owns this shithole?

     nobosy says a thing.  skinny stares pop-eyed from behind the
     bar and the sweat starts on his forehead and little bill is
     thinking coolly and everybody else is swallowing hard and
     looking at the shotgun.

                               munny
                             (to fatty)
                   you there, fat man, speak up.

     fatty gulps and then skinny screws up his courage and steps
     from behind the bar and gives it every bit of dignity his
     fear will permit.

                               skinny
                   i... i own this establishment.
                   i bought it from greely for a
                   thous...

                               munny
                         (to the men round
                              skinny)
                   better step clear, boys.

     and skinny looks from side to side as people step away from
     him and he wants to say something desperately, he wants to
     live, he wants...

                            little bill
                   hold on, mist...

     bah-whoom!  munny fires and smoke belches and...

     skinny is blown back against the wall and falls to the
     floor a bloody mess and...

     little bill is reaching for the spencer which is leaning
     against the bar near his leg but he freezes because...

     munny has turned the shotgun on him and munny sees ned's
     spencer there and his eyes show how he feels about it.

     for a moment while the smoke clears the bar is silent and
     there are nervous glances cast at the bloody body of skinny
     but little bill keeps his eyes on munny.

                            little bill
                   well sir... you are a cowardly
                   sonofabitch because you have just
                   shot down an unarmed man.

     it has become a very formal moment and there are,
     figuratively speaking, only two people in the room, munny
     and little bill... and ww beauchamp is watching them, scared
     to death, but this is it, what all those easterners dreamed
     about, the showdown in the saloon.

                               munny
                       (the shotgun pointed
                       right at little bill)
                   he should have armed himself if he
                   was gonna decorate his saloon with
                   the body of my friend.

                            little bill
                   i guess you are three-fingered
                   jack out of missouri, killer of
                   women and children.

                               munny
                       (a little drunkenly)
                   i have done that... killed women
                   and children... i have killed most
                   everything that walks or crawls
                   an' now i have come to kill you,
                   little bill, for what you done to
                   ned.
                          (to the others)
                   now step aside. boys.

     and as the deputies nervously move aside little bill helps
     to isolate himself by stepping forward boldly.

                             little bill
                   he's got one barrel left,
                   gentlemen.  after he has used it,
                   pull your pistols and shoot him
                   down like the cowardly, drunken
                   scoundrel he is.

     little bill looks back at munny bravely and...

     munny looks down the barrel at little bill and after a tense
     moment he pulls the trigger.

     click.  the hammer falls but it is a misfire and what
     happens next happens in maybe five seconds as all hell
     breaks loose.

                            little bill
                             (drawing)
                   misfire!  kill the sonofabitch!

     and little bill aims carefully and...

     munny hurls the shotgun at him and...

     blam!... little bill fires wildly as the shotgun hits him
     and...

     clyde has his pistol out and is pointing it at munny and...

     munny is pulling the pistol from his own belt and he drops
     to one knee and...

     blam!... clyde fires and misses and...

     little bill is about to squeeze the trigger when...

     blam!... munny shoots him and...

     blam!... little bill shoots just as he is hit in the chest
     and...

     blam!  blam!... fatty fires wildly and...

     munny is aiming too and blam!...

     clyde gets it in the face and...

     blam!... blam!... fatty isn't even aiming while...

     andy aims carefully, he can kill munny but...

     munny turns and points his weapon at andy and...

     instead of firing andy panics and tries to turn his body
     sideways to ward off the blow and...

     blam!... munny fires and...

     andy gets it high in the rib cage and...

     charley turns and runs for the back and...

     blam!  blam!... fatty is backing up and firing from the hip
     and then he turns to run and...

     munny aims deliberately from one knee and blam!...

     fatty goes down, shot in the back...

     and suddenly... there is a terrible silence that is broken
     only by the awful, dying groans of clyde and the coughing of
     the bystanders hiding behind tables and chairs in the thick
     black smoke and...

     munny is still down on one knee pointing his pistol and
     looking through the thick smoke for someone to shoot but it
     seems there are no threats left.

                                munny
                   every asshole that doesn't want
                   to get shot best clear out the
                   back quick.

     and they scramble over each other dashing toward the
     billiard room and munny stands up and looks around and he
     looks at clyde who is groaning, his face covered with blood
     and everyone else, little bill, andy and fatty are still,
     and then fatty seems to move and munny levels his pistol and
     what happens is ww crawls out from half-under fatty and ww
     is covered with blood and he is shaking like a leaf.

                                ww
                   i... i... think i'm... shot.

                               munny
                   you ain't shot.

                                ww
                        (seeing the pistol)
                   p-p-p-please, i'm not armed.
                       (as munny lowers the
                      pistol, ww looks around)
                   m-m-my g-god.  you killed...
                   little bill.

                               munny
                            (suspicious)
                   you sure you ain't armed?

                                ww
                   i never c-c-carry arms.  i'm...
                   a writer.

                               munny
                   a writer?  what do you write...
                   letters an' such?

                                ww
                   b-b-books.
                             (amazed)
                   you... you killed five men...
                   singlehanded.

                               munny
                             (wearily)
                   yeah.

     munny walks over to the bar, keeping his eye suspiciously on
     ww, and reaches for a bottle with his left hand.  the hand
     is shaking like palsy and he tilts the bottle and drinks
     sloppily with effort, the pistol still in his right hand.

                                ww
                   wh-wh-who did you kill first?

                               munny
                   huh?

                                ww
                             (reciting)
                   wh-wh-when confronted by superior
                   numbers, the experienced
                   gunfighter will fire on the best
                   shots first.

                               munny
                             (drinking)
                   yeah?

     unnoticed on the floor, little bill is conscious though
     blood is coming out of his mouth and he has been written
     off.  one hand is shifting on his pistol and he can hear
     clyde moaning sporadically.

                                ww
                   little bill told me that.  you
                   killed him first, didn't you?

     on the floor, little bill is fighting for consciousness,
     fingering his pistol.

                               munny
                   i was lucky in the order.
                             (bitterly)
                   i always been lucky killin'
                   folks.

                                ww
                   who was next?  clyde?  or was it...?

                               munny
                         (suddely ominous,
                          pistol pointing)
                   i could tell you who was last,
                   mister.

     ww's eyes pop as he gets the idea and he backs up fast, and
     then he turns and bolts out the back, and watching him go,
     munny turns his back on the fallen body of little bill.

     little bill, on the floor, raises up his pistol in his
     shaking hand and aims at munny's back maybe six feet away
     and he is shaking bad as he draws the hammer back and...

     munny hears the click and he turns and sees little bill
     aiming but it is too late and...

     blam!  smoke and fire from little bill's pistol and little
     bill's arm collapses from the effort and the pistol falls
     with a bang.

                               munny
                   missed again, asshole.

     and munny steps over to him and kicks the pistol away from
     little bill's outstretched hand.  little bill is bleeding
     from the mouth having taken a shot in the lung and he is
     very weak and all he can do is look up at munny and speak
     weakly.

                            little bill
                   i don't... deserve this... to
                   die this way.  i was... building
                   a house.

                               munny
                         (aiming his pistol
                            point blank)
                   "deserve" don't mean shit, little
                   bill.

                            little bill
                      (the pistol in his face)
                   i'll see you... in hell, you
                   three-fingered asshole.

     blam!  munny shoots little bill and then he looks around and
     clyde is still groaning and that is the only sound.  then,
     suddenly, he is all business.  he walks quickly over to
     clyde and shoots him once with the spencer and the groaning
     stops.  then he goes to little bill's body and pokes around
     in the pockets and pulls out some shells for the spencer.
     he shoves those in his pocket and he goes to the bar and
     picks up the bottle of whiskey and walks over to the door.
     standing to one side, he kicks it open.  then he sets down
     the rifle and the bottle and starts to reload the schofield
     and while he loads it he shouts out the door.

                               munny
                   i'm comin' outta here... an' any
                   fucker i see out there, i'm gonna
                   kill him... an' any fucker takes a
                   shot at me, i ain't just gonna
                   kill him, but i'm gonna kill his
                   wife an' all his friends an' burn
                   his fucking house, hear?

     the pistol is loaded and munny sticks it in his belt and he
     takes a long pull on the whiskey bottle and wipes the
     dribble from his chin.  then he picks up the rifle in the
     other hand and looks out the door.
