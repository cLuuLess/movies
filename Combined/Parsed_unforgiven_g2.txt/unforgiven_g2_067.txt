     ext. box canyon - day

     view on the bawling calf and the red hot iron coming out of
     the fire.  it is midday in the box canyon and the four
     cowboys, texas slim, johnny foley, lippy macgregor and davey
     bunting are branding strays and johnny has the calf down
     ready for the pigging string but the calf kicks loose and
     knocks johnny into the fire and the other three cowboys are
     guffawing, their sweaty faces full of the camaraderie of
     hardworking men who might get irritable by the end of the
     day but not yet.  and then like a flash, still laughing,
     young davey is on his paint and riding like hell after the
     stray and it is beautiful to watch because he and the paint
     are like one.

     crack!  a rifle shot and the pony does a violent somersault
     and davey goes over in a spray of dirt and fifty yards away
     texas slim, lippy and johnny stare in frozen horror.

     the downed pony spurts blood from his nostrils, and davey's
     right leg is pinned under the dying paint's flank and they
     are maybe fifteen yards from the edge of the canyon and
     davey's first thought is the pony.

                               davey
                   oh, jesus, fella...
                             (shouting)
                   boys, my pony's hurt...

     and turning he sees the three cowboys standing fifty yards
     away, frozen in their tracks.

                               davey
                   boys...

     and they suddenly turn and run away toward some rocks and it
     is only then that the terror hits davey and in a sudden
     panic he tries to get free of the horse.

                               davey
                   oh, jesus, boys, my leg's broke.
                   i'm pinned, boys.
