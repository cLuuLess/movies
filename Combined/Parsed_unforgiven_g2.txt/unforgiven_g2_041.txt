     int. county office - night

     close on a book

     the lurid cover, "the duke of death" by w. w. beauchamp.
     little bill is looking at the cover, his feet propped on his
     desk in the county office.  it is night and the office is
     lit with an oil lamp.

                            little bill
                      (referring to the book)
                   them boys look like real hard
                   cases.  did you kill all seven of
                   'em dead, bob... or did you just
                   wing some of 'em?

     english bob is lying on his back on a cot in the little cell
     a few feet away.  he turns his head toward little bill and
     his swollen face is horrible to behold.  of course, he
     doesn't answer except with the nasty eye.

                            little bill
                   that is you there, ain't it, bob?
                   the duck of death?

                                ww
                             (daring)
                   uh... duke.

     ww is in the little cell next to english bob's.

                            little bill
                   oh yeah... duke.  well, bob, you
                   always was hell an' jesus with a
                   pistol... but seven of 'em, an'
                   you protectin' the lady too...
                   how'd you do it?

     english bob just turns his malignant stare away but ww
     screws up his courage and asserts himself... sort of.

                                ww
                   uh... it's... uh... generally
                   considered desirable in the
                   publishing business to... ah...
                   take certain license in depicting
                   the cover scene... for... ah...
                   purposes involving the... ah,
                   market place.

                            little bill
                   well, mister beauchamp... from
                   what i read of this here book,
                   i'd have to say the writin' ain't
                   a whole lot different from the
                   pitcher.

                                ww
                        (sweating, but with
                             dignity)
                   uh... i can assure you, mister
                   daggett... the events described
                   within are based... on the accounts
                   of eye witnesses and...

                            little bill
                        (opening the book)
                   meaning the duck himself, i guess.

                                ww
                   duke.

                            little bill
                             (harshly)
                   duck, i says.
                          (reading badly)
                   "you have insulted the honor of
                   this beautiful woman, corcoran,"
                   said the duck.  "you must
                   apologize." but two gun corcoran
                   would have none of it and,
                   cursing, he reached for his
                   pistols and would have killed them
                   but the duck was faster and hot
                   lead blazed from his smoking
                   sixguns."
                        (he tosses the book
                     on the desk, disgusted)

                                ww
                          (with dignity)
                   i believe that to be an accurate
                   description of the events, sir...
                   albeit there is a certain poetry
                   to the language which...

                            little bill
                           (standing up)
                   well, mister beauchamp, i was at
                   the blue bottle saloon in wichita
                   the night english bob killed corky
                   corcoran... an' i didn't see you
                   there... nor no woman, nor no
                   two-gun shooters nor nothin'
                   like that.

                                ww
                             (amazed)
                   you were there?

     ww looks to english bob for confirmation but bob's stare
     just gets nastier.

     little bill is warming to the subject though, standing in
     front of the cell.

                            little bill
                   first off... corky didn't carry
                   two pistols, though he should of.

                                ww
                   but he was called...

                            little bill
                   some folks did call old corky "two
                   gun" but not because he was
                   sportin' two pistols but because
                   he had a dick so big it was longer
                   than the barrel on that walker
                   colt he carried.  an' the only
                   insultin' he done was stickin'
                   that big dick of his in some
                   french lady that old bob was sweet
                   on...  well, one day corky walked
                   into the blue bottle and before he
                   knows what's happening bob takes a
                   shot at him... and misses on
                   account of he's drunker than hell.

     ww is fascinated and he looks to bob and bob's eye is
     blazing and he looks back at little bill who is beginning to
     act out the scene.

                            little bill
                   well, that bullet whizzin' by
                   panicked corky, an' he done the
                   wrong thing!  pulled his gun in
                   such a damn hurry he shot off his
                   own toe.  meantime, bob aims good
                   and squeezes off another... but
                   he's so drunk he misses again an'
                   hits the thousand dollar mirror
                   behind the bar.
                   well, now the duck of death is
                   good as dead 'cause this time corky
                   does right an' aims real good, no
                   hurry...

                                ww
                          (beside himself)
                   and?

                            little bill
                   bam!  that walker colt blew up in
                   his hand...  which was a failing
                   common to that model.  now if
                   corky would have really had two
                   guns instead of just a big dick he
                   could have defended himself to the
                   end.

                                ww
                   you... you mean...
                         (looking at bob)
                   english bob killed him while...?

                            little bill
                   well he wasn't gonna wait for
                   corky to grow no new hand.  he
                   walked over real close, bein'
                   drunk, an' shot him through the
                   liver.

     ww stares first at english bob and then at little bill,
     appalled.
