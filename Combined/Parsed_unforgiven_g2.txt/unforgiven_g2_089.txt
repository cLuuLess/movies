     ext. main street - night

     close on ned's face, nose bloodied, eye blackened, as he
     rides down the main street of big whiskey escorted by six
     cowboys (including texas slim, johnny foley and lippy
     macgregor) and clyde and andy.  ned's wrists are tied and he
     looks sullen and... scared.

     little bill and ww beauchamp are standing on the porch of
     the county office when the little group pulls up attended by
     numerous onlookers.  little bill looks ned over coolly as he
     addresses clyde.

                            little bill
                   he tell you where them others is?

                               clyde
                   nope.

                            little bill
                   he give 'em names?

                               clyde
                   didn't give us nothin' but his
                   own name... ned roundtree.

                            little bill
                   well, ned, you'll want to tell me
                   an' mister beauchamp here all
                   about them two villainous friends
                   of yours, i guess.
                        (to clyde and andy)
                   bring him in, boys, for i will be
                   glad to know the names and the
                   whereabouts of those other two
                   murdering sonsofbitches.
