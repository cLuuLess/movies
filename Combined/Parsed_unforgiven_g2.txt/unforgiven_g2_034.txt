                   come on, ww.  let's...

     something's wrong!  there is a funny quiet and ww is frozen
     like a ramrod.  english bob looks around.

     ten yards to bob's right, pointing a 12 gauge shotgun and
     fatty rossiter a few feet away pointing his old enfield.

     view on andy russell

     on bob's left, pale and tense, pointing his henry, and clyde

     view on little bill

     standing ten yards away in the empty dusty street where the
     fourth of july flags are flapping.

                            little bill
                   hullo, bob.  boys, this here is
                   english bob.

                            english bob
                        (under his breath)
                   shit and fried eggs.

                            little bill
                   been a long time, bob.  you run
                   out of chinamen?

                            english bob
                    (recovering his composure)
                   little bill, i thought you were
                   dead.  i see you shaved off your
                   chin whiskers.

                            little bill
                        (feeling his chin)
                   well, i was always tasting the
                   soup two hours after i et it.

     view on the street

     empty, silent.

     alice, kate and little sue in greely's window and, in the
     open doorway, ready to duck for cover, skinny and germany

     view on english bob

                            english bob
                   what i heard was that you fell
                   off your horse drunk and broke
                   your neck.

                            little bill
                   i heard that one myself, bob.
                   hell, i even thought i was dead
                   til i found out it was just i
                   was in nebraska.
                              (pause)
                   who's your friend?

                            english bob
                   ww beauchamp... little bill
                   daggett and... "friends."

                                ww
                             (nervous)
                   from n-n-newton?... and h-hays
                   and a-a-abilene?

                            english bob
                              (dryly)
                   the same.

     charley is taking all this in wide-eyed.

                            little bill
                   you work for the railroads too,
                   mister beauchamp?

                                ww
                         (scared to death)

                   books.  he's my biographer.

                            little bill
                        (fighting amazement)
                   oh.

     and ww is reaching for a pocket.

     view

     andy and charley and clyde and fatty tensing to fire.

     view on english bob

                            english bob
                   i wouldn't do it, ww.

     ww freezes, terrified... and a puddle of urine forms at his
     feet.

                                ww
                   it's only a b-b-b-book...

                            little bill
                      (his pistol half-drawn)
                   a book, huh?
                       (returning his pistol
                     and glancing at the piss)
                   i guess that means you can read...
                   an' i guess you boys seen them
                   signs about surrendering your
                   firearms... but then, like you
                   told old andy there, you ain't
                   armed, are you, bob?

                            english bob
                   not really...
                            (shrugging)
                   maybe a couple of peacemakers...
                            (bargaining)
                   i imagine you could overlook those,
                   eh, bill?  if you didn't see them...
                   or hear them?

                            little bill
                           (cold as ice)
                   i guess not, bob.  i don't like
                   guns around.

     with a sardonic glance at the arsenal trained on him english
     bob gives a shrug and holds open his coat in surrender,
     exposing two fancy holstered pistols.

     little bill gives andy a head signal and andy steps forward
     and takes the pistols from english bob's holsters.

                            little bill
                   charley, see what kind of "books"
                   mister beauchamp is packing...
                   but watch you don't get wet.

                            english bob
                             (to andy)
                   be careful with those, sonny.

     onlookers are stepping out of doorways now and moving
     timidly into the street forming a large semi-circle.  the
     whores are among them.

                              charley
                   no shit, little bill, all he's
                   got is this here book.

     charley holds up a dime novel with a lurid cover showing a
     gentleman in a top hat protecting a woman with his body
     while firing two pistols at seven disheveled looking
     "western types."  the title is "the duke of death."

                            little bill
                       (reading with effort)
                   the... duck of death.

                                ww
                   d-d-d-duke.  the d-d-duke of
                   death.

     english bob starts to go but little bill puts a hand on his
     shoulder.

                            little bill
                   give me the .32, bob.

     furious, english bob turns and looks into bill's eyes and
     then, seeing no alternative, opens his vest esposing a small
     pistol.

                            english bob
                   you leave me at the mercy of my
                   enemies.

                            little bill
                        (taking the pistol)
                   enemies, bob?  you been talking
                   about the queen again?  on
                   independence day?

     a lot of the tension has gone out of the occasion and the
     crowd is beginning to murmur and people are starting to move
     and a couple of kids are running when suddenly...

     crunch! english bob's face seems to cave in with the force
     of little bill's fist and bob literally flies backward and
     slams into the side of the barber shop.

     view

     alice gasping... andy's jaw drops... little sue's eyes
     bulge...  charley gulps.

     view on english bob

     slumped against the wall, blood pouring from his unhinged
     jaw, amazed.

                            english bob
                   wh... what... ?

     little bill walks calmly up to him and wham... kicks him
     hard in the chest.

     view

     silky having a hard time swallowing and mrs. peevey turning
     away and eggs horrified and alice's scared face.

     view on english bob

     bloody, on all fours, pulling a knife from his waistcoat...
     but the whole effort is painful and hopeless.  he hasn't a
     chance.

     little bill looks down at him for a moment from his enormous
     height, watching the smaller man's pitiful effort, then
     slam!... little bill kicks him in the ribs hard and you can
     hear air going out of bob, and bill steps hard on bob's
     knofe hand and the bones crunch loudly.

     view

     ww, white as a ghost and andy is trying not to vomit.  there
     is the sound of another brutal blow.

     view

     english bob on all fours in the dusty street now, barely
     conscious.

     ka-whump! little bill kicks him again, not angrily, but
     hard.

                            little bill
                   i guess you think i'm kickin'
                   you, bob... but it ain't so.
                        (wham, another kick)
                   what i'm doin' is talkin', hear?
                   i'm talkin' to all them villains
                   down in kansas an' them villains
                   in cheyenne...
                              (whump)
                   lettin' em know there ain't no
                   whores' gold...

     little bill turns and looks hard at the whores and alice is
     sick from the violence and little sue is biting her lip and
     silky has tears in her eyes.

                            little bill
                       (turning back to bob
                         and kicking him)
                   ...an' how if there was...
                   how they wouldn't want to come
                   lookin' for it anyhow.

     little bill looks down with eyes as cold as ice and english
     bob grovels in the bloody dust, barely conscious.
