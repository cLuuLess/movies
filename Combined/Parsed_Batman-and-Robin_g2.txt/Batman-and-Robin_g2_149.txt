	freeze is scrambling for his gun.  suddenly a figure looms
	above him.  batman.

555	freeze draws.  batman kicks the gun out of his hand.  the
	two begin to fight on the twirling platform.  a battle of
	titans.

				batman
		you've turned gotham to ice.
				(a right)
		you've endangered countless lives.
				(a left)
		it's payback time.

555a	batman knocks freeze with a mighty punch, hurling him
	onto the back of the telescope.  batman turns towards the
	console, typing commands.

555b	monitor - close.  targeting.  graphic satellites flash
	green.  clock reads:  11:58

555c	the mirrors overhead open, beginning to glow with ambient
	sunlight.

555d	freeze screams at the emerging light, leaping onto
	batman, sending the caped crusader sprawling onto the
	barrel of the telescope.  he advances on the fallen bat.

555e	freeze kicks batman hard in the face, the hero rolling
	down the telescope towards the opening and gotham beyond.
