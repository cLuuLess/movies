142	int. snowy cones ice cream factory

	abandoned.  always freezing.  ice sculpture everywhere.
	freeze walks the bowels of the old factory.

	icemen in parkas and snow bunnies eat frozen dinners,
	guffawing as they watch tv.  the sexiest bunny sidles up
	to freeze.

				ms. b. haven
		freezy, i'm feeling...hot.

				freeze
		i find that unlikely.

				ms. b. haven
		okay, my hair is brittle, my skin
		is dry and i don't care.  i'd
		weather blizzards to have you.
		you're the most perfect man i've
		ever known.

				freeze
		to be frozen.  to never change.  a
		life of perpetual ice-olation.
		there is little perfection in that.

				ms. b. haven
			(pushing closer)
		what say we turn up the heat?

				freeze
		you're skating on thin ice.  my
		passion thaws for my bride alone.

				ms. b. haven
		forget your frosty femme.  these lips
		are wet and ready to get frostbite.

				freeze
		hop away little bunny.  before i
		cool your jets.  permanently.

	the bunny storms off.

				freeze
		i wonder how cold i can get my
		shower...frosty!

	freeze's faithful aide, frosty, appears by his side.

				freeze
		everyone is always having a good
		time.  except me.  try as i might,
		can find no pleasure.  perhaps my
		heart truly has turned to ice.

143	freeze lifts his gun and fires, freezing frosty solid.

				freeze
		well, that was fun.  there's hope for
		me yet.

143a	freeze stares at his frozen aide a beat, changes the
	setting on his gun and fires, a thawing beam melting
	frosty so he stands now, soaked and dripping like a wet cat.

143b	freeze turns on his heel.  frosty follows him past
	mounting files of research.  scrawled schematics  an icy
	workshop.

				freeze
		do you think i'm mad, frosty?

				frosty
			(wringing out his sleeves)
		that's really a judgment call, boss.

145	a flashing display on his suit watch reads low power.

				freeze
		battling the bat exhausted my power.

	from a safe, freeze takes three small diamonds, place
	them in the suit compartment.  his power levels spike to
	normal.

				freeze
		but i was successful nevertheless.

146	freeze continues to a pedestal atop which sits a machine
	powered by two giant diamonds.  slots for two more diamonds
	are empty.  he removes the giant stolen diamond from within
	his tunic, place the gem in an empty third slot.

				freeze
		one more giant diamond of this size
		and my freezing cannon will be
		complete.  i will hold gotham ransom.
		unless the city bows to my demands,
		it's winter forever here in goat-town.
		the city fathers will have no choice
		but to give me the billions i need
		to complete my research, to find the
		cure for...

146	freeze has come to a frozen wall.

				freeze
		leave us.  we need quality time.

148	as frosty exits in the b.g., freeze enters a walk-in
	freezer, lifts a frozen dinner box.  a secret vault opens.
	freezes steps into...

148a	int. freeze's subterranean cold vault

	within, a computerized glacier-like sarcophagus bears his
	frozen wife, a snowflake pendant around her neck.

				freeze
			(touches the glass)
		soon we will be together once more.

	freeze turns towards his research, heading back to work.

				freeze
		nothing frustrates a man like a 
		frigid wife.
