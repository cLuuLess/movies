203	int. gotham botanical gardens - greenhouse - night

	a hanging banner reads gotham charity flower ball.  a
	giant beast mask covers the entrance.  drummers stomp on
	congo drums.  guests dress as flowers.  two costumed
	gorillas romp about the room.

203a	batman and robin stand by the stage.

				robin
		you think freeze will take the bait?

				batman
		he'll be here.

203b	atop the stairs.  the two gorillas have converged on the
	drummers.  one begins dancing around, covertly knocking
	the drummers unconscious with his paws.

204	on stage.  the mc walks out, followed by gossip gerty.

				mc
		ladies and gentlemen.  gossip gerty
		of good morning gotham and i welcome
		you to the gem of our evening.

204	two armed guards emerge bearing a palette upon which
	hangs a silver necklace supporting a perfect, grapefruit
	sized diamond.

				gossip gerty
		the famed heart of isis, on loan
		from the collection of my close,
		personal friend bruce wayne.

	the mc gestures and several woman step forward dressed as
	flowers, each more strikingly gorgeous than the next.

				mc
		tonight, on auction, an opportunity
		to dine with one of our fabulous
		flowers, the famed diamond draped
		around her neck.

				gossip gerty
		ooo, look at all these luscious
		lovelies.  let's start the bidding.

				man #1
		ten thousand for chrysanthemum.

				man #2
		twenty thousand for lilac.

				man #3
		thirty thousand for rose.

				gossip gerty
		boys, please.  show some gusto.

205	the top of the stairs.  one gorilla begins to beat the
	drums.  the other removes her paw mitts.  her gorilla's
	head.  from within her gorilla costume, steps a vision.
	skin tight green costume made of leaves.  green boots and
	mask.  magenta hair.  glowing green eyes.  meet poison ivy,
	simply the most beautiful woman known to man.

205a	robin-close.  smiles.

				robin
		gorilla my dreams.

206	ivy lifts her green gloved hands, both filled with piles
	of sparkling dust, blows the powder over the startled
	patrons.

207	follow the dust as it spins out in fairy-like spirals,
	curling through the crowd.

208	the crowd - various shots.  folks blink their eyes,
	suddenly bewitched, as ivy tilts backwards, falling into
	the arms of several jungle clad men on the ballroom floor.

209	ivy saunters over a bridge made of the backs of kneeling
	men, through the parting crowd, towards batman and robin.

				ivy
		hi there.

				mc
			(sputtering)
		and you are...

				ivy
		poison.  poison ivy.

210	batman - close.  dazed.  like a man who's drunk a quart of
	love potion.  he takes her hand.

				ivy
		why not send junior to bed early, i
		could come and take your measurements?

	ivy turns now to robin, offers the other hand.  she blows
	another volley of dust into robin's face.

				ivy
		on the other hand, youth does have
		its advantages.  endurance.  stamina.

211	robin - close.  also suddenly smitten, perhaps even
	harder.

				ivy
		why settle for second place?  robin
		is a sidekick, a junior partner.  if
		we were a team, you'd be the star.
		forget the geriatric bat.   come, join
		me, my garden needs tending.

	the two help her up onto stage.  she turns to the
	mesmerized mc.

				ivy
		i'll take it from here, pal.

	ivy lifts the diamond, places it around her neck.

				ivy
		some lucky boy's about to hit the
		honey pot.  i'll include an evening
		of my company for the winner.  i'll
		bring everything you see here.  plus
		everything you don't.
			(off batman and robin)
		and i'll bring my imagination.

				man #1
		50 thousand for poison ivy - -

				man #2
		100 thousand for poison ivy - -

				batman
		one million - -

				robin
			(sotto voce)
		you own it.
			(loud)
		two million - -

	the two lock eyes.

				batman
			(sotto voce)
		you don't have two million.
				(loud)
		three million - -

				robin
			(sotto voce)
		i'll borrow it from you.
			(loud)
		four million - -

				ivy
		you two boys aren't going to fight
		over little old me, are you?

	batman reaches to his utility belt, draws a batarang.

				batman
		five million - -

	robin reaches to his utility belt, pulls a throwing bird.

				robin
		six million - -

				gossip gerty
		is it getting nippy in here?

212	the teeth of the giant mask explose as freeze's truck
213	smashes into the room from an elevated bridge beyond.
214	standing atop the vehicle, backed by swirling mists,
	freeze, his icemen following behind.

				freeze
			(drawing his gun)
		did i use the wrong door again?

215	batman hurls his batarang, knocking freeze's pistol free.
	batman and robin race forward, engulfed by the rushing
	force of icemen.

	his pistol flies into the hands of one of the guests.  a thug
	rams the guest from behind, the gun bouncing into the air.

215a	a swarm of armed security guards and guests swamp freeze.

215b				freeze
		when technology fails...brute force.

215c	freeze moves like lightning, smashing guards with mighty
	punches, whipping guests flying across the room.

	freeze's pistol bounces from guest, to thug, to guest like
	a wildly fumbled football, a thug finally tipping the soar-
	ing gun back towards freeze.

215d				freeze
		alright, everyone, chill!

216	freeze fires, turning a few guests and several exotic
	flower arrangements into ice.

				freeze
		i should have been a decorator.

217	freeze starts for the stage.

218	batman and robin are in mid-melee, fighting off an army
	of icemen.

219	batman smashes one thug three times in the chin.

220	robin does a spinning side kick to another approaching
	villain, then ducks, sending one villain crashing into
	another.

221	batman grabs a thug, throws him to robin, who punches
	him back to batman who punches him back to robin.

222	both punch him simultaneously, the thug flying back
	through the air.  they begin fighting their way towards
	the stage.

223	freeze climbs onto the stage to face poison ivy.

				freeze
		let me guess, plant girl? vine lady?
		ms. moss?

				ivy
		listen, captain cold, the suit, maybe,
		even though silver went out in the
		70's.  but those boots are unforgivable.
		what is it with men?

				freeze
		i'd love to stand here all day and
		exchange fashion tips but i'm kind
		of pressed for time.  so hand over
		the diamond, garden gal, or i turn
		you into mulch.

	ivy pulls a handful of dust from her belt-pouch, blows it
	towards him.  the dust swirls around his helmet.  ivy
	frowns.

				freeze
		pheromone dust.  designed to heat a
		man's blood.  doesn't work on the
		cold hearted.  now, if you please...

	freeze extends his gloved hand.

				ivy
		well, if you insist.

	ivy hands him the diamond.

				freeze
		clever little clover.

224	just then one of the thugs flies across the room,
	shashing into the back of the stage.

				freeze
		that's my exit cue.

	freeze races for his truck.

225	batman and robin dispatch the last iceman, make for the
	stage.

				batman
			(to gordon)
		you have eleven minutes to thaw those
		guests, commissioner.

226	batman and robin race after the escaping freeze and his
	men.

227	ivy stares after them.  she lifts a small souvenir.  a tiny
	glass globe that says welcome to gotham.  shakes the
	bauble, the tiny city within suddenly covered by snow.
	gordon appears behind her.

				gordon
		miss ivy, you've just met one of
		the most sinister men in gotham.

				ivy
		that's no man.  that's a god!

	gordon moves off as the second gorilla arrives on stage,
	removes his mask.  bane.

				ivy
		enough monkey business.  we've got
		work to do.
