129	int. batcave - night

	bruce stands with dick, now wrapped in a blanket, steaming
	mug in hand, watching the main monitor.

		gotham university labs.  security
		video.  two years ago.

130	screen - close.  the image of a dazzling hi-tech lab-
	oratory.  a beautiful young woman (nora fries) lays on
	a gurney.  a scientist works a bank of controls over a
	smoking vat of cryonic solution.  handsome, the intense
	gaze of genius, the man freeze once was.

				bruce
		dr. victor fries  two time olympic
		decathelete.  nobel prize winner in
		molecular biology. after his wife
		contracted a rare disease, mcgregor's
		syndrome, he hoped to freeze her in
		cryogenic sleep until he could
		discover a cure.  here's where
		everything goes north.

	alarms flash.  a panel explodes. fries is blown into the
	vat of cryogenic solution.

				bruce
		that liquid is fifty below.

	fries screams, engulfed in the mists of the cryonic
	solution, his skin now frozen, bluish, his hair brittle,
	all but gone.

				dick
		that's gotta hurt.

				bruce
		somehow he survived.  but the
		cryoslution mutated his body.

131	the display shows a turning schematic of fries.

				dick
		what happened to his wife?

				bruce
		presumed dead.  no one knows.

	the display now shows a turning mr. freeze.  compartments
	in both suit sleeves are highlighted, flashing diamond
	shapes within.

				bruce
		he needs extreme cold to survive.
		his cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced
		lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

				dick
		let me get this straight. a
		brilliant citizen, disfigured by a
		horrible accident, re-emerges as a
		psychotic super-villain bent on
		theft, revenge and destruction.
		you see a pattern here?

				bruce
<		maybe it's something in the water.

	bruce returns dick's smile.

				bruce
		well, if it's ice the iceman
		wants...alfred!
