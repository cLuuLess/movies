506	robin puts his hands together and yells.  the echo shoots
	up the hill.  a tremendous rumbling comes back down, the
	overhang of snow dumping on several icemen.

508	robin does a standing backflip into the thugs behind him.

509	batgirl goes down, taking out several more with a deft leg 
	sweep.

	icemen up towards the observatory.
