350	int. blossom street turkish baths - dawn

	transformed.  sunlight streams in through the broken
	ceiling.  the ground thrives, now a rich garden.

351	ivy enters, strolls through the gardens into a small
352	ante-room where freeze sits over his freezing engine,
	having zapped the walls with his pistol, the room now
	a world of ice.

				ivy
		make yourself right at home.

				freeze
		where is my wife?

				ivy
		there was nothing i could do.  batman
		deactivated her.  she's dead.

				freeze
		you lie!

353	freeze lunges for ivy.  bane steps between them.  mistake.
	freeze hurls him across the room.  ivy stills bane with a
	gesture.

				ivy
		i'm sorry.

	ivy reaches up, holding the snowflake necklace between her
	and the looming freeze.  freeze stops, takes the chain in
	his hand.

				freeze
		their bones will turn to ice.  their
		blood will freeze in my hands.

				ivy
		kill them.  of course.  but why stop
		there?  why should only batman and
		robin die while the society that
		created them goes unpunished?

	ivy lifts the frozen gotham bauble off the iced table.
	turns it over in her hand absentmindedly.  freeze stares at
	her.

				freeze
		yes.  i shall replay the world
		for sentencing me to a life without
		the warmth of human comfort.  i will
		blanket the city in endless winter.
		first gotham and then the world.

				ivy
		just what i had in mind.  everything
		dead on earth except us.  a chance
		for mother nature to start again.
			(she lifts a flower)
		plants and flowers are the oldest
		species on the planet yet they are
		defenseless against man.  sorry hon,
		this is for science.
			(she crushes the flower)
		behold the dawn of a new age.

	from a canisters labeled project gilgamesh, ivy removes a
	savage, other-worldly plant with hissing fangs.

				ivy
		i have created a race of plants
		with the strength of the deadliest
		animals.  once you have frozen
		mankind, my mutants will overrun
		the globe.  the earth will become
		a brave new world of only plants.
		and we shall rule them.  for we
		will be the only two people left
		in the world.

				freeze
		adam and evil.

	freeze lifts the gotham bauble, holds it on his palm, his
	gauntlet glowing blue, tiny gotham freezing.  he crushes the
	city.

				freeze
		you will distract the bat and bird
		while i prepare to freeze gotham.

				ivy
		can't we just ice them along with
		the rest of the citizenry?

				freeze
		that is far too merciful.  batman
		will watch his beloved gotham perish,
		then i will kill him.

				ivy
		as a team, the duncely duo protect
		each other.  but the robin is young.
		impetuous.  if i could get him alone-

				freeze
		one kiss and you could lift the mask
		from his lifeless face.  their secret
		identities would be revealed.  but
		how best to bait a brid?

				ivy
		the way to a boy's heart is through
		his ego.  what strapping young hero
		could resist his very own...signal?

				freeze
		inspired, ms. ivy.

				ivy
		i'm hungry.  i think i'll have poultry.
