597	int. wayne manor - living room - dawn

	world war iii was lost in this room.  strewn clothes.
	barbara dozes on the couch.  dick paces.  bruce stands,
	staring out the window, afraid he has lost alfred forever.

	(over) a throat clears.  louder.

	all look up.  alfred is descending the stairs.  scowling.

				bruce
		alfred, are you...?

				alfred
		rather disappointed at how poorly
		i taught you proper housekeeping.
				(a beat)
		and quite well, it seems.  thanks
		to you, son.  thanks to you all.

	the three move to him.  a family reunion.  dick turns to
	bruce.

				dick
		one question.  when batgirl and i
		rolled off the telescope, how
		come you didn't try and save us?
		it was the first time i fell and
		you weren't there to catch me.

				bruce
		i knew you could handle it.

	barbara clears her throat.  dick shoots her a look.

				bruce
		sometimes counting on someone else
		is the only way to win.

				barbara
		hey, i'm the one who kicked ivy's
		botanical butt.  personally.  me.  i did.

				bruce
		you are going back to school.

				dick
		you're never going to win this
		argument, bruce.

	barbara extends her hand.

				barbara
		partners?

	a beat.  the other heroes follow suit.  a team is born.

				bruce & dick
		partners.

				alfred
		we're going to need a bigger cave.
