	robin shakes off the blow, looks up to see batgirl fending
	off bane with a fast series of punches and kicks.  she might

580b				batgirl

	just then bane slams her into an ice wall by the throat, rears
	back with his fist, about to deliver the killing blow.

		no.  i've got him.

580c	robin leaps, ripping off the tubes leading from bane's
	injector pack to his skull, venom spraying wildly into the
	air.

580d	bane hits the snow, writing, as the venom effect is
	reversed.  his muscles shrink, his form diminishing until
	he is again a scrawny prisoner, struggling in the folds of
	his costume.
