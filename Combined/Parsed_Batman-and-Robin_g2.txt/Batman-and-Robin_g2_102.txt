346	int. freeze's lair

	police tagged and tapped.  batman and robin examine
	freeze's lab.  commissioner gordon enters, drops a video
	disk in a console player.

				gordon
		there's no sign he came back here
		after the escape.  we pulled this
		off the surveillance cameras at
		arkham.

346a	monitor - close.  the three villains daring aerial escape.
	batman hits a switch.  the image of ivy fills the screen.

				robin
		she's definitely part of this.  it's
		weird, for a while ivy was all i
		could think about.  but then...

				batman
		i know.  the feeling just vanished.

				robin
		i can't believe we were fighting
		over a  bad guy.

				batman
		bad, yes.  guy, no.  this is one
		majorly beautiful evil person.

				robin
		i'm totally over her.  positively.

				batman
		me too.  great stems, though.

				robin
		umm-hmmmm.			

				batman
		definitely.

	batman has gone to the walk-in freezer.  examines a wall of
	food.  he lifts a frozen oriental dinner.  the secret vault
	swings open.

				robin
		how did you...?

				batman
				(off the box)
		open sesame...chicken.

346b	int. freeze's vault

	batman and robin enter, examine nora fries in her
	sarcophagus.

				batman
		she's still alive.  he's adapted his
		freezing technology to reverse
		mcgregor's syndrome.
			(off a scrolling monitor)
		he's even found a cure for the early
		stages of the disease.

				robin
		can he save her?

				batman
		no.  her case is too advanced.  but
		maybe, someday, with more research-

346b	fairy-like spirals begin winding through the room.
	batman and robin, both dazed, follow the dust through a
	snaking passage, wrench open two service doors to reveal...

346c	int. snowy cones factory - industrial basement

	bane stands atop a staircase overlooking an industrial
	basement crisscrossed by catwalks above giant mixing vats
	and conveyer belts.  he hits a switch, the machinery whirring
	to life.

				batman
		no beauty...

				robin
		just the beast.

	batman rushes the monster.  bane sideswipes him, sending him
	flying off the stairs towards the basement below.

	robin uses batman's distraction to smash into bane's chest.
	robin bounces off, landing hard atop the landing.

				robin
		ouch.
				(standing)
		anymore at home like you?

	the two begin to fight atop the stairs.

346d	int. snowy cones ice cream factory

	the front doors blow open.  gordon and the cops stare up
	to face mr. freeze, standing atop the steps.

				freeze
		i hate uninvited guests.

	the cops race up the stairs towards freeze.  he pulls a lever
	marked coolant gas.  vents around the room begin to hiss blue
	freezing gas.

346e	int. snowy cones industrial basement

	batman has landed in a giant ice cream mixer.  he rolls clear
	of the giant stirring arm, flipping out of the vat to face...
	poison ivy.  she smiles, blows a handful of dust into his face.

				ivy
		i must confess, the combination of
		heroic daring-do and an anatomically
		correct rubber suit puts fire in a 
		girl's...lips.

	she leans in to kiss him.  batman stares a beat, shakes it
	off.

				batman
		why do all the gorgeous ones have to
		be homicidal maniacs?  is it me?

346f	batman - pov.  bane is spinning robin over his head.
	batman races up the steps towards his partner.

346g	int. snowy cones factory

	the cops are fighting through the hissing coolant gas
	towards freeze at the top of the stairs.  freeze reaches
	for another lever.

				freeze
		why don't you boys slip into
		something more comfortable?

346h	the icy stpes - close.  snap into a steep, curving ramp.

	freeze punches the lead cop backwards into his shivering
	cohorts, the police tumbling in a slipping pile down to
	the floor below.

346i	int. industrial basement - top of stairs

	bane hurls robin down the steps.  batman smashes into bane,
	both falling off the platform, taking their fight to a catwalk below.

346j	int. basement floor

	robin stands, behind him a giant miller's wheel carries
	planks of wood through a chopper and back up as pallets
	of popsicle sticks.

				ivy (over)
		her pretty birdie.

	robin spins to face ivy.  she blows a pile of dust into his
	face.  she begins advancing, backing him towards the chopper
	blades.

				robin
		give it up.  if you threw yourself-

				ivy
			(leaning in)
		at you?  polly want a kiss?

	she leans in, lips pursed.

346k	on the catwalk overhead bane's mighty blows back batman
	towards the edge of the catwalk.

	robin looks from ivy to batman, grabs a strut on the miller's
	wheel, the giant cog lifting him up towards the catwalk and
	his partner.

				ivy
		i must be losing my touch.

346l	int. snowy cones factory

	freeze is striding through the mists towards his diamond
	vault.  more cops rush him from the hissing gas.

	freeze moves like lightning, whipping billy clubs from the
	holsters of two police, using them like disconnected nunchucks, 
	knocking the cops unconscious in a flurry of slams and jabs.

				freeze
		stick around.

	a cop hits the wall.  beside him a button reads;  emergency
	heat.  he slams the stud, filaments coming to life, the room
	glowing red.

	freeze's watch begins to flash.  no power.

346m	int. catwalk

	bane kicks batman off the end of the catwalk as robin leaps
	onto the villain.  robin and bane begin fighting again.

346n	int. conveyor belt

	batman lands on his back on a moving belt that is feeding
	ancient tubs of ice cream into a clown shaped flash freezer.
	ivy jumps atop the caped crusader, their faces close.

				ivy
		you bring out the animal in me.

				batman
		i should have brought my leash.

				ivy
		enough sweet talk.

	with that ivy blows another handful of dust into batman's
	face.  ivy licks her lips.  leans in for a kiss.

	at the last second, batman averts his face, wrenching ivy
	to the floor just ahead of the clown's freezing maw.

				batman
			(mustering all his will)
		you're going to jail.

				ivy
		i'm a lover not a fighter.  that's
		why every poison ivy action figure
		comes complete with...him.

	bane stands atop a giant storage vat, a dazed robin hanging
	in his hand.  bane tosses the boy aside, slide, feet first,
	down a conveyer belt and double fists batman, crashing,
	into the wall.

				ivy
		i'm off to find bachelor number two.
		try not to make a mess when you die.

346o	int. snowy cones ice cream factory

	the room is growing even hotter.  freeze stagger towards
	his diamond vault, his flesh turning ray.

	with his last strength, freeze wrenches open his safe,
	filling his sleeve power compartments with diamonds, his
	color returning.

				freeze
		ahh.  chilled to perfection.

	freeze hits his watch, the villain now suddenly encased
	in ice.

346p	wider

	the cops are warming back into action, draw guns, fire,
	bullets bouncing off freeze's armor of ice, ricocheting
	into the walls.

				freeze
		superman, eat your heart out.

	freeze starts towards his weapons locker.

346q	int. industrial basement

	bane smashes batman into the wall.  advances.  at the last
	second, batman fires a batclub, hitting bane in the head
	stunning him.

346r	batman - pov.  ivy is closing in on robin.

346s	int. snowy cones ice cream factory

	the cops rush freeze.  the villain whips a small icing jewel
	from his weapons locker, the floor glows, suddenly covered
	with ice.

	the cops begin slipping on the glassy floor in classic
	keystone style, ending up sprawled on their backs.

	freeze stands, pulsing with power, this icing cannon now
	under one arm.  he lifts his pistol in his free hand.  points
	at the police.

				freeze
		all right coppers, freeze.

	he fires.

346t	int. industrial basement

	ivy has robin up against a giant vat.

				ivy
		stop living in the shadow of the
		big bad bat.  you don't need him.
			(blows more dust)
		you deserve your own legend.  your
		own bright shining signal in the
		sky.  let me guide you.  let me...
			(touches his face)
		...touch you.  kiss you.

	he can't resist, about to kiss her.  a tiny batarang hits
	his cheek.

				batman
		remember the victim at the airport.
		toxins introduced through the mouth.

				robin
		what are you talking about?

				batman
		why is she so desperate to kiss us?
		i'm betting her lips are poison.

				robin
		a poison kiss?  you have some real
		issues with women, you know that?
			(advancing)
		you just couldn't stand that she
		was about to kiss me.
			(shoves him)
		couldn't stand that something might
		be mine and not yours.  could you?!

	robin shoves him harder still.  in frustration, batman
	delivers a fantastic roundhouse, sending robin smashing
	into a wall.

				batman
		damn.

	batman tries to help robin up.  robin shrugs him off, stands.

				robin
		ivy's right.  i don't need you.  i'm
		going solo.  i want my own signal
		in the sky.

	batman looks around.  ivy and bane are gone.

				gordon
				(arriving)
		what happened?  how'd they get away?

	but the caped crusader doesn't have an answer.
