149	int. limbo - night

	robin is fighting mr. freeze and his cronies.  robin
	delivers a fast set of spinning kicks to the thugs,
	felling them like toys.

150	a thug carrying a large diamond breaks free, racing away.
	robin leaps for the escaping thug, putting his back to
	freeze.

151	freeze raises his joined fists high above robin's head,
	coming down fast.  robin is done for.

152	suddenly batman swing out of the dark, his boots flying
	into freeze's chest, sending the villain hard to the
	ground.

153	batman drops to freeze's chest, hammers a series of
	punches into his tunic, rendering him unconscious.  batman
	looks up at robin.

154				batman
		we'll be starting again now.

155	just then freeze's hand shoots up, grabbing batman by the
	throat.

156				batman
		pause virtual reality simulation.

	push in as batman reaches towards his cowl.  screen wipes
	to reveal...

157	bruce wayne - close.  pulls off a pair of vr goggles.

	wider

	bruce and dick, also in vr goggles, stand on an empty
	platform in the back of the batcave.

				dick
		i got the diamond.  quell problemo, bruce?

				bruce
		you left your back wide open.  freeze
		could have killed you.

158	dick demonstrates a spinning back kick that would have
	dropped freeze in his tracks.

				dick
		i had it covered.

	(over) a doorbell rings.

				dick
		you know, in the circus, the flying
		graysons were a team.  we had to
		trust each other.  we had to count
		on each person to do his part.  that's
		what being partners is all about.
				(loud)
		end simulation.

159	ambient lights come up in the cave.

160				dick
		sometimes counting on someone else
		is the only way to win.

	(over) the doorbell rings again.

				dick
				(puzzled)
		where's al?

	dick heads for the door.

				bruce
				(following)
		couldn't we just for once pretend
		that i'm the teacher and you're the
		student?
