562	int. observatory

	batman is tumbling towards the open slat and gotham below.

565	he slows his fall, stopping on the barrel.

				voice (over)
		wow.  batman.

	wider.  the two scientists are clinging to a targeting groove
	along the body of the barrel.

				scientist
		i've seen you on tv.

566	batman - pov.  freeze is heading back to the control
	panel.

				batman
		nice to meet you.  can you give me
		any more height on this thing?

567	the scientist reaches down to a red emergency lever.

				scientist
		going up.

568	he pulls the lever and the telescope tilts straight up,
569	sending batman soaring into the air towards the dome
	above.

570	batman flips in mid air, dives, smashing directly into
	freeze, the villain crashing over the edge of the control
	platform and into the freezing engine.

571	the mirrors overhead align, the beams of sunlight hitting
	the freezing engine.

	freeze is struck by the rays, the sun penetrating his
	damaged suit.

571a	the telescope activates, a powerful thawing beam shooting
	from it's giant lens.

572	batman turns to freeze, the villain beginning to gray and
	wither.

				batman
		you're loosing your cool

				freeze
		i think not.  there'll be no hot
		time in this old town tonight.
			(pulls a remote)
		you'll get a charge out of this.

573	he presses a button.  as freeze rolls out of the sunlight,
	falling towards the floor below, charges around the tele-
	scope base explode.

574	the telescope tilts, dropping out of the open slat
	towards gotham, taking a chunk of observatory floor with
	it.
