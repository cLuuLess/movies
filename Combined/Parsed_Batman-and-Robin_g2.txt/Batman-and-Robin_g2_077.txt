269	int. batcave - night

	bruce and dick argue.

				dick
		i could have made the jump.

				batman
		you could have splattered your
		brains on the side of the building.

				dick
		this is no partnership.  you're never
		going to trust me.

				batman
		trust you?  you can't even keep
		your head on the job.  all you could
		think about was poison ivy.

				dick
		you just can't stand that she
		might have wanted me instead of
		you; that's your idea of friendship,
		isn't it, bruce?  you have to have
		everything.  your house.  your rules.
		your way or the highway.  it's
		batman and robin not robin and
		batman.  i'm sick of it.

	dick is right up in bruce's face.

				bruce
		yes it's my rules.  my rules that
		keep us alive.  and if you want to
		stay in this house and on this
		team then you'll abide by them.
