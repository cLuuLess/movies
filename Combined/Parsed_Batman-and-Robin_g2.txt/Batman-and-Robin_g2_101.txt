343	int. limo - night

	filled with flowers.  bane sits at the wheel, ivy and freeze
	in back, watching the snowy cones ice cream factory,
	surrounded now by a police perimeter.

				freeze
		my reserves are exhausted.  i must
		have the gems that power my suit.

				ivy
		you are looking unseasonably hot.
		let's go inside and grab your rocks.

	the batmobile screeches up.  batman and robin race inside.

				freeze
		in my weakened state i am no match
		for the bat and the bird.

				ivy
		you leave batman and robin to me.

	freeze looks skeptical.  ivy smiles seductively.

				ivy
		trust me.  vegetable magnetism.

				freeze
		fine.  while i retrieve my diamonds,
		you and meatloaf will bring my wife
		to your lair.  she's frozen in -

				ivy
		hold it.  you never said anything
		about a wife, frozen or otherwise-

	freeze moves fast, grabbing her neck, smashing her against
	the seat back.  bane moves in but ivy shoos him off with a
	gesture.

				freeze
		you will rescue my wife

				ivy

		where do i find your brittle bride?
