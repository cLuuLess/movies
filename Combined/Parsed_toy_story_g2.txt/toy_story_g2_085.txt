realizing that buzz is missing.  he looks back to discover
buzz stuck in the fence.

                         buzz
            just go!  i'll catch up!

the van begins pulling out of the driveway.

woody tugs on a loosened slat and breaks buzz free of the
fence.

van driving off down the street.

the moving van

drives right over them.  woody and buzz scream, ducking just
in time.

after the truck passes, buzz runs after it with woody a few
steps behind.

                         buzz
            come on!

moving truck.
