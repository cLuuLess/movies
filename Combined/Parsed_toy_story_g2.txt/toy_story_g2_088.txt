int. back of moving truck

woody rips into one of andy's boxes.

angle: inside of box

all the toys wince and moan as they cover their eyes from
the sudden brightness.

                         toys
            what?!

                         rex
            are we there already?

                         slinky
            woody?!  how'd you --

woody's response is to slide the box aside and begin
rummaging through the next box.

slinky, potato head, rex and the other toys grumble in
confusion as they poke their heads up out of the first box.

                         woody
            ah-hah!  there you are!!

woody pulls the rc car and its remote out of the second box.

                         mr. potato head
            hey!  what's he doing?

woody runs to the back of the truck and throws the rc car
out onto the street.  the other toys scream in horror.

                         rex
            he's at it again!

intercut - ext. street/int. rear of moving truck

woody turns on the remote and steers the rc car past scud
and under the parked car where buzz is hiding.

rc's motor whirrs happily at the sight of buzz.

the traffic light turns green allowing the van and truck to
cross the intersection.

                         mr. potato head
                   (pointing at woody)
            get him!!!

all the toys pour out of their boxes and charge on woody.

                         woody
            ah-h!!  ah-h!  no, no!

woody continues to steer the remote while trying to avoid
the angry mob of toys.

buzz jumps on to the rc car and they zoom back towards the
moving truck.

scud is right on their heels and is about to chomp down on
buzz --

rocky picks up woody and spins him over his head.

                         woody
            no, no, no!  wait!
                   (as rocky spins him)
            whoa-whoa-whoa...!

-- the rc car suddenly swerves from scud's jaws and starts
doing doughnuts (matching woody's) in the middle of the street.

                         buzz
                   (spinning)
            whoa-whoa-whoa...!

rocky throws woody to the floor.

-- rc resumes his course straight down the street with scud
giving close chase.

hamm leaps off a pile of boxes and onto woody.

                         hamm
            pig pile!!

-- the rc car hops up in the air, tossing buzz up and off.
buzz manages to land back on rc, but facing backwards.

angle: traffic light

it changes red again and the wall of cross traffic resumes.

buzz and the rc car drive straight into it.

scud blindly follows them into the traffic and skids to a
halt just missing a car.  the car swerves and crashes into
another car.  soon there is a multi-car pile up that
encircles scud, entrapping the dog.

buzz and the rc car emerge from the intersection safely on
the other side.
