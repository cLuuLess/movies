woody has created a little diagram of the house and yard out
of dominoes and scrabble tiles.  he points to it with a
pencil as he addresses the mutants.

                         woody
            all right, listen up.  i need pump
            boy here -- ducky here.  legs?

legs, the toy fishing rod with fashion doll legs, steps
forward from the crowd.

                         woody
                   (continued; to legs)
            you're with ducky.
                   (to the others)
            rollerbob and i don't move till we
            get the signal.  clear?

the mutants all give an affirmative nod.

                         woody
            okay, let's move!

the toys all break.

legs and ducky, a duck head pez dispenser with baby doll
torso and plunger base, rush over to a heating grate and
pull the face plate off the wall.  they disappear into the
heating duct.
