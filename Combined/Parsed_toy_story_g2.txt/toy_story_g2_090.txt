sfx: car horn

woody turns around and ducks just in time as a car passes
over him.

shaken, woody tries to get up again when...

buzz & rc

come barreling towards him.

                         buzz
            who-o-o-oa!  woody!

the rc car sweeps up woody and keeps driving.

woody finds himself sitting in front of buzz (still holding
the remote).

                         woody
            well, thanks for the ride.

                         buzz
                   (pointing ahead)
            look out!!

the toys are about to slam into the rear tire of the car
that had passed over woody earlier.

woody screams and gives the steering wheel on the remote a
hard left, missing the tire by inches.  the rc car moves up
under the car.

                         woody
            now let's catch up to that truck!

angle: rc remote

woody flicks a switch from "on" to "turbo."

the rc car speeds up towards the moving truck.
