int. crane game - continuous

woody clambers up the side of the deposit slot.

                         buzz (o.s.)
            this is an intergalactic emergency!
            i need to commandeer your vessel to
            sector 12!

woody peeks over the partition to witness buzz surround by
the cute alien toys.

                         buzz
                   (continued; to the aliens)
            who's in charge here?

all the aliens point upward.

                         aliens
            the cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!

woody and buzz look up.

angle: crane game claw

it dangles directly above the toys.

                         alien #1
            the claw is our master.

                         alien #2
            the claw chooses who will go and
            who will stay.

                         woody
                   (to himself)
            this is ludicrous.

                         sid (o.s.)
                   (laughter)

woody gasps at the recognition of sid's voice.  he turns to
see sid heading straight for the crane game.

                         woody
            oh, no!  sid!!!

woody leaps off the partition and tackles buzz, pushing the
two of them deep into the pile of aliens.

                         woody
            get down!!

sid approaches the crane game and fishes quarters out of his
pants pocket.

                         buzz
                   (loud whisper)
            what's gotten into you, sheriff?  i
            was --

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            you are the one that decided to
            climb into this --

                         alien #4
                   (loud whisper)
            sh-h-h-h-h-h.  the claw.  it moves.

angle: claw

it moves into position and hovers directly above the area
where woody and buzz are hiding.

the crane drops and grabs hold of the alien toy that is
right on top of buzz.

                         alien #3
                   (whispering excitedly)
            i have been chosen!!

positioned with his back to sid, the alien is lifted up by
the claw.

                         alien #3
                   (continued)
            farewell, my friends!  i go on to a
            better place.

                         sid
            gotcha!

with the alien gone, buzz's upper torso becomes exposed,
forcing the space ranger to freeze.  sid suddenly spots buzz.

                         sid
            a buzz lightyear!  no way!

woody, still hidden, frantically looks around for some way
to escape.  behind him, through the aliens, he eyes...

a small repair door

woody swims through the alien squeeze toys toward the door.
he grabs hold of the locking latch and, after a few
attempts, is able to pry the door open.

the shadow of the crane lines up over buzz, lowers, and
grabs his head.

                         sid
            yes!

the claw begins to lift buzz up.

                         woody
                   (gasp)
            buzz, no!

woody grabs hold of buzz's feet.

woody and the claw begin to have a tug-of-war with buzz.

woody pulls down hard, forcing buzz to sink into the pile of
aliens, out of sid's view.

                         sid
                   (slamming his fist
                   against the glass)
            wha -- ?  hey!!

still tugging against the crane, woody is almost out the
door with buzz.  just then, the aliens at the bottom of the
pile pull buzz and woody back inside.

                         alien #4
            he has been chosen.

                         woody
            hey!  what are you doing?

                         alien #5
            he must go.

                         woody
            stop it, you -- !  stop it, you
            zealots!

                         aliens
            he must go!  do not fight the claw!
            do not anger the claw!  he has been
            chosen.

woody and buzz are pushed up to the surface and into the
air, dangling lifelessly in front of sid.

                         sid
            alright!  double prizes!

woody and buzz are dropped into the prize door slot and
snatched up by sid.

                         sid
                   (looking at his two
                   new toys)
            let's go home and...play.  ha-ha-ha.
