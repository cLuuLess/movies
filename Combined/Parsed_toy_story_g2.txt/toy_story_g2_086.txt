ext. neighborhood street

buzz runs up close to the truck with woody still back a few
paces.

a strap

dangles off the back of the truck.  buzz makes a leap for it
and grabs hold.  he climbs up the strap and onto the bumper.

woody then lunges for the strap but it stays just out of reach.

                         buzz
            you can do it, woody.

woody gives a mighty leap and catches hold of the strap.

                         woody
            whew, i made it!

woody begins climbing up when suddenly buzz goes pale.
woody looks behind him to see...

scud

the dog leaps forward and bites down on one of woody's legs.

                         woody
                   (kicking scud with
                   other foot)
            aaaaaahh!!  get away, you stupid
            dog!  down!  down!

scud tugs on woody, pulling him down to the end of the strap.

                         buzz
            hold on, woody!

                         woody
            i can't do it!  take care of andy
            for me!

                         buzz
            no-o-o-o-o-o-o!!

buzz leaps off of the truck and onto scuds snout.  he grabs
scud's eyelids and snaps them hard.  scud yelps, letting go
of woody.  the dog bucks wildly with buzz hanging onto his
face.

                         woody
            buzz!

the moving truck continues down the street leaving buzz and
scud behind.

still hanging onto the strap, woody scrambles up onto the
bumper.  he unlocks the back door of the truck and tries to
lift up the heavy door.

suddenly, the family van and moving truck come to a stop at
a traffic light.

woody slams into the door, causing it to fly upward taking
woody with it.

hanging from the door, woody scans the inside of the truck
until he spots what he's looking for.

a pile of moving boxes

with the words "andy's toys" written on them in crayon.
