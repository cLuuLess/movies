int. andy's bedroom - that night

andy is being tucked into bed by his mother.  she hands him
his cowboy hat.

                         mrs. davis
            i looked everywhere, honey, but all
            i could find was your hat.

                         andy
                   (groggy)
            but what if we leave them behind?

                         mrs. davis
            oh, don't worry, honey, i'm sure
            we'll find woody and buzz before we
            leave tomorrow.

andy's eyes shut.  mom turns out the light and quietly exits
the room.

a moving box on the floor, with the words "andy's toys!"
scrawled on it, begins to shake from side to side.

                         rex (o.s.)
                   (muffled)
            aaaah!  i need air!

rex pops out of the top of the box, coughing a packing
styrofoam peanut out of his mouth.  potato head appears
beside him.

                         rex
                   (relieved)
            aa-a-a-a-ah!
                   (cough)

                         mr. potato head
            will you quit moving around?!

                         rex
            i'm sorry.  it's just that i get so
            nervous before i travel.

                         mr. potato head
            how did i get stuck with you as a
            moving buddy?

potato head drops back down into the box.

                         rex
                   (following potato head)
            everyone else was picked.

bo peep

peeks around the corner of one of the boxes and looks up at
andy fast asleep clutching his cowboy hat.

                         bo peep
            oh, woody, if only you could see
            how much andy misses you.
