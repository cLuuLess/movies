ext./int. front doorway - continuous

nobody's there.

hannah doesn't notice ducky stuck to the porch floor by his
plunger.

the frog

zooms down the stairs with scud barking right behind.  the
frog leaps off the last step, speeds through hannah's legs
and out the open front door.

hannah looks back inside at scud.  in that moment, ducky
catches the frog and is quickly reeled upwards back into the
roof.

scud bursts through hannah's legs, knocking her over, and
runs out onto the empty porch.

                         hannah
                   (annoyed)
            scud!!!

scud suddenly realizes he's been duped, but before he can
get back inside, hannah slams the front door shut.

                         hannah
            stupid dog.

scud smashes into the closed door and begins barking furiously.

as hannah storms off into another room she doesn't notice
woody and the mutants zipping off the stairs and round the
corner, heading straight into the kitchen.
