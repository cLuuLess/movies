ext. andy's bedroom window/sid's window

the rest of andy's toys gather around the window to see woody.

                         rex
            hey, look!

                         bo peep
            woody!

                         woody
            boy, am i glad to see you guys!

                         slinky
            i knew you'd come back, woody!

                         bo peep
            what are you doing over there?

                         woody
            it's a long story, bo.  i'll
            explain later.  here, catch this!

woody tosses one end of the christmas lights over.  slinky
catches them.

                         slinky
            i got it, woody!

                         rex
                   (overly excited)
            he got it, woody!

                         woody
            good going, slink!  now, just, just
            tie it on to something!

                         mr. potato head
            wait!  wait!  i got a better idea!
            how about we don't?!

potato head grabs the string of lights away from slinky.

                         slinky
            hey?!!

                         bo peep
            potato head!?

                         mr. potato head
            did you all take stupid pills this
            morning?!  have you forgotten what
            he did to buzz?  and now you want
            to let him back over here?

                         woody
            no, no, no!  you got it all wrong,
            potato head.  buzz is fine!  buzz
            is right here.  he's with me!

                         mr. potato head
            you are a liar!

                         woody
            no, i'm not!
                   (to buzz)
            buzz, come over here and you just
            tell the nice toys that you're not
            dead.

angle: buzz

he doesn't respond, preoccupied with peeling off the sticker
on his wrist communicator.  he crumples it up and tosses it
aside.

                         woody
                   (to andy's toys)
            just a sec.
