int. backpack - continuous

buzz, woody and a squeeze toy alien are scrunched up in the
backpack.

                         buzz
            sheriff!  i can see your dwelling
            from here!  you're almost home.

                         alien
            nirvana is coming!  the mystic
            portal awaits!

                         woody
                   (to alien)
            will you be quiet?!!
                   (to both)
            you guys don't get it, do you?
            once we go into sid's house, we
            won't be coming out.

angle: toys' pov from out backpack

the front door opens to reveal scud.  the dog lunges
straight for the backpack, barking.

                         sid
            whoa, scud!  hey, boy.  sit!  good
            boy!

the dog begrudgingly obeys.

                         sid
            hey, i got somethin' for ya, boy.

sid's hand reaches into the backpack.

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            freeze!!!

the toys go still.  sid's hand grabs the alien out of the
backpack.  the alien is then placed sideways along scud's
snout.

                         sid
            ready, set, now.

in one quick motion, scud flips the alien up, catches it in
his mouth, and rabidly shakes it back and forth.

buzz and woody react in horror.

                         sid
            hannah!  hey, hannah!!!

woody and buzz glance up to see hannah, sid's frail little
sister, carrying her janie doll.

                         hannah
            what?

                         sid
            did i get my package in the mail?

                         hannah
            i dunno.

                         sid
            whaddaya mean, you don't know?

                         hannah
                   (insistent)
            i don't know!

                         sid
                   (mock concern)
            oh no, hannah!

                         hannah
            what?

                         sid
            look!  janie!

he grabs the doll.

                         hannah
            hey!!

                         sid
            she's sick!

                         hannah
                   (panic rising)
            no she's not --

                         sid
            i'll have to perform one of
            my...operations!

                         hannah
            no-o-o... don't touch her!  no!

sid bolts upstairs with hannah in pursuit.

                         woody
            not sid's room...not there...
