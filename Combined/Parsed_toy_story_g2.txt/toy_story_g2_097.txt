before anyone can notice, woody and buzz land in an open box
in the back seat right next to andy.

andy turns to discover the limp buzz and woody lying in the
box.

                         andy
            hey!  wow!

                         mrs. davis
            what?  what is it?

                         andy
                   (picking up the toys)
            woody!  buzz!

                         mrs. davis
            oh, great, you found them.  where
            were they?

                         andy
            here!  in the car!

                         mrs. davis
            see?  now, what did i tell you?
