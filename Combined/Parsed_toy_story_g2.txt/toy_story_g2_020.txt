int. andy's bedroom - continuous

                         sargent (o.s.)
                   (from monitor)
            ...it's...it's a --

the sound of children cheering emits from the monitor,
cutting off the sargent.

                         rex
            it's a what?! what is it?!!!

rex grabs a leg of the nightstand and shakes it, making the
monitor drop to the floor.  the impact causes the batteries
to roll out.

                         rex
            oh, no!

                         mr. potato head
            oh, ya big lizard!  now we'll never
            know what it is!

                         hamm
                   (sarcastic)
            way to go, rex.

everyone rushes to the fallen monitor.  potato head tries to
correctly insert the batteries.

                         woody
            no, no!  turn 'em around, turn 'em
            around!

                         hamm
            eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!

                         woody
            plus is positive, minus is negative!
            oh, let me!

woody jumps down off the bed and shoves both hamm and potato
head aside.
