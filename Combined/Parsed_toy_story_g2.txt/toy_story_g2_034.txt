int. pizza planet delivery truck - continuous

woody peeks through the dividing window into the cab.

buzz is hidden from the pizza driver's view by a stack of
pizzas in their insulated covers.  buzz prudently fastens
his safety belt.

                         woody
            it'll be safer in the cockpit than
            the cargo bay.  what an idiot!

the driver shifts into gear and hits the gas, propelling
woody to the back of the truck.

the pizza deliverer drives like a maniac, taking sharp turns
and hills at high speeds.  woody is helplessly thrown around
the truck.  with every blow, woody yelps in pain.

the truck climbs a steep hill.  woody looks up just in time
to see...

a large tool box

barreling towards him.

bam!!!

                                            cut to:

a star-filled black night sky

we move down to reveal...
