int. sid's room - continuous

an inanimate woody flies across the room, landing hard on
the floor.

sid crosses to the window.

                         sid
                   (as interrogator)
            i can see your will is strong.

sid opens the window shade.  bright sunlight shines down
onto woody.

                         sid
                   (continued)
            well, we have ways of making you talk.

sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and
focuses the beam on woody's forehead.

                         sid
                   (as interrogator)
            where are your rebel friends now?
            heh, heh.

a bright white hot dot forms on woody's forehead and begins
to smolder.

                         sid's mom (o.s.)
            sid!!  your pop-tarts are ready!

sid pulls the magnifying glass away.

                         sid
            alright!!

sid runs out of the room.  as soon as he's gone, woody jumps
up screaming, his forehead burning.

he runs to a bowl of half-eaten cereal (with milk) on the
floor, and dunks his head in.

buzz runs over to woody, pausing to remove two suction cup
darts from his person before pulling woody out of the bowl.
two colorful froot-loops stick to each of woody's eyes like
glasses.

                         buzz
            are you alright?
                   (whacking him on the back)
            i'm proud of you, sheriff.  a
            lesser man would have talked under
            such torture.

woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal
spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.

                         woody
            i sure hope this isn't permanent.

                         buzz
                   (checking his wrist communicator)
            still no word from star command.
            we're not that far from the
            spaceport --

woody's eyes light up.

angle: spoon

sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection.  it's open.

                         woody
            the door!  it's open!  we're free!!

woody runs for the door.  buzz follows.

                         buzz
            woody, we don't know what's out there!

                         woody
            i'll tell you what's -- aaaah!

the mutant toys

suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway.  woody
hides behind buzz.

                         woody
            they're gonna eat us, buzz!!  do
            something!  quick!

                         buzz
            shield your eyes!

buzz fires his laser at them.  the little red beam just
flickers against babyface's head.  the mutant toys look
confusedly at each other.

                         buzz
            it's not working.  i recharged it
            before i left.  it should be good
            for hours --

                         woody
            oh, you idiot!  you're a toy!  use
            your karate chop action!

grabbing buzz like a hostage, woody fends off the mutant
toys by pushing a large button on buzz's back, making buzz's
arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.

                         woody
                   (to mutants)
            get away!  hoo-cha!  hoo-cha!

                         buzz
            hey!!  hey!  how are you doing that?
            stop that!

                         woody
            back!  back, you savages!  back!

woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway,
continually chopping buzz's arm.

                         buzz
            woody, stop it!!

                         woody
            sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!

woody drops buzz and runs out the door.
