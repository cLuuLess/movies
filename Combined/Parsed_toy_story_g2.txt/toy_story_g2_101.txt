int. andy's new bedroom

the receiving end of the monitor is atop andy's night stand.
it crackles with static.

                         sargent (o.s.)
                   (over the monitor)
            frankincense, this is myrrh.  come
            in, frankincense.

buzz sits on the edge of andy's bed while hamm rests on the
nightstand alongside the monitor.  they listen intently.

                         hamm
                   (to the room)
            hey, heads up everybody!  it's
            showtime.

woody and the rest of the toys are mingling together like a
typical office christmas party.

                         rex
            oh!  it's time!

the toys all stop and run towards the monitor.

woody is about to follow when a crook pulls him backwards to
reveal...

bo peep

                         woody
            whoooooah!  oh!  bo!
                   (rubbing his neck)
            there's gotta be a less painful way
            to get my attention.

                         bo peep
            merry christmas, sheriff.

she smiles and points her crook upwards to her sheep perched
on a shelf dangling mistletoe.

                         woody
            say, isn't that mistletoe?

                         bo peep
            mm-hmmmmm.

bo drops her crook, dips woody and kisses him.

the rest of the toys have congregated below the monitor
restless with "excitement" not fear.

                         rex
                   (to slinky)
            maybe andy'll get another dinosaur,
            like a leaf-eater.  that way, i
            could play the, uh, dominant
            predator.  ha ha ha!

slinky laughs with rex.

                         buzz
            quiet everyone, quiet!

                         sargent (o.s.)
                   (over monitor)
            molly's first present i-i-is...mrs.
            potato head.  repeat.  a mrs.
            potato head.

                         hamm
            way to go, idaho!

all the toys congratulate potato head.

                         mr. potato head
            gee, i better shave.

potato head whips off his moustache piece.

woody climbs up onto the bed and joins buzz.  lipstick now
covers woody's face.

                         sargent (o.s.)
                   (over monitor)
            come in, frankincense.  andy is now
            opening his first present --
                   (static)


buzz bangs on the side of the monitor.  nothing.

                         woody
            buzz.  buzz lightyear.  you are not
            worried, are you?

                         sargent (o.s.)
                   (over monitor)
            i can't quite make out --
                   (static)

                         buzz
                   (defensively)
            me?  no, no, no, no...
                   (beat)
            are you?

                         woody
                   (laughing)
            now buzz, what could andy possibly
            get that is worse than you?!

we truck out through the window to the ext. as we hear...

                         andy (o.s.)
            oh, what is it?  what is it?

sfx: barking

                         andy (o.s.)
            wow!  a puppy!

we zoom back through the window to a close up of buzz and
woody.

they look at one another with a half-smile, half-grimace and
laugh weakly.
