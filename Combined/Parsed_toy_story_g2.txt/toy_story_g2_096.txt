ext. sky - buzz and woody

the rocket hurtles upward higher and higher.

                         woody
            ahhh!! this is the part where we
            blow up!

                         buzz
            not today!

buzz confidently presses the button on his chest.

wings

jut out of buzz, severing the tape that holds him to rocket.
the toys separate from the rocket just before it blows up.

the toys plummet.

                         woody
                   (covering his eyes)
            ah-h-h-h-h!!

just then buzz banks under some power lines and soars upward
again.  woody takes a peek.

they're flying.

                         woody
            hey, buzz!!  you're flying!!

                         buzz
            this isn't flying.  this is
            falling -- with style!

                         woody
            ha ha!!  to infinity and beyond!!

they soar gracefully towards the moving truck, but then pass
over it.

                         woody
            uh, buzz?!  we missed the truck!

                         buzz
            we're not aiming for the truck!

angle: family van

buzz and woody fly right over the van's sun roof and then
drop into the car.
