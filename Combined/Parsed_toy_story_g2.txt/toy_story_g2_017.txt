int. downstairs - house plant

the platoon is preparing to exit the plant when...

                         mrs. davis (o.s.)
            wait a minute.  oooh, what do we
            have here?!

the sargent lifts his binoculars back to his eyes.

mrs. davis can be seen opening the closet and pulling out
another large present.

                         sargent
                   (indicating the baby monitor)
            wait -- turn that thing back on!
