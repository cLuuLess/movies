the toys are all congratulating one another.

            nice work, fellahs.  good job.
            comin' out of the ground -- what a
            touch!  that was a stroke of genius.

                         buzz
            woody!

woody turns around and looks at buzz, who's still affixed to
sid's launchpad.  buzz extends his hand to woody.

                         buzz
            thanks.

they shake.

            everybody say, "bye, house."

                         andy (o.s.)
                   (depressed)
            bye, house.

buzz and woody look in the direction of andy's house.

angle: andy's driveway - the family van

through the fence, andy and his family can be seen getting
into the van.

                         buzz
            woody!  the van!

woody quickly hoists buzz off the pole he was tied to.

                         woody
                   (to mutant toys)
            we gotta run!  thanks, guys.

with the rocket still taped to buzz, the two toys sprint
towards the fence.

                         woody
            quick!

woody easily slips through the slats in the fence, but
buzz's rocket causes him to become stuck.
