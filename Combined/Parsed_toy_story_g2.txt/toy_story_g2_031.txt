int. van - continuous

andy sits in the rear seat with woody lying next to him.

                         andy
            can i help pump the gas?

                         mrs. davis
            sure!  i'll even let you drive.

both mrs. davis and andy exit the van while baby molly
sleeps up front in her car seat.

                         andy (o.s.)
            yeah?!

                         mrs. davis (o.s.)
            yeah -- when you're sixteen.

                         andy (o.s.)
                   (sarcastic)
            yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, mom.

with mom and andy out of range, woody comes to life.  he
stares out the sun roof, still reeling from everything.

                         woody
            oh, great.  how am i gonna convince
            those guys it was an accident?

suddenly, buzz appears over the edge of the sun roof.

                         woody
            buzz!

buzz jumps down on the back seat to face woody.  he is furious.

                         woody
            buzz!  you're alive!  this is great!
            oh, i'm saved!  i'm saved!  andy'll
            find you here, he'll take us back
            to the room, and then you can tell
            everyone that this was all just a
            big mistake.  huh?

no response from buzz.  just an angry stare.

                         woody
                   (weakly)
            right?  buddy?

                         buzz
            i just want you to know that even
            though you tried to terminate me,
            revenge is not an idea we promote
            on my planet.

                         woody
            oh.  oh, that's good.

                         buzz
                   (getting in woody's face)
            but we're not on my planet, are we?

                         woody
            no.

buzz lunges for woody.  the two toys fly off the seat and
out the open side door of the van.
