ext. sid's window/andy's window

woody reappears at the edge of sid's window.  he pretends to
notice something out of the other toy's view.

                         woody
                   (forced casualness)
            oh, hi buzz!  why don't you say
            "hello" to the guys over there?

buzz's severed arm

suddenly appears with woody holding the end just out of
sight.  woody throws his voice, pretending to be buzz.

                         woody (as buzz)
            hi ya, fellas.  to infinity and
            beyond!

                         rex
            hey look!  it's buzz!

                         woody
                   (shaking the arm's hand)
            yeah, hey buzz.  let's show the
            guys our new secret best-friends
            hand shake.  gimme five, man!

                         hamm
            something's screwy here.

                         woody
            so, you see?  we're friends now,
            guys.  aren't we, buzz?
                   (as buzz)
            you bet.  gimme a hug.

woody makes buzz's arm grab his neck and pull him forward.

                         woody
                   (continued; as himself)
            ha, ha, oh, i love you, too.

                         slinky
            see?  it is buzz.  now give back
            the lights, potato head.

                         mr. potato head
            wait just a minute.  what are you
            trying to pull?!

                         woody
            nothing.

woody innocently shrugs and throws both his hands up...

...exposing the severed arm.

the toys all scream in horror.  rex clasps his hands to his
mouth and turns away to barf.

realizing his mistake, woody tries to hide the arm, but it's
too late.

                         hamm
            oh, that is disgusting.

                         mr. potato head
            murderer!

                         woody
            no!  no, no, no, no!

                         mr. potato head
            you murdering dog!

                         woody
            no, it's not what you think, i swear!

                         mr. potato head
            save it for the jury.  i hope sid
            pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!

potato head drops the lights.

                         woody
            no!  no!  don't leave!  don't leave!
            you've gotta help us, please!  you
            don't know what it's like over here!

                         mr. potato head
                   (to the other toys)
            come on.  let's get out of here.

                         hamm
            go back to your lives, citizens.
            show's over.

all the toys leave the window except slinky.

                         woody
            come back!  slink!  slink, please!
            please!  listen to me!

unable to look woody in the eye, slinky closes the blinds.

                         woody
                   (continued)
            no!  no!  come back!  sli-i-i-inkyyy!!

sfx: thunder

as storm clouds roll over sid's house, woody slumps over the
window sill in defeat.
