int. upstairs hallway - continuous

buzz walks dejectedly out of the den and down the hallway.

as he passes the top of the stairwell he pauses to look up
through the railing at...

a small window

it is open, revealing the blue sky beyond.  a bird flies past.

the taunting voice of woody echoes in his head.

                         woody (v.o.)
            you are a toy!  you can't fly!

buzz bows his head, defeated.

beat

slowly buzz raises his head, determination in his eyes.  he
slams the offending wrist communicator shut, as if to deny
its message of "made in taiwan."

buzz climbs up the railing to the banister.  he pops open
his wings, and aims himself towards the window above.

                         buzz
            to infinity and beyond!

buzz leaps off the banister...

and falls.

in slow motion buzz watches his square of blue sky pull
farther away from him as he plummets to the floor below.
