int. hannah's bedroom/upstairs hallway - continuous

hannah is pretending to have a tea party.  her guests are
dolls, headless dolls, that is except for...

buzz

he is seated at the miniature table, dressed up in a frilly
apron and fashionable party hat.

                         hannah
                   (continued)
            would you like some tea, mrs. nesbit?

                         woody
                   (under his breath)
            buzz!

hannah has placed a tiny teapot in buzz's severed arm and
pours imaginary tea with it.

                         hannah
            it's so nice you could join us on
            such late notice.

woody steps back into the hallway.

                         woody
            oh, no!

                         hannah
            what a lovely hat, mrs. nesbit.  it
            goes quite well with your head.

woody thinks for a moment, then takes a few steps further
down the hall.  he clears his throat.

                         woody
                   (high voice)
            hannah!  oh, hannah!

hannah stops pouring tea and looks up.

                         hannah
                   (yelling out her room)
            mom?
                   (to the dolls)
            please excuse me, ladies.  i'll be
            right back.

as soon as hannah exits the room buzz keels over face-down
onto the table.

hannah passes woody, hidden in the christmas lights, and
walks downstairs.

                         hannah
            what is it, mom?  mom, where are you?

woody bolts into hannah's room.

                         woody
            buzz!  hey, buzz!  are you okay?

buzz lifts his head up and wails in drunken despair.

                         buzz
            gone!  it's all go-o-one!  all of
            it's gone.  bye-bye!  whoo-hoo!
            see ya!

woody picks up buzz's severed arm.

                         woody
            what happened to you?

                         buzz
            one minute you're defending the
            whole galaxy...
                   (pointing at other dolls)
            ...and suddenly you find yourself
            suckin' down darjeeling with marie
            antoinette and her little sisters.

the headless dolls turn and wave.

woody removes the teapot from the severed arm and sets it on
the table.

                         woody
            i think you've had enough tea for
            today.
                   (helping buzz up)
            let's get you out of here, buzz.

                         buzz
                   (grabbing woody)
            don't you get it?!  you see the hat?
            i am mrs. nesbit!!
                   (hysterical laughter)


                         woody
            snap out of it, buzz!

woody presses buzz's helmet open, slaps him across the face
with his own detached arm, and then politely closes the helmet.

buzz sobers up and calmly takes his severed arm from woody.
buzz walks out of the room while woody follows.

                         buzz
                   (sober)
            i'm sorry.  you're right.
