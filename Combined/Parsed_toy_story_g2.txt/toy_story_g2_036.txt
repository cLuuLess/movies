angle: the front entrance

two imposing animatronic robots guard the doorway.  as
customers approach the front, the guards part their crossed
"pizza spears," allowing the patrons to enter.

                         buzz
            there you are.  now the entrance is
            heavily guarded.  we need a way to

woody rises from the trash with a "mega-gulp" cup on his head.
