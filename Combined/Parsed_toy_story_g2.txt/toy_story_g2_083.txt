int. sid's entryway

hannah has just come downstairs carrying a new doll when sid
rushes up to her.

                         sid
            the toys!  the toys are alive!

sid eyes hannah's doll and pats it gently on the head.

                         sid
                   (continued)
            n-n-nice dolly...

hannah, sensing sid's fear, suddenly thrusts the doll in
sid's face.  he screams and runs upstairs.  hannah chases
after him, taunting.

                         hamm
            what's wrong, sid?!  don't you want
            to play with sally?!
