ext. andy's house - continuous

andy exits the house dragging woody as he heads toward the
family van in the driveway.

                         andy
            i couldn't find my buzz.  i know i
            left him right there.

                         mrs. davis
            honey, i'm sure he's around.
            you'll find him.

a bush

next to the van begins to rustle.  hands part the foliage,
revealing buzz.  he eyes woody going into the van and does a
slow burn.

the van engine starts up.  buzz races out of the bush, and
with a mighty leap, grabs the rear fender of the van as it
pulls out of the driveway.

angle: side of andy's house

a chain of monkeys falls into view, dangling a considerable
distance above the ground.
