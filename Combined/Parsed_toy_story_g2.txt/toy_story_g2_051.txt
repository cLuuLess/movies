int. sid's dad's den - continuous

mr. phillips is asleep on a la-z-boy recliner in front of
the t.v.

scud backs out and heads down the stairs.

buzz turns to exit the room when he hears...

                         space commander (o.s.; on tv)
            calling buzz lightyear!!  come in

            command.  buzz lightyear!  do you
            read me?!

                         buzz
            star command!

buzz opens up his wrist communicator and is just about to
speak into it when he is interrupted.

                         kid #1 (o.s.)
            buzz lightyear responding!  read
            you loud and clear!

buzz turns around to see...

a television set

buzz's space ranger logo is on the screen over a field of
stars.  the image quickly changes to two young boys playing
in their backyard with a buzz lightyear doll.

                         space commander
            buzz lightyear, planet earth needs
            your help!

                         male chorus (v.o.)
            buzz lightyear!!!

buzz reacts with confusion at what he is watching.  he walks
slowly towards the television set.

                         tv announcer (v.o.)
            the world's greatest superhero!
            now the world's greatest toy!

with every feature demonstrated on the tv, buzz compares the
same feature on himself.

                         tv announcer (v.o.)
            pulsating laserlight!

buzz presses the same button on his uniform.

                         buzz (sampled voice)
            it's a secret mission in uncharted
            space!

                         tv announcer (v.o.)

                         tv buzz
            to infinity and beyond!

on the tv screen, the buzz lightyear action figure appears
to be launched through the air.  the words:  not a flying
toy flash across the bottom of the screen.

                         tv announcer (v.o.)
                   (non-excited lawyer voice)
            not a flying toy.

buzz slowly shakes his head in wide-eyed disbelief.

                         tv announcer (v.o.)
            get your buzz lightyear action
            figure and save a galaxy near you!

                         male chorus (v.o.)
            buzz lightyear!!!

the image on the screen changes to a shot of hundreds of
buzzes in their boxes lining either side of a store aisle.

                         local announcer (v.o.)
            available at all al's toy barn
            outlets in the tri-county area.

buzz is stricken.  he looks down at his wrist communicator
and opens it.

in taiwan."

song: "i will go sailing no more" begins
