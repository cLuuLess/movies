int. pizza planet - front entrance - continuous

woody and buzz just make it inside but then freeze
immediately as a group of kids run past, forcing the toys to
pose as discarded trash.

once the coast is clear, woody and buzz resume walking.
buzz bumps into woody.

                         woody
                   (using straw as periscope)
            ow!  watch where you're going!

                         buzz
                   (mouthing with burger box)
            sorry.

they sneak in between two long rows of video games and throw
off their disguises.  they then take a good look at...

the arcade

the space-themed arena is filled with hordes of children
playing video games.  a sea of hi-tech sounds and lights
overwhelm the place.

buzz is beaming with hope.

                         buzz
            what a space port.  good work, woody.

woody is busy looking at all the children in the arcade, but
none of the kids look familiar to him.  just then he hears...

                         andy (o.s.)
            mom, can i play black hole?
            please, please, please?!

woody turns around and through the video games he spots...

andy

standing with mom and molly in her stroller.

                         woody
                   (to himself)
            andy!

                         mrs. davis
            what's black hole?

                         andy
            oh, it's so cool...

the family begins to walk away.

                         buzz
            now we need to find a ship that's
            headed for sector 12 --

buzz is about to head off in the opposite direction when
woody grabs him and quickly pulls him down the video corridor.

                         woody
            wait a minute!  no buzz!  this way!
            there's a special ship.  i just saw
            it!

                         buzz
            you mean it has hyperdrive?

                         woody
            hyper-active hyperdrive, and
            astro...uh, turf.

the toys manage to get ahead of andy.  woody peeks around
the corner of one of the video games and waits for mom and
andy to approach.

                         woody
                   (tracking andy and family)
            c'mon, c'mon, that's it...

                         buzz
            where is it?  i don't see the --

buzz stops short at the sight of...

a crane game

it is modeled to look like a spaceship ready to launch.

                         buzz
                   (continued)
            spaceship.

                         woody
            alright buzz, get ready...

buzz heads for the crane game, but woody does not notice,
his eyes locked on the approaching stroller.

                         woody
            okay, buzz, when i say "go," we're
            gonna jump in the basket --

woody turns and realizes buzz is gone.  he looks across the
way just in time to see buzz leap into the crane game
through the "prize" slot.

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            buzz!

woody turns back in the direction of the stroller.

it has already gone past.

                         woody
            dooh!  no!  this cannot be
            happening to me!!

woody runs towards the crane game, but is forced to hold
back for a moment as some screaming children pass by.
