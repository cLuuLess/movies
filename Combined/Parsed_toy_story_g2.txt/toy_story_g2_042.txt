ext. sid's house - later that night

from out of the darkness appears sid on his skateboard.  he
is humming to rock music from his walkman while carrying his
backpack in his hand.

sid leaps off the skateboard and walks up the front path
towards the front door.

through the open zipper, buzz peeks out of the backpack to
see sid's house.  he recognizes andy's house next door.
