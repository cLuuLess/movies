ext. sid's backyard - continuous

...and catapult into the bushes.

the toys peek out from the bush to see buzz strapped to the
launchpad.  sid is still in the toolshed.

                         sid (o.s.; as astronaut)
            uh, mission control...is the
            launchpad construction complete? --
                   (simulated static)
            uh, roger, rocket is now secured to
            guide wire.  we are currently
            obtaining the...ignition sticks.
            countdown will commence momentarily.
            stand by --
                   (simulated static)


ducky, legs, and the frog shoot out into the yard from a
drain pipe.  they exchange a thumbs-up with woody.

                         woody
                   (to toys in the bush)
            let's go!

the mutants disperse to their designated places in the yard.

                         sid (o.s.)
            hey, mom?!  where are the matches?
            oh, oh, wait, here they are.
            nevermind...

woody runs towards buzz, who spots woody approaching.

                         buzz
                   (loud whisper)
            woody?!  great!  help me out of
            this thing!

woody stops a few feet away from buzz.

                         woody
            shhhhhhh!

                         buzz
            what?!

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            it's ok.  everything's under control.

woody deliberately falls down limp on the grass.

                         buzz
            woody?!  what are you doing?!

sid emerges from the tool shed.  buzz freezes.

                         sid (as astronaut)
            houston, all systems are go.
            requesting permission to launch --
                   (spotting woody)
            hey!  how'd you get out here?

sid picks up woody, examines him for a beat and then smiles.

                         sid
            oh, well, you and i can have a
            cookout later.  ha-ha-ha...

he sticks a match prominently in woody's holster and tosses
him onto the grill of an open barbecue.

                         sid (as astronaut)
            houston, do we have permission to
            launch? --
                   (simulated static)
            uh, roger, permission granted.  you
            are confirmed at t minus 10 seconds...

during sid's countdown, all the mutants scurry into their
final positions.

sid lights a match.

                         sid
                   (continued)
            ...and counting.  ten!  nine!
            eight!  seven!  six!  five!  four!
            three!  two!... one!...

sid grins menacingly as the match moves towards the fuse.

                         woody (voice box)
            reach for the sky!!

                         sid
            huh?

sid pulls back from lighting the fuse.  he turns to look at
woody still lying lifelessly atop the barbecue except for
the sound emitting from his voice box.

                         woody (voice box)
            this town ain't big enough for the
            two of us!

                         sid
            what?!

sid walks over to woody and picks him up.

                         woody (voice box)
            somebody's poisoned the water hole...

                         sid
            it's busted.

he raises woody up, about to throw him away --

                         woody (voice box)
            who are you callin' busted, buster?!

sid stops short and looks at woody again.

                         woody (voice box)
                   (continued)
            that's right.  i'm talking to you,
            sid phillips.  we don't like being
            blown up, sid, or smashed, or
            ripped apart...

while woody's voice box talks, sid checks the pullstring.

it isn't moving.  sid gulps.

                         sid
            w-w-w-we?

                         woody (voice box)
            that's right.
                   (beat)
            your toys.

the remains of broken toys in the yard, led by the bedroom
mutants, begin rising from the ground in "night of the
living dead" fashion.
the toys march forward, forming a circle around sid.  sid is
too frightened to scream or move.

                         woody (voice box)
            from now on, you must take good
            care of your toys.  because if you
            don't, we'll find out, sid.  we
            toys can see...

woody's inanimate head rotates 360 degrees.

                         woody (voice box)
                   (continued)
            ...everything.

for a split second woody's face comes to life.

                         woody
                   (regular voice)
            so play nice.

sid drops woody and bolts inside the house.

                         sid
            aaaaaaagggggghhhhhh!!!!!

woody and all the toys cheer victoriously.
