ext. andy's bedroom window - continuous

the rest of andy's toys have regrouped at the window,
supervising the lowering of the "monkey chain."

            it's too short!  we need more monkeys!

                         rex
                   (holding up an empty barrel)
            there aren't any more!  that's the
            whole barrel.

rex throws the barrel down and runs back to the ledge.

                         rex
                   (yelling out window)
            buzz!  the monkeys aren't working!
            we're formulating another plan!
            stay calm!
                   (beat)
            oh, where could he be?
