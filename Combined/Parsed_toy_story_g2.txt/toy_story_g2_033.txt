ext. gas station - a few minutes later

the delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.

                         pizza deliverer (o.s.)
            c'mon, man, hurry up.  um, like the
            pizza's are getting cold here.

woody and buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the
safety of a nearby oilcan display.

                         buzz
            now you're sure this spacefreighter
            will return to its port of origin
            once it jettisons its food supply?

                         woody
            uh-huh.  and when we get there,
            we'll be able to find a way to
            transport you...home.

                         buzz
            well, then let's climb abroad.

buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the
pizza truck.  woody chases after him.

                         woody
            no, no, no, wait, buzz, buzz, let's
            get in the back.  no one will see
            us there.

                         buzz
            negative.  there are no restraining
            harnesses in the cargo area.  we'll
            be much safer in the cockpit.

in a flash, buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear
view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            yeah, but, buzz!  buzz!

                         pizza deliverer (o.s.)
            ok, so that's two lefts, and then a
            right, huh?

                         attendant (o.s.)
            yeah.

                         pizza deliverer (o.s.)
            okay, thanks for the directions.

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            buzz!

sfx: engine starting

woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the
bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside.

woody lets out a yell, as the back hatch slams back down on
his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.
