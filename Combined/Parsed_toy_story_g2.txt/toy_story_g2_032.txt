ext. gas station - continuous

woody and buzz hit the ground and roll under the van, locked
in mortal combat.

                         woody
            ok!  come on!  you want a piece of
            me?!

buzz lands a punch that sends woody's head spinning around.

woody lunges with all his might.  he smacks buzz in the
face, making it squeak with every blow.

buzz closes his helmet on woody's hand.

                         woody
            owwwww!!!

woody pounds on buzz's chest with his free hand, activating
buzz's sampled voice buttons.

sfx: car door slam

the toys stop fighting.  before they can react...

                         mrs. davis (o.s.)
            next stop...

                         andy (o.s.)
            pizza planet!  yeah!!!

the van drives off.

                         woody
                   (gasp)
            andy?!

woody starts to run in the direction of the van but it
drives out of sight, leaving buzz and woody stranded.

                         woody
            doesn't he realize that i'm not
            there?
                   (beat)
            i'm lost!  oh, i'm a lost toy!

meanwhile, buzz checks the surroundings.  he flips open his
wrist communicator.

                         buzz
            buzz lightyear mission log.  the
            local sheriff and i seem to be at a
            huge refueling station of some
            sort --

woody whips around, his expression changing from panic to
seething anger.  he charges at buzz.

                         woody
            you!

sfx: loud truck horn

just then the toys are bathed in the headlight beams of a
behemoth tanker truck pulling into the station.

buzz dives off to the side while woody collapses right where
he stands on the pavement.  the truck roars over him.

a gigantic tire

stops just millimeters from woody's nose.

petrified, woody inches away from the tire, moving back
under the truck until he bumps into buzz.

                         buzz
                   (into wrist communicator)
            according to my nava-computer, the --

                         woody
                   (whispering)
            shut up!  just shut up, you idiot!!

                         buzz
            sheriff, this is no time to panic.

                         woody
            this is the perfect time to panic!
            i'm lost, andy is gone, they're
            going to move from their house in
            two days and it's all your fault!!

                         buzz
            my fault?!  if you hadn't pushed me
            out of the window in the first
            place --

                         woody
            oh, yeah?  well, if you hadn't
            shown up in your stupid little
            cardboard spaceship and taken away
            everything that was important to
            me --

                         buzz
            don't talk to me about importance.
            because of you the security of this
            entire universe is in jeopardy.

                         woody
                   (incredulous)
            what?!!  what are you talking about?!

buzz walk to the edge of the truck tire and points up to the
stars.

                         buzz
            right now, poised at the edge of
            the galaxy, emperor zurg has been
            secretly building a weapon with the
            destructive capacity to annihilate
            an entire planet.  i alone have
            information that reveals this
            weapon's only weakness.
                   (pointing at woody)
            and you, my friend, are responsible
            for delaying my rendez-vous with
            star command.

woody explodes.

                         woody
            you are a toy!!!  you aren't the
            real buzz lightyear, you're an
            action figure!!  you are a child's
            plaything!!!

beat.

                         buzz
            you are a sad strange little man
            and you have my pity.  farewell.

buzz walks off.

                         woody
            oh, yeah?  well, good riddance, ya
            looney!

woody walks away in the opposite direction.

                         woody
                   (to himself)
            rendez-vous with star command.

sfx: screeching tires followed by gas station bell

                         pizza deliverer (o.s.)
            hey, gas dude!

                         attendant (o.s.)
            you talkin' to me?

                         pizza deliverer (o.s.)
            yeah, man, can you help me?  do you
            know where cutting blvd. is?

                         attendant (o.s.)
            just a moment...

woody looks in the direction of the bell.  his face lights
up at the sight of...

a pizza planet delivery truck.

                         woody
                   (to himself)
            pizza planet...andy!

woody takes a step forward and then stops.

                         woody
            oh, no!  i can't show my face in
            that room without buzz.

woody runs back under the tanker truck.  buzz is at the far
end of the truck, walking away from woody.

                         woody
            buzz!  buzz, come back!

                         buzz
                   (continuing to walk away)
            go away.

woody looks back at the delivery truck in desperation and
then eyes...

angle: delivery truck roof sign

atop the truck is a rocket with the pizza planet logo.

                         woody
            no, buzz, you've gotta come back.
            i found a spaceship!

buzz stops walking away and looks back at woody.

                         woody
            it's a spaceship, buzz!
