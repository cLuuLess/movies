ext. street/back of moving truck

the rc car begins to gain on the truck.

                         woody
            we're almost there.

                         bo peep
            rocky!  the ramp!

rocky, the wrestler doll, rushes over to a lever on the side
of the back.  the sign above it reads "ramp: up/down."
rocky pushes down hard on the lever.  the ramp begins to lower.

woody & buzz look up to see the ramp about to come down
right on top of them.

                         buzz
            look out!!

the rc car pulls back just before the heavy ramp slams into
the road.  sparks fly everywhere from the metal scraping the
pavement.

                         slinky
                   (to other toys)
            quick!  hold on to my tail!

potato head and rex grabs on to slinky's tail allowing
slinky's front end to jump off the truck and onto the ramp.

slinky leans forward with his paw outstretched to woody.
woody hands the remote to buzz and leans forward to grab
slinky's hand.

angle: woody & slinky's hands

they grab hold of one another.

                         mr. potato head
            that a boy, slink!!

all of a sudden, the rc car begins to slow down pulling
slinky's front end off the ramp.

                         slinky
            woody!!

his slinky middle begins to stretch and stretch...

                         slinky
            woody!  speed up!

                         woody
                   (to buzz)
            speed up!

                         buzz
            the batteries!  they're running out!

rc's headlight eyes sag.  the car slows even more.

as slinky continues stretching.  the rc car begins to weave
side-to-side like a water skier.

                         slinky
            whoa!  whoa!  whoa!
