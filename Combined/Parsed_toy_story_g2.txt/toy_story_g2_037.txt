ext. pizza planet - front entrance

in the f.g. sits a trashcan with fast food containers
littered around it.  more customers approach the "guarded"
entrance.

                         robot guards
            you are clear to enter.  welcome to
            pizza planet.

the front doors automatically swing open as the people pass
through.  suddenly two pieces of trash -- a burger container
and "mega-gulp" cup stand up.

                         buzz
                   (in burger container)
            now!

the two disguised toys make a dash through the closing doors.

                         buzz
                   (in container)
            quickly, sheriff!  the airlock is
            closing.
