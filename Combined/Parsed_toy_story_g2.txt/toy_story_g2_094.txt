ext. street/back of moving truck

with slinky's mid-section stretched to the limit, he begins
to lose his grip on woody.

                         slinky
            i can't hold on much longer!

                         woody
            slink!  hang on!

slinky's hand slips, sending his front shooting back into
the moving truck and knocking over all the toys.

the rc car sputters to a stop.

woody and buzz watch in vain as the family van and moving
truck disappear.

buzz tosses the remote to the ground in frustration.

                         woody
                   (sarcastic)
            great!

beat

                         buzz
            woody!  the rocket!

                         woody
            the match!

woody pulls out the match from his holster that sid had put
there earlier.

                         woody
                   (continued)
            yes!  thank you, sid!

woody runs around behind buzz, strikes the match against
rc's back tire, and is about to light the fuse when...

a car

whizzes right over them, blowing out the match.

woody clenches the burnt match in his hands and falls
prostrate to the ground.

                         woody
            no-o-o!  no-no-no-no!  no-o-o!

unable to watch a cowboy cry, buzz bows his head, causing
his helmet to block the sun from woody.

as buzz's shadow passes over him, woody stops whimpering and
looks at his hand.

a white hot dot

like the one generated from sid's magnifying glass, appears
on the back of woody's hand.

woody leaps up, grabs buzz's helmet and aligns it so the
white dot hits the tip of the fuse.

                         buzz
            woody?!  what are you doing?

                         woody
            hold still, buzz!

the fuse lights.

                         woody
            ha-ha!!

                         buzz
            you did it!  next stop.  andy.

woody jumps back onto the car then suddenly stops smiling.

                         woody
            wait a minute...i just lit a rocket.
            rockets explo --

sfx: rocket explosion

the rc car rockets forward.  speeding along the dividing
line in the road, it easily passes car after car until the
moving truck can be seen on the horizon.
