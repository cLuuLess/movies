int. downstairs living room

-- andy & woody fall into the la-z-boy chair and spin around
and around.

next, andy uses the la-z-boy foot rest as a catapult.

andy flings woody across the room to the sofa.

                         andy
                   (raising his arms)
            score!

song ends

woody lies limp on the sofa while andy is heard talking to
his mother.

                         andy (o.s.)
            wow!  cool!

                         mrs. davis (o.s.)
            whadda ya think?

                         andy (o.s.)
            oh, this looks great, mom!

angle: the adjoining dining room

mrs. davis, andy's thirty eight-year-old mom, has just
finished decorating the area with streamers and balloons.  a
banner is draped across the archway.  it reads: "happy
birthday andy."

woody's frozen face stares in the direction of the birthday
decorations.

                         andy
            can we leave this up 'til we move?

                         mrs. davis
            well, sure, we can leave it up.

                         andy
            yeah!

                         mrs. davis
            now go get molly.  your friends are
            going to be here any minute.

                         andy
            okay.

andy picks up woody from the couch and runs upstairs.

                         andy
            it's party time, woody!
