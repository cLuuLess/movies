int. upstairs hallway

andy's door creaks open and a lone army man ventures forth
to make sure the coast is clear.  satisfied, he motions for
the others to proceed.  squads of soldiers march into the
hall carrying a baby monitor and a jump rope.

the army men each leapfrog behind the stairway banisters and
hold their positions while the sargent surveys the scene
below through his binoculars.

directly below, mrs. davis passes through the hallway
rounding up andy and all his birthday guests.

                         mrs. davis
            okay, c'mon kids!  everyone in the
            living room.  it's almost time for
            the presents.

once mrs. davis and the children are out of sight, the
sargent motions to his men with a silent hand signal.

two paratroopers jump out through the railing, parachuting
down to the floor below.
