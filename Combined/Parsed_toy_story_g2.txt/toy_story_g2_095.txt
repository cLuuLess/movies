ext. back of moving truck

the toys are gathered around slinky, his spring splayed out
on the floor.

                         slinky
            i shoulda held on longer.

lenny looks out the back again.

                         lenny
            look!  look!  it's woody and buzz!
            comin' up fast!

the toys run to the opening and cheer.

angle: buzz and woody

the rocket is so strong that it begins to lift buzz and
woody off the rc car.  woody manages to continue holding
onto rc -- but not for long.

the toys cheering turns to screaming as they rush to get out
of the way of the oncoming "rc rocket."

                         rex
            take cover!!

woody is forced to let go of the rc car.

they separate, sending the two toys upward and rc into the
back of the truck.

rc smashes into potato head, sending all of his parts flying.
