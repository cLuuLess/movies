int. upstairs hallway - continuous

woody races down the corridor...

                         woody
                   (to himself)
            there's no place like home.
            there's no place like home.
            there's no place like home...

...turns onto the top of the stairwell, down a few steps,
and is confronted by...

scud

asleep on the landing.

woody freezes inches away from the sleeping beast.  he
slowly backs up the stairs.

suddenly buzz appears and pulls woody back against the
hallway wall.  he covers woody's mouth with his hand.

                         woody
                   (muffled gasp)


                         buzz
                   (whisper)
            another stunt like that, cowboy --
            you're going to get us killed.

                         woody
                   (pulling buzz's hand away)
            don't tell me what to do!

                         buzz
            shhh!

buzz checks to make sure scud is still asleep and then darts
across the stairwell opening to the other end of the hallway.
once safely across, he motions for woody to follow.

woody cowardly crawls on all fours across the open area and
meets up with buzz.

as he stands...

woody's pullstring ring

gets caught on one of the curls of the wrought iron railing.

the toys begin to creep down the hallway, unaware that
woody's pullstring is being pulled farther and farther
until --

it snaps off the iron railing and flies back towards woody.

                         woody (voice box)
            yeeeeeee-haaaaaaa!!

both buzz and woody leap in surprise at the sound of woody's
voice box.

angle: scud's eye

it opens.

woody vainly attempts to stifle the recoiling pullstring.

                         woody (voice box)
                   (continued)
            giddy-up partner!...

growling, scud starts up the stairs.

                         woody (voice box)
                   (continued)
            ...we got to get this wagon train a
            movin'!

woody and buzz take off running.

                         buzz
            split up!

two doors are ajar at the other end of the hallway.  buzz
dives behind one while woody jumps into...

a closet

woody slams the door shut just as scud reaches the top of
the landing.  crashed can be heard from behind the closet
door, getting scud's attention.

buzz peeks out from his doorway at scud sniffing and
growling at the closet.

sensing movement behind him, scud whips around and starts to
enter buzz's doorway.

sfx: snoring

the noise stops the dog in his tracks.  both scud and buzz
look up to see...
