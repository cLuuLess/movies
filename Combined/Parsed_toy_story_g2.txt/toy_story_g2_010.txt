int. downstairs hallway

as soon as mom is gone, the sargent motions for his men to
proceed toward a nearby houseplant that looks into the
living room.

the sargent then notices an injured soldier struggling to
drag himself forward -- a casualty of mrs. davis' foot.  the
sargent helps the injured soldier to his feet.

                         wounded soldier
                   (moans)
            go on without me.  just go!

                         slinky
            a good soldier never leaves a man
            behind.

the sargent motions to the remaining men above.  they lower
themselves via jump rope, riding the baby monitor.  once
downstairs, they hustle the baby monitor towards the
houseplant.  suddenly...

a ball

bounces into the hallway, followed by the sound of footsteps
and kid clamor.

the sargent, supporting his wounded man, reaches the plant,
right on the heels of the squad with the baby monitor.  they
conceal themselves in the house plant just before the
children run by.
