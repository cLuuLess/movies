                         buzz
                   (continued)
            ...i'm just a little depressed,
            that's all.  i can get through this.

buzz reaches the center of the hallway and drops to his knees.

                         buzz
            oh, i'm a sham!!

                         woody
                   (loud whisper)
            sh-h-h-h-h!!  quiet, buzz.

                         buzz
            look at me!  i can't even fly out
            of a window!

woody stops short.  he looks down the hallway in the
direction of sid's room.

angle: sid's bedroom window

woody can see straight out sid's window across the way to
andy's bedroom window.

                         buzz
                   (continued)
            but -- the hat looked good.  tell
            me the hat looked good!  the apron
            is a bit much, it's not my color...

                         woody
            out the window...buzz, you're a
            genius!

woody grabs the coil of christmas lights and drags buzz
towards sid's room.

                         woody
                   (continued)
            come on, this way!

                         buzz
            years of academy training...wasted!!
