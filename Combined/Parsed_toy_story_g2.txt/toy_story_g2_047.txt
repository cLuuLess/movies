ext. andy's house - night

rex points a flashlight out of andy's bedroom window while
bo peep, slinky, hamm and potato head look on.

some bushes rustle below.

                         rex
            hey, you guys!  i think i've found
            him.  buzz!  is that you?!

rex points the flashlight beam at the shaking bushes.  the
annoyed meow of a cat is heard.

                         rex
            whiskers!  will you get out of
            here?!  you're interfering with the
            search and rescue.

sfx: approaching car

rex turns off the flashlight.

                         rex
                   (whispering)
            look!  they're home!

the toys duck behind the sill.

the davis' family van pulls into the driveway.  andy and mrs.
davis get out.

                         andy
            mom, have you seen woody?

                         mrs. davis
            where was the last place you left him?

                         andy
                   (searching the van)
            right here in the van.

                         mrs. davis
            oh, i'm sure he's there.  you're
            just not looking hard enough.

                         andy
            he's not here, mom.  woody's gone.

the toys all look at one another.

                         bo peep
                   (gasp)
            woody's gone?!

                         hamm
            well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran
            away.

hamm, potato head and rex walk away from the window.
                         mr. potato head
            huh?!  huh?!  i told you he was
            guilty.

                         rex
            who would've thought he was capable
            of such atrocities?!

bo peep and slinky are left alone at the window, visibly
crestfallen.

                         bo peep
            oh, slink, i hope he's okay.
