frantic, woody walks over to the edge of the desk.

                         woody
            buzz!  will you get up here and
            give me a hand?!

buzz's severed arm comes flying into view and lands by
woody's feet.

                         woody
                   (insincerely)
            ha ha.  that's very funny, buzz.
                   (exploding)
            this is serious!!

                         rex (o.s.)
            hey, woody!?  where'd ya go?

                         mr. potato head (o.s.)
            he's lyin'.  buzz ain't there.
