               ext. forest, stream - day

               it is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals 
               cry out. a rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, 
               grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move. he--
               perceval--is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with 
               an endearing and childlike smile.

                                     perceval
                              (to the rabbit)
                         sorry. hungry.

               a din is heard to the forest, and it grows. perceval glances 
               around, panicked. the sound is the rubbing of leather upon 
               leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor 
               hovers over the terrified boy.

                                     perceval
                              (stuttering)
                         have i taken too much?

               he lets the rabbit go free. the threatening figure dismounts. 
               and perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and 
               scooping a fish out.

                                     perceval
                              (desperately trying 
                              to ingratiate)
                         i had rabbit yesterday. today i'll 
                         eat fish... no?

               he returns the fish to the water. the figure steps into a 
               pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor. 
               it is lancelot.

                                     lancelot
                         don't be afraid.

               perceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels.

                                     perceval
                         you're an angel! not a devil...

               lancelot laughs and pulls the boy to his feet.

                                     lancelot
                         just a man. a knight in the king's 
                         service.

                                     perceval
                         you're a man?!
                              (he reaches out to 
                              touch lancelot)
                         ...with metal skin!

               perceval is beside himself with enthusiasm.

                                     perceval
                         can i grow metal skin?

               lancelot rolls his eyes, amused.

                                     lancelot
                         you've got a lot to learn.
