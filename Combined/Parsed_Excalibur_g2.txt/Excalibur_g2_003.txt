               ext. river, forest - day

               waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the 
               forest is a warlord, the duke of cornwall. he is flanked by 
               his armored warriors. lot of lowthean prominent among them. 
               they are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to 
               fight. behind them is an army of lesser knights.

               to the opposite bank come uther and merlin, a much smaller 
               force of knights, including uryens, lord of gore, surrounding 
               them.

                                     duke of cornwall
                         i spit on your truce, uther. if you 
                         want peace, throw down your swords.

               uther and the duke of cornwall glare at each other in silence 
               across the river. uther strains forward, burning with anger; 
               but merlin restrains him.

                                     uther
                         i should butcher all and every one 
                         of them. merlin, what is this wagging 
                         of tongues?

                                     merlin
                         just show the sword.

               uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the 
               air high over his head. the blade hums disquietingly and 
               leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. the marvel 
               instills dread in all present.

                                     merlin
                              (waxing eloquent)
                         behold the sword of power, excalibur. 
                         before uther, it belonged to lud, 
                         before lud, to beowulf, before beowulf 
                         to baldur the good, before baldur to 
                         thor himself and that was when the 
                         world was young and there were more 
                         than seven colors in the rainbow.
                              (and in an aside to 
                              uther)
                         speak the words.

                                     uther
                              (bellowing)
                         one land, one king! that is my peace!

               the duke of cornwall looks around nervously as some of his 
               knights fall to their knees in awe.

                                     duke of cornwall
                         lord uther, if i yield to the sword 
                         of power, what will you yield?

                                     uther
                         me, yield!?

               merlin urges uther hard.

                                     merlin
                              (a whisper)
                         he has given. now you must.

               the two knights glare at each other, rage contending with 
               anger.

                                     uther
                         the land from here to the sea is 
                         yours if you will enforce the king's 
                         will.

               the enemies lock eyes and merlin watches anxiously.

                                     duke of cornwall
                         done!

               all men from both sides break out in wild cheers.

                                     duke of cornwall
                         my lord king uther, let us feast 
                         together. to my castle. lord merlin, 
                         you must join -

               but merlin is nowhere in sight.
