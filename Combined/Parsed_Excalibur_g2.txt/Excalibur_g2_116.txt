               echoing in the vaulted corridors outside the hall, the 
               knight's whisper stabs arthur.

               the words now seem borne on the whistling wind and follow 
               the king wherever he goes in search of merlin. he comes upon 
               a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, 
               his hand under her gown. arthur notes the sacrilege in 
               silence, and continues on his way.
