               arthur and merlin are back in the same spot, having in fact 
               never moved at all, but traveled on the spell of merlin's 
               words alone.

                                     merlin
                         ...it is so much more than a scaly 
                         monster. it is everything!

               arthur's eyes shine with the brilliance of the vision.

                                     arthur
                         and if i am to be king of everything, 
                         lord and commoner, beast, leaf and 
                         rock, i must use its voice, its claws, 
                         its power.
