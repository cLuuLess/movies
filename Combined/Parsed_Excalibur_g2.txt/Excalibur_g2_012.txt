               ext. cliff above the sea - twilight

               the advancing front envelops merlin and uther, eddying around 
               the stones.  all else is obliterated.

                                     merlin
                         mount your horse.

               the king does.

                                     merlin
                         ride straight to the castle, across 
                         the sea of fog.

               uther spurs straight for the edge of the cliff, then reins 
               in his horse abruptly.

                                     uther
                         but the cliff, the sea...

               merlin rages, crazed.

                                     merlin
                         ride across! across the bridges of 
                         desire. your lust will hold you up. 
                         for i have just woven it into the 
                         fabric of the world. this is magic - 
                         making solid what is in the mind, 
                         and unsolid, that which is already 
                         solid.

               he gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff.

               the horse and uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping 
               off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats 
               ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they 
               gallop across the fog.
