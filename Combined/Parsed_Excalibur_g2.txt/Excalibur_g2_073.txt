               ext. farmyard - day

               the knight is lancelot, in his mirror-like armor. he rides 
               into the cluster of houses and barns that make up the farm. 
               there are other armored men there, around a cart half-loaded 
               with loot. they smile nervously at lancelot. the farmers are 
               blank with fear.

               lancelot stops in the middle of the yard. a knight among the 
               armored men comes forward.

                                     knight
                         good day, sir.

                                     lancelot
                         good day to you.

               and he also acknowledges with a nod the ashen-faced patriarch 
               of the community.

               lancelot spurs his horse on, and the knight sighs with relief. 
               but then he reins his horse to a stop. he has sensed 
               something. he turns his head, his hooded eyes on the knight 
               and his men, and they squirm inwardly.
