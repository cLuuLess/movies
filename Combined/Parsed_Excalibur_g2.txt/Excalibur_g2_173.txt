               ext. moors by the sea - fog - late day

               arthur and perceval ride alone, the accompanying knights 
               gone, the dying and the dead and the crazed horses all around 
               them.

               squires are carrying kay upon his shield. he is dead. arthur 
               leaps to the ground and reaches out to touch his face, and 
               closes his eyes. he stifles his tears.

                                     arthur
                         has anyone seen lancelot?

                                     squire
                         he lies over there, sir.

               arthur rushes off, perceval following on horseback.

               lancelot is mortally wounded, blood flowing from his abdomen, 
               his eyes open but his gaze dead. arthur falls to his side.

                                     arthur
                         squire! here!

               but there is no one now except the dead and wounded, and 
               perceval, who dismounts to watch over the king, sword drawn. 
               desperate, arthur stops the wound with his hand. lancelot's 
               eyes are sightless, but tears spill from them.

                                     lancelot
                         arthur.

                                     arthur
                         lancelot, i will save you... don't 
                         die.

               he tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound 
               with it.

                                     lancelot
                         my salvation is to die a knight of 
                         the round table.

                                     arthur
                         you are that and much more. you are 
                         its greatest knight, you are what is 
                         best in men. now we will be together--

                                     lancelot
                         --it is the old wound, that has been 
                         opened. i have always known it would 
                         be the gateway to my death, for it 
                         has never healed. let my heart do 
                         its job, my king, and pump me empty...

               arthur takes lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against 
               the knight's brow.

                                     lancelot
                              (a death whisper)
                         guenevere, has she come to you, is 
                         she queen again?

               he lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at lancelot.

                                     arthur
                         she is, lancelot.

               a boyish smile settles over the features of lancelot's face, 
               and he dies. arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut 
               tight.

               a strong wind rises. perceval kneels beside arthur.

                                     perceval
                         the fog is lifting. only we remain 
                         alive.
