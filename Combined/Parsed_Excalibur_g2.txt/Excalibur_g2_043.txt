               int. tent - day

               he enters. the saddle trunk has been emptied on the floor, 
               equipment is scattered all over. arthur is shocked, 
               nonetheless he rummages madly. finally he stops, on the verge 
               of tears.

                                     arthur
                         it's been stolen....
