               ext. stonehenge - night

               arthur is still on his knees, and he sits back, looking up. 
               but the atmosphere is different, within a dream, and the 
               stones of the henge loom larger over him now.

                                     arthur
                         what is this place? it is rumored 
                         merlin, that you drew your power 
                         from these circles...

               a hand ruffles the king's hair. he turns, and is face to 
               face with merlin, standing over him. arthur looks at him 
               without surprise, as though the intervening years never were. 
               merlin begins to laugh his hideous giggle. arthur rises.

                                     arthur
                         quiet. you'll wake the men, and they 
                         must fight tomorrow for their very 
                         lives.

                                     merlin
                         i know. i have heard noises and echoes 
                         through the stones...

                                     arthur
                         what is this place, merlin?

                                     merlin
                         it is like a tree. the roots of the 
                         stones spread out across the land 
                         and they draw on the thoughts and 
                         actions of men. like sap those human 
                         matters course through the stones 
                         feeding the stars that are the leaves 
                         of the tree. and the stars whisper 
                         back to men the future course of 
                         events.
                              (becoming passionate)
                         but the earth is being torn apart, 
                         its metals stolen, and the balance 
                         is broken and the lines of power no 
                         longer converge. in fact, i nearly 
                         didn't make it in one piece.

               he limps affectedly and stretches with exaggerated pain.

                                     merlin
                         but, i'm here.

                                     arthur
                         where have you been these many years? 
                         is it true that morgana--

                                     merlin
                         --stories... you brought me back. 
                         your love brought me back. back to 
                         where you are now, in the land of 
                         dreams...

                                     arthur
                         is this a dream? tell me, merlin!

               merlin smiles, turns and leaves, heading for arthur's camp, 
               giggling. arthur starts off after him and awakens from the 
               dream when he walks into one of the stones. it takes him a 
               moment to realize that merlin has vanished.

                                     arthur
                         merlin?!

               he hurries away toward the camp.
