               ext. outside the castle - night

               a bellowing dragon advances. its eyes burn, its scales gleam 
               from light shining from within. it snorts fire from its 
               nostrils.

               uryens and lot, caradoc and turquine, the great knights in 
               command of the siege of leondegrance's castle, back away 
               speechless as the monster descends upon their unprepared war 
               camp. all around them, squires and lesser knights flee in 
               panic and confusion.

               only a dozen or so remain with their leaders. the group backs 
               up against the swampy moat that surrounds the castle, waiting 
               with swords drawn.

               the dragon moves closer, and now it becomes apparent that it 
               is nothing more than a force of knights and footmen. their 
               shields glinting in the moonlight are the dragon's scales, 
               torches its burning eyes. and the snorting flames from its 
               nostrils are only merlin doing a fire-eater's trick.

               the dragon form dissolves, and a banner rises bearing the 
               emblem of the dragon, and under it, arthur and ector and kay 
               lead a charge of twenty knights.

               in arthur's hands, excalibur leaves an electric glow upon 
               the air.
