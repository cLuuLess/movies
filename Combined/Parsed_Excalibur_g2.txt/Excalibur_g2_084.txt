               ext. site of the sword in the stone - evening

               the chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees 
               from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and 
               howls. merlin advances along the edge of the forest. he stops 
               by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild. he 
               forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base 
               of the stone. he kneels beside it and plucks it. he admires 
               its strange flowers; he smells them.

               two feet appear at his side. he rises to be face to face 
               with morgana. they look deep into each other. then merlin 
               breaks the silence.

                                     merlin
                         you left your husband's side? you 
                         left your brother's wedding?

                                     morgana
                         is that mandrake, lord merlin?

                                     merlin
                         it is.

                                     morgana
                         can it truly be used for magic?

               merlin smiles at last, and morgana does, her eyes piercing, 
               cruel and lovely.

                                     merlin
                         yes... sometimes...

               his gaze drifts toward the chapel.

                                     merlin
                         ...there are many powers in this 
                         world.
