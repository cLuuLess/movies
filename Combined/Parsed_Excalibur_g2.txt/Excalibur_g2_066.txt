               int. banquet hall, camelyarde castle - evening

               the soft beat of psaltery and the liquid flow of lute. a 
               serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is 
               carried across the hall. it is laid on the long raised table 
               before arthur, who presides in the middle. he looks at it 
               suspiciously and blushes, remembering the afternoon; and it 
               looks back at him accusingly with its cherry eye.

               guenevere is dancing around her father, lovely, gliding, 
               sensual. she sees arthur and the rabbit and laughs out-right. 
               he twists off a leg of the rabbit and sinks his teeth into 
               it to hide his embarrassment. guenevere passes to another 
               partner, smiling at him, radiant. arthur watches her, his 
               heart breaking. he is in love.

               merlin leans close.

                                     merlin
                         a king must marry, after all.

                                     arthur
                         ...of course...

               only then does he realize that merlin has understood 
               everything. he is annoyed at being so transparent.

                                     arthur
                         i love her. if she would be my queen, 
                         my dreams would be answered.

                                     merlin
                              (mischievous)
                         there are maidens as fair, and fairer 
                         than guenevere. if i put my mind to 
                         it, i could see them now, many of 
                         them, weeping for love of you, 
                         watching the hills for you coming 
                         from the high towers of their castles. 
                         offering you their every favor. rich, 
                         clever--but if it is to be guenevere, 
                         so be it.

               a shadow of doubt crosses arthur's brow.

                                     arthur
                         who will it be? put your mind to it, 
                         then.

                                     merlin
                         guenevere. and a beloved friend who 
                         will betray you.

                                     arthur
                              (smiling)
                         guenevere...

                                     merlin
                         you're not listening. your heart is 
                         not. love is deaf as well as blind.

               guenevere approaches, smiling and coquettish. she slaps her 
               hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before 
               arthur.

                                     guenevere
                         they are only for you, for in them i 
                         mixed things that heal, but not too 
                         quickly; and things that make limbs 
                         sleepy, preventing escape, but keep 
                         one's mind sharp.

               she smiles at arthur's embarrassment and confusion.

                                     arthur
                         what's in them?

               she takes a cake and bites into it.

                                     guenevere
                         it is an ancient mixture, containing 
                         only soft, unborn grains, and flavored 
                         with roses. the rest is secret.

               guenevere offers one to arthur, and he hesitates, looking at 
               it.

                                     merlin
                         looking at the cake is like looking 
                         at the future. until you have savored 
                         its bitterness and its sweetness, 
                         its texture and its perfume, what do 
                         you really know? and then, of course, 
                         it will he too late.

               arthur bites into the cake, and guenevere looks deep into 
               his eyes.

                                     merlin
                         too late...

                                                                  fade out:

               a legend appears:

               "...but for years war kept arthur from thoughts of marriage."
