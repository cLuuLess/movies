               war tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees. near 
               the banner of the dragon a doe grazes. arthur is older, in 
               battle-scarred plate armor, pacing and angry. he is watched 
               by his wounded and bruised knights--kay, uryens, lot, 
               leondegrance, caradoc, and some new young faces among the 
               ranks. no one talks.

               the harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival 
               of a horse. all eyes watch it walk into the camp. a knight 
               is slouched in the saddle.

               arthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some 
               of the knights.

               he eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet. it is 
               sir ector, and his hauberk is badly dented. tears burn in 
               arthur's eyes.

                                     sir ector
                         he is the mightiest and fairest of 
                         knights.

                                     arthur
                         we fought and won battles, and now 
                         one man defeats all my knights? i 
                         will go.

               he pushes past the knights and goes to his horse. kay steps 
               in front of him.

                                     sir kay
                         a king must not engage in single 
                         contest. i'll go again.

               arthur rises into the saddle and takes a jousting spear from 
               the rack.

                                     arthur
                         where is merlin?

               the squires are silent.

               arthur gallops off in the direction sir ector came from. his 
               knights are afraid for him.
