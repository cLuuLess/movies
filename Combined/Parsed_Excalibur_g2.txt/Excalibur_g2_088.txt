               ext. sparse forest - day

               lancelot is cantering and perceval is running alongside, 
               shouting in gasps.

                                     perceval
                         i'll learn... take me... to the 
                         king... what's a... king?

               lancelot shakes his head and spurs the horse into a gallop. 
               perceval lengthens his stride, and keeps up! lancelot reins 
               to a halt.

                                     lancelot
                         very well. climb up.

                                     perceval
                         i will run.

                                     lancelot
                         listen, boy, it's more than twenty 
                         days from here.

                                     perceval
                         twenty days!? the world is that big?
