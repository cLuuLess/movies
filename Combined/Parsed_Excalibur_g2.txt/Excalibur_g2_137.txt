               ext. gate, inside and outside camelot - day

               the drawbridge lowers slowly, and arthur moves away from kay 
               and the other knights, and advances across it.

               rooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds 
               camelot. a group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest. 
               one steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal 
               defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his 
               body. he is mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of 
               extraordinary beauty. a page follows ten steps behind him 
               bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded. arthur stops 
               at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps 
               from him. kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the 
               drawbridge.

               mordred kneels on one knee.

                                     mordred
                         father...

                                     arthur
                         rise, mordred.

                                     mordred
                         i have come to claim what is mine, 
                         father.

                                     arthur
                         i recognize you only as my son, no 
                         more.

                                     mordred
                              (his tone is scathing)
                         and you are the great king? the lords 
                         have rebelled. invaders attack the 
                         coasts. crops don't grow. there is 
                         nothing but plague and hunger in the 
                         land. only i am feared. i will be 
                         king. you may have lost excalibur, 
                         but i have found my own weapon of 
                         power. there.

               he points to the huge lance. the page pulls a string and the 
               hood drops, revealing a diabolically sharp spear tip, its 
               metal glinting menacingly.

                                     mordred
                         the very spear that pierced the side 
                         of christ as he died on the cross.

                                     arthur
                         your mother told you that?

               mordred is thrown off by the doubt arthur has cast. arthur 
               looks upon his son, desperately trying to read him.

                                     arthur
                         i cannot offer you the land, only my 
                         love...

                                     mordred
                         and i offer only this, father. to 
                         commit with passion and pleasure all 
                         the evils that you failed to commit, 
                         as man and king.

               arthur goes forward to embrace his son, a desperate attempt. 
               mordred recoils.

                                     mordred
                         we will embrace only in battle. 
                         father, and i will touch you only 
                         with the blade of my spear.

               arthur is on the verge of tears.

                                     mordred
                         i will muster a great force of 
                         knights, and i will return to fight 
                         for what is mine.

                                     arthur
                         so be it.

               he turns and re-enters the castle, the drawbridge pulled up 
               immediately behind him. he is hunched over, broken.
