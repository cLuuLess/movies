               ext. forest glade - dawn

               the sky is red; so is the steel of excalibur. lancelot awakens 
               and starts at what he sees. his cry stirs guenevere. they 
               are horrified to see excalibur impaled in the ground between 
               their entwined bodies. it has pierced their union without 
               grazing their flesh. they leap up and back away, unable to 
               speak at first.

                                     lancelot
                         why didn't he kill us?

                                     guenevere
                         he has given up.

               she kneels before the sword, embracing the hilt to her breast.

                                     lancelot
                         the king without his sword, the land 
                         without a king...

                                     guenevere
                         we are to blame.

               lancelot stumbles into the forest, berserk with guilt. he 
               rages against a small tree, crying out, and he rips its roots 
               from the ground, the terrible tearing and renting the symbol 
               of his own inner torment.

               guenevere sinks to the ground next to lancelot's empty armor 
               and his abandoned sword.
