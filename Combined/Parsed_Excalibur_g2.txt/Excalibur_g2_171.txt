               ext. moors by the sea - fog - dawn

               arthur, with kay and perceval, canters through the white 
               fog. they are flanked by a phalanx of knights in silver armor.

                                     arthur
                         kay, you will lead the attack. 
                         perceval, you will stay with me.

               kay draws his sword in salute, elated.

                                     arthur
                         be cautious, my brother.

               he spurs forward, while arthur reins to a halt, watching him 
               disappear. perceval and a few knights stay behind and surround 
               the king.

                                     arthur
                         in this battle there is one thing i 
                         must do, that no one else can. find 
                         mordred and kill him.

               ahead, the horrible din of joined battle.

               in the swirling fog, clash of arms follows clash of arms. 
               there is confusion, for each knight is unable to see if he 
               is fighting friend or foe until they are upon each other.

               the battle becomes a series of vicious duels, a knight in 
               silver armor against a knight in black-burnished armor, just 
               glimpsed in the fog that is alive with the clang of sword on 
               shield, the pounding of hooves, the cries of the dying.

               squires drag away their wounded knights, their young faces 
               pale at the sight of the carnage.

               kay is unhorsed but picks himself up and mounts a riderless 
               horse, rejoining the combat although he is bleeding.
