               ext. stonehenge - late evening

               arthur slips off into sleep. the stones around him distort. 
               he speaks softly, but then though the words continue, his 
               lips are closed.

                                     arthur
                         ...if only you could be at my side, 
                         merlin, to see me wield excalibur 
                         once more...
