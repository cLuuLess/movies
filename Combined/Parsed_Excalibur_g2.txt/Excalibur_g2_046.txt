               ext. the sword in the stone - day

               arthur stops at the edge of the dark forest, totally dejected, 
               when he sees the sword in the stone. he walks up to it, his 
               face lighting up, brimming with innocence. he is alone, as 
               everyone has returned to the jousting ground.

                                     arthur
                         if only kay could have it...

               he smiles, forgetting his troubles, a boy again living in a 
               fairy tale. he grasps the sword by the hilt and it comes 
               away easily from its stone lock.

               not expecting it to, he nearly falls. he stares at it, 
               terribly excited and surprised: he tucks it under his arm 
               and rushes back.
