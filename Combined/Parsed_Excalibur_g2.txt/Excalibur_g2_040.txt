               ext. the sword in the stone - day

               the victor, leondegrance, rides up to the stone and dismounts. 
               each great knight with his coterie of lesser knights comes 
               to watch. a charge of expectation is in the air, although 
               most knights are glowering with envy.

               leondegrance of camelyarde ascends to the sword, grabs it by 
               the hilt, and begins to tug with all his might. excalibur is 
               immovable. the moment of tension passes. leondegrance staggers 
               toward his waiting squires, who lead him away. all the others 
               return to the battle sport.
