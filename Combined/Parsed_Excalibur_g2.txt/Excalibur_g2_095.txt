               ext. edge of the forest, walls of camelot - night.

               a mounted knight stands motionless at the edge of the forest, 
               his armor gleaming with dark lustre. it is lancelot. his 
               eyes are raised to the high window, where he sees guenevere. 
               he watches her in silence. in the high window guenevere draws 
               the curtain and lancelot reins back into the forest.
