               int. hall of the round table - day

               sun streams in. many of the knights are in attendance, in 
               full armor.

               ladies and pages watch from dark corners. arthur addresses 
               the fellowship.

               he holds the cracked chalice in his hands. he burns with a 
               new-found fervor.

                                     arthur
                         who will ride the labyrinths of the 
                         forest, to the very root of his soul, 
                         to the very ends of the earth, to 
                         find the secret that will redeem us 
                         from the evil that has fallen upon 
                         us, and make this chalice, and 
                         ourselves, whole again?

               gawain rises and draws his sword in salute.

                                     sir gawain
                         i will ride forth in the name of 
                         that quest, and commit my strength 
                         and my soul to it.

               perceval, kay and a few others draw their swords and touch 
               their lips to the blades in oath. sunbeams splash off their 
               armor.

                                     perceval
                         i will go.

               the rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, 
               but the resolution within them is not strong. arthur comes 
               forward to gawain.

                                     arthur
                         gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, 
                         that we may never meet again, that 
                         the fellowship will be no more...

               he embraces gawain, tears in his eyes. he turns to perceval, 
               and perceval kneels.

                                     perceval
                         we will find the secret or die.

               arthur kisses the young knight's brow. then he turns to kay.

                                     arthur
                         kay, i know your heart yearns to go, 
                         but i am prisoner to my duties, and 
                         you must be to yours, at my side.

               arthur and kay watch the knights file out till the hall is 
               empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant.

                                                                  fade out:

               a legend appears:

               "for nine years they searched. morgana's power grew in the 
               land."
