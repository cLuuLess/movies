               int. morgana's chamber - night

               the 'duke' stands in the doorway. igrayne herself is 
               surprised.

                                     igrayne
                         look, here is your father. it was 
                         just a dream, little one.

                                     'duke' of cornwall
                         come igrayne.

               igrayne kisses morgana, tucks her in and returns to her own 
               room, closing the door. the child doesn't know whether to 
               believe the truth of the dream or the waking truth.
