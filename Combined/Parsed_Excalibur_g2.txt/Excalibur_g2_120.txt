               int. chapel, camelot - night

               arthur enters, pale and haunted. mass is being celebrated, 
               and some knights are present. those not asleep whisper to 
               each other about the king. the sound of an approaching storm 
               is heard.

               as the priest raises the chalice to consecrate the wine. 
               arthur comes down the aisle and steps onto the altar. he 
               reaches out to grasp the chalice from the priest's hands.
