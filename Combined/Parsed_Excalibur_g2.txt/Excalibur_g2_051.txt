               ext. site of the sword in the stone - day

               uryens and lot, and caradoc, turquine, and the other lords 
               have mounted, and are moving out, when from the rear guard a 
               bowman in lot's service draws upon the unarmored figure of 
               arthur across the cheering crowd. the bowman lets the arrow 
               fly.

               it flies over the heads of the crowd, unseen.

               except by merlin at arthur's side. he extends his arms halfway 
               up, his fists clenched tightly as if drawing urgently on the 
               power within himself. the sound of wings is heard as he flaps 
               his arms.

               the arrow flies toward arthur.

               arthur sees the arrow coming right at him, when a swooping 
               crow plucks it out of the air.

               arthur watches the crow flapping its wings, climbing swiftly, 
               the arrow in its beak, disappearing over the forest. only he 
               has noticed.

               when he turns merlin is no longer at his side; to the 
               puzzlement of all. and arthur is all of a sudden terribly 
               alone and afraid, as people from all sides clamor for his 
               attention and guidance.
