               ext. stonehenge, the moors - late evening

               he stops in the ancient circle of druidic stones.

                         i am outnumbered ten to one by 
                         mordred's forces. merlin, i need you 
                         at my side as you were once, my 
                         friend, to give me courage. there 
                         are no war tricks that will fool 
                         mordred. he was weaned on blood.

               he falls on his knees in front of the stone, tired, between 
               thinking and dreaming, and he bangs his mailed fist against 
               it.

                                     arthur
                         more than i ever did, i need you 
                         now. where are you, merlin? is it 
                         true that morgana has trapped you?
