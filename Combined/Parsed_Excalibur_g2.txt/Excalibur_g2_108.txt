               ext. forest glade - night

               only nature will ever see their love; the creatures of the 
               air, tree and ground witness the final reality of their 
               passion and sense its unfathomable depths, singing of it in 
               a hundred languages. lancelot and guenevere are naked and 
               interlocked, one being, suspended in the darkness in the eye 
               of the forest.
