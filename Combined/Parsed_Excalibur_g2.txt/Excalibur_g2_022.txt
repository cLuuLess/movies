               int. hall, tintagel castle - dawn

               his lieutenants deposit the duke of cornwall's bloodless 
               body upon the long table. his eyes are wide open, icy and 
               cunning even in death. the ladies of the castle support and 
               comfort the grief-stricken igrayne as she approaches the 
               body of her husband. morgana hangs onto her mother's gown.

                                     igrayne
                         when did it happen? where?

                                     lieutenant
                         in the camp of uther, my lady, just 
                         after nightfall.

                                     igrayne
                         it can't be. he came to me, to his 
                         bed, last night.

                                     lady
                         it was his spirit, yearning for you 
                         in his hour of death, that visited 
                         you.

                                     igrayne
                         his spirit?

               pale with grief, igrayne stares at her dead husband in 
               silence.

               then her hand drifts to her stomach. when she talks again, 
               undone and resolved, it is to all and herself:

                                     igrayne
                         tintagel castle falls to uther. but 
                         what shall become of me, and the 
                         child i bear?

               morgana shows no distress. she runs her baby hands across 
               her father's face and closes his eyes. the intensity that 
               was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning 
               eyes.
