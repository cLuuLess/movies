                         mean that i am to be king?

               sir ector is dumbstruck.

                                     sir ector
                         did you free the sword, boy?

                         i... did, father.

               ector looks at his son amazed, wanting to believe but not 
               able to.

                                     sir ector
                         we must go to the stone at once.

               with excalibur in hand ector of morven heads for the stone, 
               kay following, and arthur too, the boy flushed with excitement 
               but a little worried, not understanding what is happening.
