               int. convent courtyard - dawn

               she leads the king, his footsteps ringing in the silent 
               cloister, past the doors to the cells. his armor is wet with 
               dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster. nuns whisper 
               at his transit. she opens the door to a cell and arthur steps 
               inside.
