               ext. barren land - evening

               asleep in the saddle, perceval rides across burnt and 
               smoldering fields. the horse walks aimlessly; it is the same 
               animal, mangy and old. a hoard of children in filthy rags 
               closes in on him, begging, pulling at the horse's trappings. 
               he bolts awake and reins away. his eyes are red and feverish.

               wild hope grips him when he sees a glinting light by a 
               farmhouse. he spurs the horse forward into a gallop.
