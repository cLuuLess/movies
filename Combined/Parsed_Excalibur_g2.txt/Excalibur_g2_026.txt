               int. igrayne's bedchamber, tintagel castle - night

               at his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and 
               morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the 
               bed beside her. ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, 
               the blood of birth still wet upon it.

                                     uther
                         out!

               the ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to 
               igrayne.

                                     uther
                         what is it, lady?

               terrified of him, igrayne faces him the best she can.

                                     igrayne
                         a boy, sir. rest yourself.

               uther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, 
               exhausted. he notices morgana, who stares at him.

                                     uther
                         send the girl away.

                                     igrayne
                         she is just a child -

                                     uther
                         out!

               igrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek.

                                     igrayne
                              (whispering)
                         go now. come back later.

               the child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes.

                                     uther
                         she watches me with her father's 
                         eyes.

               he grasps the newborn baby with his iron hand, and pulls it 
               to himself. he looks upon it with wonder, with a gentleness 
               that is unexpected.

                                     uther
                         igrayne, is he mine, or -

               he can't bring himself to say his name. she hesitates on the 
               edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron 
               cradle.

                                     igrayne
                         the night he died, a man loved me 
                         with great fierceness. he looked 
                         like my husband, spoke like, smelled 
                         like, felt like my own husband. but 
                         it was not he, for he was already 
                         dead. it wasn't his spirit, for this 
                         child, who was conceived that night, 
                         is flesh and blood. i know nothing 
                         more.

               uther draws a dagger. he lifts it.

                                     igrayne
                         no--

               but he uses it before igrayne can move. he severs the leather 
               thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest. he casts 
               it to the floor. his chest is smooth and milk-white in 
               striking contrast to his creased, weathered face. and beaming, 
               he holds the baby to it.

                                     uther
                         through him, i will learn to love 
                         them, for i am tired of battle. i 
                         will stay by his side and
                              (looking shyly at 
                              igrayne)
                         his mother's...

               igrayne's hatred for the man is at the very edge of becoming 
               love. the baby starts to cry.

                                     uther
                         here. it's hungry.

               and his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen 
               breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently. milk bubbles 
               from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it.

               igrayne weeps and uther watches proudly as the baby suckles.

               merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent 
               green-black as the feathers of the crows that were perched 
               by the window.

                                     uther
                         merlin! out of the sick sleep at 
                         last.

                                     merlin
                         doing what i did for you, it wasn't 
                         easy, you know. it takes it's toll. 
                         it took nine moons to get back my 
                         strength.

               uther avoids looking at him.

                                     merlin
                         now you must pay me.

                                     uther
                         i?

                                     merlin
                         the child is mine, uther. i have 
                         come for him.

               uther is shaken to his roots. igrayne watches, trying to 
               understand.

                                     uther
                         the oath. you didn't say--

                                     merlin
                         you didn't ask!

                                     igrayne
                         uther, is it true? don't let him 
                         take the child.

                                     uther
                         i swore an oath, igrayne. i made a 
                         pact with merlin.

               igrayne suddenly understands. she glares at uther.

                                     igrayne
                         it was you? you came to me that night. 
                         you are the father.

               uther is caught, and turns to merlin who is harsh and 
               unswaying.

                                     merlin
                         it's not for you, uther, hearth and 
                         home, wife and child.

                                     uther
                         to kill and be king, is that all?

                                     merlin
                         maybe not even that, uther. i thought 
                         once that you were the one to unite 
                         the land under one sword. but it'll 
                         take another, a greater king...

                                     uther
                         you strike me with words as hard as 
                         steel.

                                     merlin
                         they are not weapons, my friend, but 
                         truths. you betrayed the duke, stole 
                         his wife and took his castle, now no 
                         one trusts you. lot, uryens, your 
                         allies will turn against you. give 
                         me the child, uther, i will protect 
                         him. go back to your war tent.

               uther wrenches the baby from it's mother's breast and hands 
               him to merlin.

                                     uther
                              (in torment)
                         by the oath, take the devil child. 
                         take him!

               with the bawling baby under his cape, merlin exits. igrayne 
               pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under 
               her. she starts after merlin.

                                     igrayne
                         why?... why must he have the baby?

               uther stops her with his bulk and she claws savagely at his 
               chest to get past him. he weeps as he folds his arms around 
               her.
