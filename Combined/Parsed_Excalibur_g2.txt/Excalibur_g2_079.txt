               the field is pitched with war tents and pavilions decked for 
               holiday. nobles and knights flank the king and guenevere, a 
               beautiful vision in white samite, a wreath of flowers around 
               her head. lancelot leads a long file of prisoners to the 
               king. they fall to their knees, begging forgiveness; among 
               them is the man whom lancelot had spared before the altar.

                         these men repented before god for 
                         their evil deeds. those who would 
                         not, met their fate at the end of my 
                         sword.

                         i do. rise, lancelot, come with me.

               he rises and follows arthur and guenevere into the central 
               pavilion. pages draw its curtains closed as they pass inside.
