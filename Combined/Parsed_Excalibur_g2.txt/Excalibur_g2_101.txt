               int. cell - evening

               lancelot is staring into guenevere's eyes. she opens her 
               shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother 
               preparing to suckle a child. she presses her breast to his 
               wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him. she 
               whispers.

                                     guenevere
                         flesh on flesh. i will heal you.

               his body trembles and his eyes brim with tears. he is lost.
