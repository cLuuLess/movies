               ext. outside the castle - night

               arthur and his men charge into the enemy ranks. lot's and 
               uryens' people are pushed into the moat. although the water 
               is only waist-deep, the fallen, weighed down by their armor, 
               drown. the horses of the attackers are brought down, arthur's 
               among them. he pulls out from under it, limping. bleeding 
               form wounds, cutting, slashing, thrusting, he falls back 
               from the havoc of the charge.

               a small distance exists now between the foes, a brief respite. 
               uryens and lot, exhausted, bleeding, and fierce in their 
               rage:

                                     uryens
                         war-wise fighters, grown gray in 
                         battle, checkmated by a boy.

                                     lot
                         it's merlin's trickery, nothing more. 
                         i won't swear faith to that wizard's 
                         brat.

               arthur and his men have been joined by leondegrance and his 
               knights, few in number.

                                     arthur
                         let's finish this with a show of 
                         force. we have no more tricks and no 
                         more advantages.

               he rushes alone at the enemy, shouting at the top of his 
               lungs, excalibur flashing over his head, prepared to die.
