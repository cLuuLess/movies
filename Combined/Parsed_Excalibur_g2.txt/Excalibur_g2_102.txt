               int. hall of the round table, camelot - night

               the court is assembled, for the evening feast. there is music 
               and heavy drinking. some knights are slouched across the 
               table. lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the 
               drunken and frivolous knights. arthur catches it, and they 
               smile at each other.

                                     arthur
                         they miss the battlefield. i think 
                         we do too.

                                     lancelot
                         but one can still keep a sword sharp 
                         riding out in the name of the king's 
                         law.

               guenevere cannot tear her eyes from lancelot. he avoids her 
               look. arthur looks from guenevere to lancelot, and speaks 
               softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness.

                                     arthur
                         it is not easy for the young ones to 
                         learn knightly virtues without the 
                         hard teaching of war and quest. it 
                         is only your example, lancelot, that 
                         binds them now.

               then, addressing the hall:

                                     arthur
                         which is the greatest quality of 
                         knighthood? courage? compassion? 
                         loyalty? humility? what do you say, 
                         merlin?

               he is bent close to morgana, whispering. only when the hall 
               rings with laughter does he look up.

                                     merlin
                         what?
                              (then seeing he has 
                              an audience)
                         the greatest? they blend together 
                         like the metals we mix to make a 
                         good sword.

                                     arthur
                         i didn't ask for poetry. which is 
                         it?

               merlin looks from arthur to guenevere to lancelot to arthur.

                                     merlin
                         all right. truth. it must be truth, 
                         above all. when a man lies he murders 
                         some part of the world.

               an uneasy silence falls upon the feast. guenevere and lancelot 
               cannot look at each other, and arthur feels it. lancelot 
               jumps to his feet.

                                     lancelot
                         conversation and court life don't 
                         suit me. i must take my rest in the 
                         forest.

               guenevere stifles her dismay.

                                     arthur
                         hasn't merlin mended your wound?

                                     lancelot
                         it is deep...

               arthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself.

                                     arthur
                         you will be sorely missed. heal 
                         yourself and come back.

               the exchange has become closely intimate, even though they 
               stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall. 
               lancelot leaves. only guenevere cannot watch.
