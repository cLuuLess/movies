               ext. moors by the sea - sunset

               perceval returns to the king, terribly excited, shouting 
               from his horse:

                                     perceval
                         arthur!

               but arthur isn't there. perceval looks around him, he doesn't 
               understand. he sees a trail of blood. he spurs his horse and 
               follows the trail down to the sea.
