               int. chapel - evening

               arthur and guenevere are radiant with joy, and lancelot behind 
               them mirrors the ceremony of their joining in his armor; and 
               the sweet voices of the children fill the chapel as the bishop 
               pours the wine into the chalice, and lifts it up before him, 
               blessing it.

               he turns to the royal couple.

                                     bishop
                         drink this the blood of jesus christ 
                         our lord.

               the chalice seems to burn with a mystical light; and as the 
               chorus soars:

                                                                  fade out:

               a legend appears:

               "and arthur built his castle, camelot. and one day, in the 
               far reaches of the kingdom..."
