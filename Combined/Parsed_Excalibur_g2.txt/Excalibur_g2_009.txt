               ext. cliff above the sea - twilight

               uther and his knights, and merlin on a mule, ride to the 
               high promontory and dismount. here, overlooking the sea, is 
               a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and 
               hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans 
               and sighs.

               the knights watch as merlin and uther, leading his horse, 
               walk toward the stones. merlin strides into the circle, 
               turning to look at uther, who hesitates.

                                     merlin
                         come.

               uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but merlin halts 
               him with a gesture. uther's hand drops, and he enters the 
               circle with his horse.

               merlin and uther look out across the sea, to tintagel castle 
               high upon the cliff.

               merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, 
               and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he 
               marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. the wind 
               becomes stronger, and merlin's incantations become more 
               intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. until 
               merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind 
               buffets his slight frame.

               and then, for all to understand:

                                     merlin
                         i hold the balance of all things in 
                         my summoning. arise mists. come fog.
