               int. chapel, camelot - night.

               a bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, 
               and arthur is knocked back violently.

               rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified 
               knights. they and the priest back away. arthur is left alone. 
               he rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. 
               he kneels before it. steam hisses up as rain falls on it.
