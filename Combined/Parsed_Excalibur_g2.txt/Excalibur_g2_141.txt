               ext. river and underwater - evening

               the water is deeper and perceval is dragged under by the 
               weight of his armor. he struggles desperately to shed it, 
               half drowning.

               exhausted, he pulls himself up onto the muddy shore beside a 
               rotting sheep carcass, and around him, the daylight dies.
