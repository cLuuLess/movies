               int. chamber, tintagel castle - night

               a little girl of four awakens from a nightmare, a small lone 
               figure in her canopied bed. her eyes are ice, like her 
               father's.

                                     morgana
                         papa... papa...

               igrayne is soon at her side, lifting the child from the bed, 
               holding her tight.

                                     morgana
                         my father is dead...
