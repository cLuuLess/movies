               int. tent - morgana's dream

               she rises from her sleeping body.

                                     morgana
                         you provoke me, merlin.

                                     merlin
                         what's behind that beauty? a wizened, 
                         cold-hearted snake.

               merlin steps back, grandiose and melodramatic.

                                     merlin
                         you are a snake about to strike!

               he raises his staff.

                                     merlin
                         and i am the staff that drives the 
                         snake back.

               he lowers the staff with dreamlike slowness and she slinks 
               right up to him.

                                     morgana
                         burning with the fire of desire, i 
                         am the flames that consume the staff 
                         to ashes.

               she winds her fluttering hands around the staff, and the 
               shadows they cast upon the tent give the illusion of licking 
               flames.

                                     merlin
                         i am the cloudburst that quenches 
                         the flames.

                                     morgana
                         i am the desert, where water 
                         disappears--

                                     merlin
                         --i am the sea, which covers the 
                         desert forever under its weight.

                                     morgana
                         --i am the fog and mists that rise 
                         up from the sea, escaping...

               she laughs at her cleverness.

                                     merlin
                         fog and mist! you couldn't be that. 
                         you don't have enough magic.
