               int. chapel - day

               a chorus of children sings. the bishop waits at the altar 
               with his friars and altar boys. cornucopias overflowing with 
               vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows 
               with the light of a thousand candles. sir kay is satisfied. 
               he comes back up the petal-strewn aisle.
