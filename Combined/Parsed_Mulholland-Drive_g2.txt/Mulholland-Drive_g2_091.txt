int. wilkins' apartment - a moment later
    
wilkins still in his pajamas, bathrobe and slippers from
morning slouches in an enormous stuffed chair and matching
ottoman, surrounded by piles of papers and coffee cups. his
jack russell terrier wakes and stands at the sound of the
phone ringing on a side table next to wilkins. wilkins comes
out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange, matted tufts of dirty blonde hair.
