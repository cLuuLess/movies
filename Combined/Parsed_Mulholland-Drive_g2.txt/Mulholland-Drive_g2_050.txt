payphone on red brick wall - day
    
we see the red brick building. it is denny's. betty and
rita are walking to the payphone. betty digs out some change
from her purse. she picks up the receiver, drops in a
quarter and dials the "0" for operator. an operator answers.
    
				betty
		hollywood police department please.
    
				operator
		is this an emergency?
    
				betty
		no, no, i just want the number.
    
				operator
		hold for the number.
    
betty gets the number for the hollywood police station, re-
deposits the quarter and dials.
    
				voice

		happened last night on mulholland drive.

done something bad and gotten away with it.
