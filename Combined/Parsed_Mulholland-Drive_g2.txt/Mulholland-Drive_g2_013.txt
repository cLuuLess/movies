ext. denny's
    
now herb waits for dan to lead the way.
    
				dan
		around here.
    
dan takes herb across the front of denny's to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back.
    
they begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone. dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building. red bricks glide by slowly.
    
closer on dan
    
beads of sweat cover his face. he finds it difficult to
breathe. herb is just behind him unable to see the fear
overtaking his friend, but herb can feel something himself.
    
the red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the
corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close.
    
suddenly a man - a face ... a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -
staring into dan's eyes.
    
dan lurches back. all his breath is suddenly gone. he falls
back into herb who tries to catch him as he's falling. dan
hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror.
    
herb looks up - the man is gone. he looks down to dan.
    
				herb
		dan! ... dan! you all right? ... dan!
    
he kneels down and studies his friend. he feels for a pulse
in the neck. he listens for breathing. his friend is dead.
    

    
				herb (cont'd)
		my god!
