int. - recording studio - day

we see what looks like a recording studio right out of the
1960's. we're looking through a plate of glass. a blonde
girl is standing at a vintage microphone. behind her are
three back-up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny
60's suits. we hear strings soar up and the blonde girl
begins to sing sixteen reasons by connie stevens. the male
vocalists backing her up flawlessly.

we move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound
stage. a screen test is being shot of the girl and as we
continue moving back we see the director adam kesher
surrounded by his crew. behind them there are many people
standing, eating, watching, working. the stage is full and
bustling. the song plays loudly over. sarah and nicki bring
betty into this scene through a giant stage door. a guard
mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. the
song continues to play over.

as sarah leads betty up close adam turns and his eyes fall on
the beautiful face of betty elms. sensing something betty
turns and sees adam. they each seem to feel the thrill of
the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than
they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the
song.

				adam
			(calling out through an
			electronic megaphone)
		cut it!
    
he gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the
blonde girl. he shakes her hand.
    
				adam (cont'd)
		thank you very much, carol. it was really
		great of you to come in. i know how busy
		you are.
    
				carol
		oh, man, are you kidding? i love this
		script! where do i sign?

    
				adam
		look... i love you, but there's no way
		they're gonna let me cast this thing
		until i've seen everyone. i'll let you
		know as soon as i can.
    
				carol
		i know you will ... cause my manager's
		gonna bug you day and night ... me too.
    
				adam
		it'll be my pleasure. now, get out of
		here.
    
				carol
		oh, you're just so cruel... don't forget
		me. i'm the girl that's going to play
		this part.
    
				adam
			(lightly pinching her cheek)
		see ya later.
    
adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor.
he looks around. he sees betty being introduced by sarah to
some of the studio executives. he goes over to his assistant
director and looks down at the man's notepad.
    
				adam (cont'd)
		who's next, hank?
    
				hank
		camilla rhodes.
    
adam wonders - worries.
    
				adam
		is she ready?
    
				hank
		all ready.
    
				adam
		bring her out.
    
hank speaks into his walkie-talkie headset. the sound of his
voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.
    
				hank
			(through walkie-talkie)
		camilla rhodes next!

    
adam looks up - a beautiful blonde steps into the set in
front of the microphone. it is the girl! the back-up
singers step in behind her.
    
adam nods to hank.
    
				hank (cont'd)
		turn over!
    
the cameraman calls out, "speed".
    
				adam
			(through megaphone)
		playback!
    
countdown before the music begins.
    
				adam (cont'd)
		action!
    
the strings soar up and camilla rhodes begins to sing.
    
on the set betty hears the song again and turns and watches.
once again her eyes find adam as his eyes are finding hers.
this time adam turns away. he watches camilla for a moment.
she is passable, but not spectacular. adam reaches out and
pulls hank over to him.
    
				hank
		yeah?
    
adam pauses.
    
				adam
		get jason over here.
    
hank gets on his walkie-talkie.
    
				hank
		cindy ... adam wants to see jason.
    
adam continues to watch camilla rhodes sing. jason goldwyn,
a tall sixty year old silver-haired man, comes through the
crowd and stops at adam's side. he looks down at adam, but
adam continues watching camilla rhodes. jason follows adam's
gaze and he watches camilla sing then turns back to adam.
adam slowly looks up right into jason's eyes - wondering how
much jason knows, but jason's face doesn't give away a thing.
    
				jason
		did you want to tell me something, adam?

    
				adam
		this is the girl!
    
at that moment ray, having overheard, comes to jason's side.
he smiles at adam.
    
				ray
		excellent choice, adam.
    
adam is sick with himself.
    
across the room betty panics when she looks at her watch.
    
				betty
		oh ... oh...i have to be somewhere. i
		promised a friend.
    
she quickly shakes sarah's and nicki's hands saying, "i'm
sorry, i'm sorry" and runs off like cinderella.
    
adam turns and sees her running off out of his world.
    
chris isaak's song "except the new girl" segues in over
connie stevens and plays as adam, sarah and nicki watch betty
disappear out the sound stage door.
