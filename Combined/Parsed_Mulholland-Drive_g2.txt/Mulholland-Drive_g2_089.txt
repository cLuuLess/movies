int. aunt ruth's apartment - later - day
    
panning slowly across we see on the bathroom counter various
open bottles, used q-tips, towels, combs, a brush, a bowl,
and lots of long strands of cut black hair. we continue
moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds. the
reflection of the new rita moves into the mirror. she has
short, beautiful blonde hair, blonde eyebrows and no make-up.
betty's reflection comes in beside rita's. they stare at the
new rita in the mirror.
    
				betty
			(quietly with assurance)
		you look like someone else.
