int. coco's apartment - day
    
on the move coco is just bringing her cigarette in its holder
up to her painted red lips. the phone is ringing and she's
crossing the room to answer it.
    
				coco
			(into phone)
		hello ... ruthie... how's the great up
		north? ... oh, i'm sorry to hear
		it ... what? well, i haven't seen her if
		she's in there. now, ruthie there's
		nothing to worry about. i saw betty last
		night and she was just fine. yes, and i

		will. i've got the production office
		number. i'll find you. now keep your

coco puts down the receiver with a long sigh.
