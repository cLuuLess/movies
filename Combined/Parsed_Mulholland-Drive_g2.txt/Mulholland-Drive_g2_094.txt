ext. roof garden - night
    
the girls race up the stone steps toward us. soon their wind-
blown, smiling faces fill the screen as they look out. there
before them are the lights of hollywood with silhouetted
palms, slow-moving theater kleig lights, and floating above
it all the giant sign in the hills reading hollywood.
    
				betty
		here i am hollywood! my name's betty.
    
a pause.
    
				betty (cont'd)
			(to rita)
		say it!
    
				rita
		here i am hollywood! my name is ... rita.
    
they look out, maybe waiting for an answer blowing in the
santa ana wind.
