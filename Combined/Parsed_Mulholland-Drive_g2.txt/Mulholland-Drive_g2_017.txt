ext. streets - los angeles - day
    
betty goes from the right side of the cab to the left side of
the cab looking at every building, tree and sign. each street
sign seems to be magical to her and she says the names to
herself as they pass by. she sees la tijera, la cienega,
venice boulevard, pico boulevard, olympic boulevard, wilshire
boulevard, etc., etc. until they reach fountain and turn
right. betty's heart is pounding when she sees havenhurst
and the cab turns left. in the middle of the block on the
right the cab pulls over and stops. betty sees her new
home ... an ancient, gorgeous courtyard apartment building,
built during the golden age of cinema.
