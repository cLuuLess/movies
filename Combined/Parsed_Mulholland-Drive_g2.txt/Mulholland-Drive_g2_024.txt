ext. - downtown los angeles - low rent office building - day
    
the street level of the office building is filthy and houses
stores selling racks of cheap toys. up above we see office
windows and a big sign saying "office space for rent" along
with a telephone number to call. we drift in toward one of
the windows on the sixth floor.
