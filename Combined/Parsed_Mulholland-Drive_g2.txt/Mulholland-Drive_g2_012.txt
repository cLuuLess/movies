int. denny's restaurant , hollywood - morning
    
two well-dressed men herb and dan (mid 30's) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee. herb has finished eating his
breakfast, but dan hasn't touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat. a blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying "diane" lays the check on their table
smiles, then walks off.
    
				herb
		why did you want to go to breakfast if
		you're not hungry?

				dan
		i just wanted to come here.

				herb
		to denny's? i wasn't going to say
		anything, but why denny's?
    
				dan
		this denny's.
    
				herb
		okay. why this denny's?
    
    
				dan
		it's kind of embarrassing but,
    
				herb
		go ahead.
    
				dan
		i had a dream about this place.
    
				herb
		oh boy.
    
				dan
		you see what i mean...
    
				herb
		okay, so you had a dream about this
		place. tell me.
    
				dan
		well ... it's the second one i've had, but
		they were both the same......they start
		out that i'm in here but it's not day or
		night. it's kinda half night, but it
		looks just like this except for the
		light, but i'm scared like i can't tell
		ya. of all people you're standing right
		over there by that counter. you're in
		both dreams and you're scared. i get
		even more frightened when i see how
		afraid you are and then i realize what it
		is - there's a man...in back of this
		place. he's the one ... he's the one
		that's doing it. i can see him through
		the wall. i can see his face and i hope
		i never see that face ever outside a
		dream.
    
herb stares at dan to see if he will continue. dan looks
around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
    
				dan (cont'd)
		that's it.
    
				herb
		so, you came to see if he's out there?

				dan
		to get rid of this god-awful feeling.
    
				herb
		right then.

    
herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay. dan just sits.
    
as herb is paying the bill he looks over at dan just as dan
is turning to look at him. from dan's point of view herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream.
herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with
the cashier. he motions for dan to follow him. dan rises
reluctantly and he and herb make their way outside.
