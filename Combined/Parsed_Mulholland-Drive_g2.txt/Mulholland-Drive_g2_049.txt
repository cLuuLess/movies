ext. hollywood residential street - day
    
betty and rita walk along. birds are chirping in the trees
which line both sides of the street. betty is smiling and
once again looking around at everything. her good mood and
excitement about life lifts rita's spirits.
    
coming toward them on the sidewalk are two people - a middle-
aged woman and a young boy around 10 years old. the boy is
very thin and something is wrong with him as he is walking
awkwardly on crutches. as the two groups pass each other on
the sidewalk betty is struck deeply by the boy's brilliant,
luminous blue eyes which are at once innocent and filled with
wisdom.

    
after they pass each other betty turns back and sees the boy
and the woman enter 1612 havenhurst. betty and rita continue
up the street.
