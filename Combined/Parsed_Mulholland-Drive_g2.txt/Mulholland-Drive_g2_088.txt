int. aunt ruth's apartment - bathroom - day
    
sounds, music churning continues.
    
great sobs, almost hysterical, wrack rita's body as she bends
over the sink, scissoring into her long, dark hair with a
frenzy. there is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair. betty's is rushing to her -
her hands reach tenderly, but firmly for rita's hand holding
the scissors. she keeps her from cutting and moves closer,
whispering in rita's ear. rita can't stop crying, but lets
betty hold her. music changes ...
    
				betty
		rita... i know what you're doing.
    
				rita
			(through uncontrollable sobs)
		what ... i..have... to do.
    
				betty
		i know what you have to do, but let me do
		it.
    
rita turns and looks up at betty, her eyes red with crying.
betty pulls her up facing her. rita lets betty take the
scissors. they look into each other's eyes. betty gently
strokes rita's cheek, wiping away some tears.

    
				betty (cont'd)
		let me do it.
