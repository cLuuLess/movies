ext. hollywood streets - early dawn
    
the clang of a metal gate wakes the woman. it is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open. the cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car. the red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate. the woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building. she sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage.

    
they leave the apartment door open. when the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat. their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door.
