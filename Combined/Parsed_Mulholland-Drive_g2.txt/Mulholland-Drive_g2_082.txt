int. cab - later
    
betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand.
she turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street.
    
				betty
		it should be around here...
    
rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
sierra bonita. they near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation. a smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex.
    
				betty (cont'd)
			(points)
		that's it ... 2590.
			(nudging rita)
		does it look familiar?
    
rita shakes her head..no. rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590. she discerns two men
sitting in the front.
    
				rita
		don't stop!
    
				betty
		what is it? what do you see?!
    
				rita
			(quietly - frantic)
		those men in front, in the car.
    
				betty
		do you know them?!
    
				rita
		no... but...
    
				betty
			(to driver)
		keep going. go around to the back.
