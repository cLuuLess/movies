int.   executive building - second floor - day
    
betty finishes climbing some stairs and crosses to the
receptionist. she hands over her pass. the receptionist
looks at it, hands it back to betty and points down the hall
to her left.
    
				receptionist
		number 43, on the left.
    
				betty
		thank you.
    
betty walks down the long corridor past several offices. the
door to office 43 is open when she arrives and she enters a
large sitting room with a receptionist at a desk off to one
side.
    
				receptionist
		may i help you?

    
				betty
		my name is betty elms. i'm here to
		audition for... mr. brown
    
				receptionist
		good. perfect timing. have a seat and
		i'll get mr. brown.
    
the receptionist stands, walks to a door, knocks twice, then
enters.
    
she closes the door behind her and betty is alone in the
sitting room. she sits on a couch and looks at the old
movie posters covering all four walls.
    
in a moment the same door opens again and an elderly,
distinguished looking gentleman wally brown comes out
smiling. betty stands up immediately.
    
				wally
		betty elms?
    
				betty
		yes.
    
				wally
		i'm wally brown. your aunt is a very dear
		friend of mine so it's particularly nice
		to meet you.
    
				betty
		very pleased to meet you.

				wally
		come in. i'd like you to meet everyone.
    
as they walk into wally's office...
    
				wally (cont'd)
		i took the liberty of inviting an extra
		person to see your audition. she saw
		your resume picture and was very
		interested in meeting you.
    
inside wally's office several people rise out of chairs when
wally enters with betty.
    
				wally (cont'd)
		betty elms this is jack taft, my
		assistant, jimmy katz who we've already
		cast for the part of "chuck". he'll be
		doing the scene with you.
		this is julie chadwick and bob brooker,
		the director, and our surprise guest is
		sarah james. we couldn't afford her to
		cast our picture, but as casting agents
		go she's the best.
    
				sarah james
		why thank you, wally. hello betty.
    
she and betty shake hands.
    
				betty
		pleased to meet you.
    
				sarah james
		this is nicki, my assistant.
    
nicki, a very stylish, thin girl with black cat-eyed glasses
nods coolly to betty.
    
				wally
		and this is martha, martha johnson, who
		you met out front.
    
betty nervously smiles to the room.
    
				betty
		hi.
    
				wally
		well. shall we get to it? would you like
		a water or a coffee before we begin?
    
betty's hands are beginning to sweat.
    
				betty
		no, no, i'm fine.
    
				wally
		well then, take a seat everyone. betty
		why don't you join jimmy and we'll play
		the scene. is there anything you'd like
		to say bob... something to betty before
		they begin?
    
betty stops on her way across to jimmy and looks to bob the
director.
    
				bob
		no ... it's not a contest, see, the two of
		them with themselves, so don't play it
		for real until it gets real.

    
betty doesn't know what to say. she catches sarah's
assistant, nicki, rolling her eyes.
    
				betty
		okay.
    
betty continues walking toward jimmy who opens his arms to
her as she approaches. he's old enough to be her father.
    
				jimmy
		just tell me where it hurts, baby.
    
				betty
		what?
    
				jimmy
		i want to play this one close, bob. like
		it was with that girl, what's her name,
		with the black hair. that felt good.
		whaddya think?
    
betty looks from jimmy to bob.
    
				bob
		that'd be good, jimmy. just don't rush
		that line again. i told you... the line
		where you say, "before what?"
    
				jimmy
		i was playin' off 'em. they say,
		"they'll arrest you"... and stuff like
		that.. "put you in jail"... they say it
		like that. they all say it the same way,
		so i react like that.
    
jimmy turns to betty.
    
				jimmy (cont'd)
		look ... what's your name?
    
				betty
		betty.
    
				jimmy
		yeah ... betty. you don't rush it. i
		don't rush it. we play it close, just
		like in the movies.
    
jimmy reaches out and puts his arm around betty and brings
her in against his pot belly.
    
				jimmy (cont'd)
		dad's best friend goes to work.

    
jimmy smiles as he brings betty a little closer. she is
trying to concentrate through the nervousness and jimmy's
breath. there is a silence as jimmy looks her in the eyes.
everyone in the room is looking betty in the eyes.
    
				wally
		bob?
    
				bob
		and ... action!
    
betty and jimmy start the scene. it is very difficult for
betty as jimmy has her in an absurd clench now.
    
				betty
		you're still here?
    
				jimmy
		i came back. i thought that's what you
		wanted.
    
jimmy plays this with a big lecherous smile. he gives the
last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear.
    
				betty
		nobody wants you here.
    
betty uses the anger of this line to push herself away from
jimmy. jimmy reaches out and grabs her wrist.
    
				jimmy
		really?
    
betty pulls her hand away and stands her ground.
    
				betty
		my parents are right upstairs! they
		think you've left.
    
jimmy smiles broadly and moves again toward betty.
    
				jimmy
		so ... surprise!
    
betty pushes him back.
    
				betty
		i can call them... i can call my dad.
    
				jimmy
		but you won't.

    
he grabs betty by the wrist again and pulls her in to him.
he puts his hand on her waist and it accidently slips and
keeps going down her hips. he jerks his hand back. betty
looks down and sees jimmy's hand hovering above her thigh.
betty takes her hand and gently presses down on jimmy's hand.
she slowly looks up with the most seductive smile. jimmy
lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh, and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile. with his other hand jimmy gently
pulls her closer. something has started coming over betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way.
she's surprising herself.
    
				betty
			(almost a hot whisper)
		you're playing a dangerous game here. if
		you're trying to blackmail me... it's not
		going to work.
    
jimmy now surprises himself. he becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off betty.
    
				jimmy
		you know what i want...it's not that
		difficult.
    
where the scene should turn to anger from betty it can't now
and betty plays it as she feels it. she stays in very close
to jimmy - looking him right in the eyes.
    
				betty
			(whispering desperately -
			slowly)
		get out... get out before i call my dad.
		he trusts you... you're his best friend.
			(her arms go around him)
		this will be the end of everything.
    
jimmy gets lost. he doesn't know where he is anymore. he
can only see betty's eyes.
    
				jimmy
		what about you? what will your dad think
		about you?
    
betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper... lost in heat.
    
				betty
		stop... just stop! that's what you said
		from the beginning. if i tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put
		you in jail, so get out of here before...
    
				jimmy
			(caught by her transfixing,
			sultry eyes, and almost
			breathless ... he finds himself
			taking an extra long pause)
		before what?
    
as scripted betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back, but wraps the knife around behind jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss.
    
				betty
			(as she kisses him - whispers)
		before i kill you.
    
jimmy panics and pushes betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance. he
finally is able to say his line.
    
				jimmy
		then they'd put you in jail.
    
as scripted betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because she's ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over. tears begin running down her
cheeks. she backs away.
    
				betty
		i hate you... i hate us both!
    
she pretends to drop the knife. the scene ends.
    
everyone in the room has become mesmerized by betty, but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance. sarah turns to nicki.
    
				sarah james
		i'm going to take her over there.
    
				nicki
		big time!
    
				wally
			(to everyone)
		wow!
    
betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself.
    
				betty
		well, there it was.

    
				jimmy
		there it was it was! baby, you got a
		way!
    
				wally
		bob?
    
				bob
		very good. really. i mean it was forced
		maybe but still humanistic. yeah, very
		good, really.
    
				wally
		well, thank you betty, and i mean that.
		that was very impressive. you've done
		your aunt proud and i'm going to tell her
		the first chance i get. we'll speak again
		soon i'm sure, and thank you so much for
		coming in.
    
				betty
		well, thank you.
    
betty doesn't quite know what to do. she moves to the center
of the room and just stands. remnants of the scene still
staying with her.
    
sarah stands and nicki stands just after.
    
				sarah james
		thank you, wally. i'm sure you all have a
		lot to talk about. we'll walk betty out.
    
				wally
		well, yes indeed. our pleasure, sarah,
		and don't you be a stranger. we'd love to
		see you around here again real soon.
    
				sarah james
		well come along, betty.
    
sarah takes betty's hand and they go to the door. betty turns
back once more and smiles.
    
				betty
		thank you again, mr. brown. it was nice
		meeting all of you.
    
everyone nods and waves and betty is taken out by sarah and
nicki.
