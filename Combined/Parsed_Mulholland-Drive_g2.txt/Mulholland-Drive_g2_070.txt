int. aunt ruth's apartment - day
    
betty and rita are sitting on the leather couch having some
coffee. the front door to the apartment is open and sunlight
is pouring in through the screen door. betty looks at her
watch.
    
				betty
		oh, no wonder i'm starving. i'm going to
		fix a sandwich. you want one?
    
				rita
		i'm all right.
    
				betty
		you've got to eat something. you're just
		nervous about going over to see if you're
		diane selwyn.
    
rita just looks at her. betty starts for the kitchen.
    
    
				betty (cont'd)
		suit yourself. i'll share mine with you
		if you change your mind.
    
betty goes into the kitchen. suddenly there's a knock on the
screen door and coco peers in, seeing rita on the couch.
rita looks up ... panicked.
    
				coco
		hi! who are you?
    
				rita
		uh...betty!?
    
betty comes out from the kitchen and sees the situation.
    
				coco
		can i see you outside a minute betty?
    
betty walks past rita, pats her on the shoulder and goes
outside to see coco who has moved away to wait.
