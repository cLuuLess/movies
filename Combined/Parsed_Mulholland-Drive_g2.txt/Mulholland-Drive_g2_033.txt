int.  mr. roque's office - day
    
mr. roque, in his wheelchair is still in the center of the
huge softly lit, windowless office. his manservant standing
silently behind him. the small built-in wheelchair phone
rings. mr. roque pushes a button on a small intricate remote
device he holds in his right hand. a slender streamlined
microphone rises from the arm of the chair.
    
				mr. roque
		yes?
    
he listens through a high-tech earplant which we now see.
    
				mr. roque (cont'd)
		thank you.
    
he pushes two buttons, one after another on the remote
device. we hear a small click, a dial tone, a number being
dialed, and a phone ringing.
