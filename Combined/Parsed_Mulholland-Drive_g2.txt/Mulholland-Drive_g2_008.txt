ext. hollywood streets - later - night
    
as if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street. a drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her. she runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building. the couple passes by without
noticing her. feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep.
