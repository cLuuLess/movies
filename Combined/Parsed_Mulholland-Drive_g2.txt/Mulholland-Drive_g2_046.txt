int. adam's kitchen - day
    
adam leaves the kitchen and goes out into the garage. he
turns on the light and looks around. he spots some paint
cans on a shelf and grabs one and goes back into the kitchen.
he can hear lorraine calling his name. she seems to be
coming closer. he sets the jewelry case and the paint can on
the floor, kneels down and opens the paint can with his car
key. just as lorraine enters the kitchen, he opens the
jewelry box and empties the 3/4 full gallon can of hot pink
paint into her jewelry case.
    
				lorraine
		what.. are ... you ... doing!!!???
    
he puts his hands into the paint and jewels and smushes them
about. lorraine rushes toward him.
    
				lorraine (cont'd)
		stop it!!!
    
lorraine grabs hold of him. starts pulling his hair,
slapping his face. she tears his jacket. adam stands all at
once and with his wet hot pink hands he pushes lorraine and
slams her into the kitchen counter just as gene the poolman
enters. gene grabs ahold of adam, cocks back and slams his
huge suntanned fist into adam's face.
    
				gene
		that's not a way to treat your wife,
		buddy. i don't care what she's done.
    
adam gets up off the floor bleeding from the nose and tries
to hit gene. gene blocks his punch and slams adam again,
knocking him down to the kitchen floor where he lands and
spills the jewelry case. adam, now covered with paint, is
picked up by gene and thrown out toward the front door.
    
				lorraine
		throw him out!
    
lorraine opens the front door while gene picks adam up, moves
him across the carpet and heaves him out onto the front lawn.
lorraine slams the door behind him.
    
adam picks himself up, severely dazed and bleeding pretty
badly, he heads for his car.

    
taka stops gardening and smiles and bows at adam as he gets
into his car.
    
adam drives away - pink paint and red blood all over.
