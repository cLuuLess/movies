int. hollywood police station - day
    
detective neal domgaard throws two wallets down on the desk
in front of detective harry mcknight. harry pauses in the
middle of a large bite of grilled cheese sandwich with bacon
and tomato. he looks down and studies the wallets.
    
				detective harry mcknight
			(biting in and chewing)
		nice wallets.
    
				detective neal domgaard
		handstitched italian. filled with phony
		credit cards ... off the two guys in the
		caddy.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		the one of 'em still alive?
    
				detective neal domgaard
		yeah... just .... dr. scott's got 'im. you
		remember dr.scott.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		oh yeah.

    
				detective neal domgaard
		well he said...  you know in his way... you
		know what i mean? besides the guy
		gettin' rolled up under the kids car
		which busted him up pretty bad, there was
		this little knife-like torn piece of
		metal, you know, off the car body, rolled
		out and slid up through this guy's neck
		and just kinda slit his aorta, you know,
		but they didn't find it right away, so
		the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you
		know, to the brain - all this time cause
		it was just like this thin little
		puncture wound on the surface of his neck
		that kinda sealed itself, he said, while
		inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty
		steady all that time. so, dr. scott's
		laughin' you know like he does 'cause he
		knows we want to talk to this guy. he's
		laughin' you know and shakin'... son of a
		bitch couldn't stop laughin'... it was
		kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we
		were all laughin'...the nurse was
		laughin'. you know how he is.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		find out who they are?
    
				detective neal domgaard
		nope, not yet. their fingerprints don't
		match up anywhere.
    
				detective harry mcknight
			(another big bite - chewing)
		interesting.
    
				detective neal domgaard
		yeah ... and they both use the same
		address.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		where at?
    
				detective neal domgaard
		palmdale.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		damn, that's a long drive.
