int. apartment  living room
    
betty enters, thrilled with what she sees. the apartment is
filled with movie memorabilia, deco furniture, oriental rugs,
brass floor lamps and a massive tiled fireplace. she sets her
bags down and stares.
    
				betty
		it's unbelievable!
    
				coco
		i told ya.
    
				betty
		wow!
    
				coco
		now i guess you and your aunt have an
		understanding. so here's the key and you
		need anything, just give a holler.
			(coco hands betty the key)
		everybody in this building's pretty much
		okay with me or they wouldn't be here.
		if you want, later i'll introduce you
		around. no hard feelings if you don't,
		and don't forget the rooftop garden.
		it's just up the stairs we passed. it's
		open to all the tenants. you can see the
		hollywood sign from there.
    
				betty
		oh coco thank you. thank you so much.

				coco
		you got it! see you later honey.
    
coco leaves and closes the door behind her. betty begins to
explore the apartment.- after walking a circle in the living
room she passes through the kitchen. she moves down a
hallway looking at paintings and posters. she goes into the
bedroom. she smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge
ornately carved head and foot board. she notices the soiled
dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. she
stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has
all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling
tiles. as she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in
the mirror above it. suddenly something catches her eye and
she opens the shower stall. there before her is the naked,
beautiful dark-haired woman.
    
				betty
		oh my!
    
she quickly closes the shower door.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		i'm sorry. my aunt ... ruth didn't tell
		me someone was going to be here. i'm so
		sorry.
    
				dark-haired woman
		that's okay.
    
				betty
		i'm ruth's niece. my name's betty. i'm
		sure she told you i was coming.
    
there's a silence.
    
				dark-haired woman
		there was an accident. i came here.

				betty
		i understand. i saw the dress. i...i'm
		sorry.   are you all right?

    
there is another silence.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		what happened?
    
				dark-haired woman
		a car ... a car accident.
    
				betty
		are you okay?
    
				dark-haired woman
		i think so. i was just taking a shower.
    
				betty
		oh my god. i'm sorry. i'll let you get
		back to that. i'm going to get unpacked.
    
betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she
stops and looks back in.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		what's your name?
    
we see a close-up of the dark-haired woman. we see her eyes
widen with a kind of fear. she's frantically thinking -
searching her mind for an answer.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		i'm sorry. i'll get out of here and we
		can talk later.
