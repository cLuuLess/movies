ext. adam's house - bel air
    
adam pulls into his driveway, but is blocked from entering
the garage by a poolman's truck. he gets out of the car and
looks at the truck - sees the insignia on the door which is a
blue square with the word "gene" above and the word "clean"
below. adam hears steps behind him and turns. a japanese
gardener is coming toward him smiling and bowing.
    
				japanese gardener
		ah, mister ... you remember me. i am taka.
		your gardener. for long time i not see
		you. i pleased to see you.
    
taka reaches out his hand and adam shakes it.
    
				adam
		hello taka. it's 'cause i'm never home
		in the day time. it's good to see you
		again. the garden looks great.
    
taka bows, smiling and nodding, and goes back to work. adam
heads toward the front door of his house.
