int. cab - day
    
betty reaches and gently grabs rita's shoulder. she speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver won't hear.

    
				betty
		why didn't you ask him? sol knows you!
    
				rita
			(whispering back)
		but i don't know, sol. i never heard of
		sol. i'd just get in trouble. that's why
		we shouldn't go see about diane
		selwyn... it's better not to get in
		trouble.
    
				betty
		you're not going to get in trouble.
		you're going to find out who you are.
		finding out who you are gets you out of
		trouble.
    
rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again.
