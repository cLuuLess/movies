ext.  mulholland drive   - night
    
police, paramedics surround the wreckage. two detectives,
harry mcknight and neal domgaard (both mid 40's to 50), stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights. a coroner's van pulls out just after an
ambulance. the ambulance's siren begins to wail as it speeds
off. the coroner's van cruises slowly. detective harry
mcknight and detective neal domgaard continue staring. they
do not look at each other. they are each motionless for a
long moment.
  
				detective harry mcknight
		you feel it?
    
				detective neal domgaard
		yeah.
    
they continue to stare.
    
 
				detective neal domgaard
		sammy thinks the caddy had stopped along
		the shoulder ... man up the road said he
		saw two cars drag racin'...then you got
		that blind corner.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		two men... two guns in the caddy.
    
				detective neal domgaard
		the boys found this on the floor in back
		of the caddy.
    
neal holds up a plastic bag holding a pearl earring.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		yeah, they showed me
    
				detective neal domgaard
		could be unrelated.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		could be...any of those dead kids wearin'
		pearl earrings?
    
				detective neal domgaard
		no. could be someone's missin' maybe.
    
				detective harry mcknight
		that's what i'm thinkin'.
    
detective harry mcknight turns and crosses mulholland. his
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond. he slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of hollywood laying far below like a galaxy.
he looks out and wonders.
