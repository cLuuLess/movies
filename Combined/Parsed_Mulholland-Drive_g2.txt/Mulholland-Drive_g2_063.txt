int. beverly hills hotel - corridor outside room 214
    
a hotel manager is walking toward the door of room 214. he
knocks softly on the door. the door opens and adam kesher is
standing there - still beaten looking with remnants of pink
paint.
    
				adam
		yes...what is it?
    
				hotel manager
		i'm sorry mr. kesher, but there seems to
		be some problem concerning your credit
		card.
    
				adam
		... what??
    
				hotel manager
		the fact is mr. kesher a representative
		of your bank called us.
    
				adam
		how...  how'd they know i was here?
    
				hotel manager
		i don't know. all we do is take an
		impression of the credit card and until
		you check out it just sits in our files.
    
				adam
		so, what did they say?
    
				hotel manager
		well, sir, i'm afraid they said you're
		overdrawn at your bank and your line of
		credit has been cancelled.
    
				adam
		unbelievable. look... here.
			(adam taking out his wallet.)
		i don't know what's going on.
		that's so much baloney. i've got enough
		cash for one night, okay?
    
				hotel manager
		that's fine, mr. kesher. you can pay
		cash when you check out. i'm sorry. it
		was my duty to inform you.
    
				adam
		fine. i'll check out in the morning.

				hotel manager
		have a good evening, mr. kesher.
    
the hotel manager turns to leave and adam closes the door.
