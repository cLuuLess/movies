ext.  night - hollywood hills, los angeles
    
darkness. distant sounds of freeway traffic. then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an eucalyptus tree. then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit. the words on the sign
read... "mulholland drive." the car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness.
