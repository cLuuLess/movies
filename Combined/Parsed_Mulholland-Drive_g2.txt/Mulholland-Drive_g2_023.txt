int. apartment bedroom
    
the bathroom door opens and the dark-haired woman comes out
wrapped in a towel. she's drying her hair with another. she
and betty stare at one another.
    
				dark-haired woman
		my name is rita.
    
				betty
		hi...do you work with my aunt?
    
				rita
		no ..........i.

				betty
		i...i mean......i...it's none of my
		business.

				rita
		she has pretty red hair... she is very
		kind i think.
    
				betty
		she sure is. she's letting me stay here
		while she's working on a movie that's
		being made in canada, but i guess you
		know that.  i couldn't afford a place
		like this in a million years. unless of
		course i'm discovered and become a movie
		star. of course, i'd rather be known as
		a great actress than a movie star, but
		sometimes people end up being both and
		that is, i guess you'd say, sort of why i
		came here. i'm sorry, i'm just so
		excited to be here..i mean i just came
		here from iowa and now i'm in this dream
		place. you can imagine how i feel.
    
				rita
		i think i've been hurt.
    
				betty
		oh...
    
betty goes to rita.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		sit down...
    
betty sits rita on the bed. she leans down and looks at her
head and face.
    
    
				betty (cont'd)
		where were you hurt?
    
rita motions to her head above her forehead. betty looks
through her hair and finds her wound which has stopped
bleeding but is surrounded by a very large blue black
bruising.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		we should get a doctor.
    
				rita
		no.
    
				betty
		but, this could be serious.

				rita
		no...i need to sleep.
    
				betty
		if you have a concussion you shouldn't
		sleep.
    
				rita
		it will be okay if i sleep. i need to
		lie down and sleep.

				betty
		all right, but...i'm going to check on
		you.
    
rita lies down and is instantly asleep. betty leans over her
and listens to her breathing. she gets a blanket and drapes
it over the beautiful sleeping rita, then leaves the room.
