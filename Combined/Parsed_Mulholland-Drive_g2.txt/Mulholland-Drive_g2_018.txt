ext. 1612 havenhurst
    
the cab driver puts betty's bags down on the sidewalk next to
her. she can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away.
betty picks up her bags and enters, as if in a dream, through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center. a sign on a door to her right reads
manager and she rings the bell.

    
an older, once very beautiful, woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door.
an unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door.
    
				manager
		hi there...ten bucks says you're betty.

				betty
		i am, mrs. lanois. it is mrs. lanois
		isn't it?
    
				mrs. lanois
		in all my living glory, baby.
    
				betty
		pleased to meet you.
    
				mrs. lanois
		you can call me coco ... everybody does.
		stay there, i'll get the key.
    
				betty
		okay, coco.
    
coco returns with the key and opens the screen door inhaling
a huge drag off her cigarette. she starts off into the
courtyard and betty picks up her bags and follows. as coco
speaks smoke comes out of her with every word.
    
				coco
		i guess it was your grandfather, was
		it ... he called me to check in, said you
		were on your way and for you to call when
		you get in. nice man... farmer i hear.
    
				betty
		yes, he is. he raises corn.
    
				coco
		damn lot of corn raised in hollywood
		these days too.
    
				betty
		well, i ...
    
				coco
		you don't have to tell me. it's written
		all over that pretty face of yours.. you
		came here to be an actress. i just hope
		you'll remember there's never been a
		great poem called "tits and ass."
    
    
				betty
		i...
    
				coco
		you probably don't remember her, but
		louise bonner lives right over there in
		number 29. when she isn't drunk she runs
		a damn good acting class.
    
				betty
		have many famous actors and actresses
		lived here? i was meaning to ask you
		that.
    
				coco
		honey, all the great ones came through
		here at one time or another.
    
a haunting music begins to swell.
    
				coco (cont'd)
    
		people say in the springtime when the
		wind blows the smell of the jasmine you
		can still feel the presence of everyone
		of them.
    
				betty
		i guess i've come to quite a place.
    
				coco
		sweetheart, you don't know the half of
		it.
    
the music fades.
    
coco looks down suddenly. on the cobblestone courtyard in
front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog.
she angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
    
				coco (cont'd)
			(yelling up)
		wilkins! ... (no answer) ... that dog craps
		once more out here and i'll bake his
		butt for breakfast!!
    
coco turns back to betty.
    
				coco (cont'd)
		you don't have pets do you?

    
				betty
		no, i don't.
    
				coco
		that's good. they're allowed, but i
		don't like 'em...for obvious reasons.
		one man used to live here that had a
		prize fighting kangaroo. you wouldn't
		believe what that kangaroo did to this
		courtyard ... let's see your aunt's
		apartment ... it's a good one.
    
				betty
		i can hardly wait, coco.
