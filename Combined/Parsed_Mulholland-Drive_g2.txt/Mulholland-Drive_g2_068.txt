int.  aunt ruth's apartment. - morning
    
we see rita's face as we hear betty off screen.
    
				betty
		"you're still here?"
    
				rita
		"i came back. i thought that's what you
		wanted."
    
we see betty.
    
				betty
			(angrily)
		"nobody wants you here!"
    
moving back we realize that the girls are acting out betty's
audition scene. rita is reading her lines.
    
				rita
		"really?"
    
				betty
		"my parents are right upstairs! they
		think you've left..."
    
				rita
		"so... surprise"...
    
				betty
		"i can call them... i can call my dad... "
    
				rita
		"but you won't..."

    
				betty
		"you're playing a dangerous game here.
		if you're trying to blackmail me... it's
		not going to work."
    
				rita
		"you know what i want...it's not that
		difficult."
    
				betty
			(furious)
		"get out! get out before i call my
		dad ... he trusts you ... your his best
		friend. this will be the end of
		everything... "
    
				rita
		"what about you? what will your dad
		think about you?"
    
				betty
		"stop! just stop! that's what you said
		from the beginning. if i tell what
		happened... they'll arrest you and put you
		in jail, so get out of here before..."
    
				rita
		"before what?"
    
betty pulls a table knife out from behind her back.
    
				betty
		"before i kill you."

				rita
		"then they'd put you in jail."
    
betty mimes with moving fingers tears flowing from her eyes.
    
				betty
		cry, cry, cry, and then i say with big
		emotion, "i hate you... i hate us both!"
    
betty drops the kitchen knife and both girls start laughing.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		such a lame scene.
    
				rita
		but you are really good.
    
betty mimes tapping a cigarette in a cigarette holder ala
dietrich.

    
				betty
		thank you dahling!
