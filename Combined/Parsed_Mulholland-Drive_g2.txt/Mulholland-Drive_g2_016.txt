an older gentleman has joined the old lady. they stop at the
taxicab stand. the old lady takes the blonde girl's hand.

to betty and takes irene off. betty smiles after them.

find she is next in line and her cab is waiting. she turns
once more and waves at irene as her bags are loaded into the
trunk of the cab.
