int. lax airport
    
a blonde girl walking with an old woman approaches us. as the
blonde's face fills the screen we move with her and stay with
her as she goes. her face is bright and her eyes move here
and there taking in everything. she can hardly believe she's
in los angeles - the city of dreams. she and the old woman
pass under a sign which reads "welcome to los angeles."
the girl smiles and looks around excited by every detail.
