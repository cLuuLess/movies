ext. -  courtyard 1612 havenhurst - day

    
betty is coming out of aunt ruth's apartment. she calls
back in to rita.
    
				betty
		i hope i'm back in a couple of hours.
		don't drink all the coke.
			(we hear laughter from inside
			and rita call out.)
    
				rita
		good luck!
    
				betty
		when i get back i'll have the cab
		waiting, so be ready to go.

				rita
		okay.
    
betty closes the door and heads across the courtyard. she
knocks on coco's door and in a moment coco answers.
    
				betty
		sorry to trouble you, coco.
    
				coco
		it's all right gorgeous. something
		wrong?
    
				betty
		no, no. i'm on my way to my audition.
		before i go i wanted to ask you if you
		could remember the man's name ... aunt
		ruthie's friend who helped put this
		together. it completely went out of my
		mind.
    
				coco
		his name's wally brown .... great guy.
		been in the business since forever.
    
				betty
		thanks coco. it'd be so embarrassing
    
				coco
		naw! he wouldn't have cared. just give
		him a good performance and he'll be happy
		and i've got a feeling you'll do just
		that.
    
				betty
		thanks coco. i'll let you know.

    
				coco
		get going. you don't want to be late.
    
				betty
		right. see ya.
    
				coco
		good luck, honey!
    
betty takes off through the iron gates and coco smiles as she
watches her go.
