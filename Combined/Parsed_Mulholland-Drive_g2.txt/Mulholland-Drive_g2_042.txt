int . aunt ruth's apartment - day
    
the girls are still sitting on the leather couch as before,
but now silently off in their own worlds. after a moment...
    
				betty
		i wonder where you were going.
    
betty's question hangs in the air. slowly we move close to
rita who is on the verge of remembering something.

    
suddenly -
    
				rita
		mulholland drive.
    
				betty
		mulholland drive?
    
				rita
		that's where i was going... mulholland
		drive.
    
				betty
		maybe that's where the accident was.
		there must be a police report. we could
		call.
    
				rita
		no.... i don't...
    
				betty
		we could call anonymously from a pay
		phone... just to see if there was an
		accident.
    
rita sits worrying.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		come on. it'll be just like in the
		movies. we'll pretend to be someone
		else. i want to walk around anyway. i'm
		in hollywood and i haven't even seen any
		of it. come on rita. do you feel up to
		it?
    
				rita
		okay... but just...just to see.

				betty
		just to see if there was an accident on
		mulholland drive.
    
				rita
			(tentatively)
		okay.
    
				betty
		come on... let's find you something to
		wear.

aunt ruth's bedroom - day
    
betty laughs as she holds one of ruth's dresses in front of
rita.
    
				betty
		it's terrible ... my aunt dresses like miss
		marple.
			(off a blank stare from rita )
		she's kind of a frumpy woman detective in
		british movies.
    
rita laughs along with betty. betty goes back in the closet.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		here's something okay.
    
she brings out a pair of khaki pants.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		try these on. you can wear one of my t-
		shirts with it and it won't look bad with
		those sandals.
