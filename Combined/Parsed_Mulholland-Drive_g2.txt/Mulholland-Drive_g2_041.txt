int. - aunt ruth's apartment - day
    
we pull back from rita's face until we see that betty and
rita are sitting on the leather couch about four feet apart
staring at the floor. they just sit this way for awhile.
    
				betty
		well...  what do you think about then? i
		mean...  well what do you think about?
    
				rita
		what do you mean?
    
				betty
		well ... if you don't remember anything, i
		mean what goes through your mind then if
		you don't remember anything?
    
				rita
		nothing. i do remember the car crash... i
		told you... i remember the glass ... i
		think about that sometimes ... i remember
		walking here, sort of. now i remember
		this place and you. that's about it.
    
				betty
		how do you remember how to talk?

    
				rita
		i don't know.
    
				betty
		you don't remember anything else?
    
				rita
		no
			(she covers her eyes with her
			hands)
		there is something...something there i
		can't tell... i can't describe it.
			(struggling to figure it out -
			to express it)
		there are things there.... but i'm... here.
    
betty thinks about what rita has said. somehow it seems to
make sense to her.
    
				betty
		the money. you don't know where it came
		from?
    
				rita
		unh, unh.
    
				betty
		when you think about them... the
		money... the key ... does it make you
		remember anything?
    
silence.
    
				rita
		the money... i don't know about the
		money... the key... it makes me feel ...
		afraid.

beverly hills city streets - day
    
a car - a late model generic sedan is moving toward us. two
men dressed in suits and wearing dark glasses are driving
slowly. as they go each man is scanning sidewalks,
buildings, passing cars as if hunting for someone. they pass
by us and as we turn we leave them and pick-up adam driving
in the opposite direction in the other lane. we stay with
adam.
    
adam drives his porsche up a palm lined street.

    
				adam
		office...
    
the voice activated phone connects the line to adam's office.
a secretary answers.
    
				secretary
		adam kesher's office.
    
				adam
		it's me. where's cynthia?
    
				secretary
		she's on the set. i'll connect you mr.
		kesher.
    
another ringing sound, then a voice.
    
				voice
		stage one.
    
				secretary
		paul, i have mr. kesher for cynthia.
    
				paul
		right baby, all hell's broke loose down
		here. i'll try to find her.
    
adam listens to dead silence for a moment or two then cynthia
speaks.
    
				cynthia
		adam, where are you?
    
				adam
		what's going on, cynthia?
    
				cynthia
		they've closed the set. they sent
		everybody home.
    
				adam
		what did you say?
    
				cynthia
		they fired everyone.
    
				adam
		who fired everyone?

    
				cynthia
			(starting to cry)
		ray did ... and then they closed the
		set.... everybody's gone. you'd better
		get down here adam!
    
				adam
		no.
    
				cynthia

		fix this.

		to do something ... you've got to do
		something adam!
