int. black cadillac limousine - night
    
two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat. a
beautiful, younger, dark-haired woman sits in back. she sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness.
she seems to be thinking about something. suddenly she turns
and looks ahead. the car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road.
    
				dark-haired woman
		what are you doing? you don't stop
		here ...
    
the car stops - half on, half off the road at a dark, blind
curve. both men turn to the woman.
