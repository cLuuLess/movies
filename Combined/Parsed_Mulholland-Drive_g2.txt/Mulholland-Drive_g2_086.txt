int. - bungalow #17 - day
    
betty and rita are moving down the corridor. they pass a
small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make-up
table. they move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed. betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own. they enter the room and stop cold. a scream
starts to build inside rita. before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed. great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. a dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. the
scream comes out of rita as a force propelling her to look
closer. betty lunges after rita, her eyes also not able to
leave the sight. she covers rita's mouth with her hand and
brings her close. the scream is stifled by betty's hand.
    
in the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. betty
freezes and keeps rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth, but she can't stop rita's violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes.
