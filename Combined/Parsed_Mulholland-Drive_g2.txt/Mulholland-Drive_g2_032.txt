int. - ext. apartment - day
    
betty rinses her dishes in the kitchen sink and pours herself
a cup of coffee. she takes the coffee outside to the
courtyard - to a white metal table just outside her doorway.
she sits down and stretches in the warm afternoon sun.
across the way she can hear a blues saxophonist practicing in
one of the apartments. she drinks her coffee and listens to
the music.
    
some birds fly by overhead. she takes another sip of coffee.
the blues music which was mellow and slow is now building in
tempo and volume. the phone inside rings. betty takes her
coffee back into the living room, shutting the door behind
her. she crosses to the leather couch and picks up the
phone.
    
    
				betty (cont'd)
		hello ... aunt ruth!! i can't tell you how
		happy i am. your place is so fantastic!
		yes ... coco...what a character. i really
		like her... that's too bad...waiting in an
		airport must not be too fun. what's a
		mosquito plane? ... oh i get it. how long
		does that take from montreal? ... well,
		you'll sleep good tonight ... hudson bay
		sounds beautiful ...oh well, i hope you
		packed your coat. (laughs). you mean
		the audition...wally brown... she didn't
		mention it but he'll fax the dialogue to
		coco? suddenly i'm so nervous ... okay
		aunt ruth... i'll try. i'll study those
		lines until i know them inside out.
		yes, either right here on this fabulous
		leather couch or i'll take them with a
		coffee in the courtyard like a regular
		movie star. (laughs). oh! i got a real
		shock to find your friend rita here. she
		was in the shower and i opened the
		door ... rita ... what do you mean? she was
		in an accident ... your friend rita. no,
		coco unlocked the door. no, she didn't
		see her. she's sleeping. no... she's
		very nice. i'm sure there's some
		explanation, aunt ruth... i don't think we
		have to do that. please don't worry.
		i'll take care of it. no, i'll let you
		know. where can i ... okay i'll get it
		from coco.
		no, please don't worry... thank you so
		much for letting me stay here. you've
		made me so happy... thank you, thank you.
		please don't worry... aunt ruth we don't
		need the police. i'll call you when you
		get to hudson bay. please...
		please ... goodbye aunt ruth.
    
betty slowly and quietly hangs up the phone. she sits for a
moment listening. silently she stands and moves toward the
bedroom. as she approaches the bedroom door she stops at
something she sees. rita is sitting on the edge of the bed
crying quietly. betty goes into the bedroom. rita looks up
at her with desperation.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		you're awake... i think i misunderstood
		you. i thought you knew my aunt and
		that's why you were here. i just talked
		to my aunt on the phone and she wants me
		to call the police.

    
rita starts crying harder, bows down, covering her face with
her hands.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		rita?
    
				rita
			(crying harder)
		i'm... sorry. i ...

betty's heart softens.
    
				betty
		what is it rita?
    
				rita
			(still sobbing)
		i'm...i'm... oh no... i thought when i woke
		up... i thought sleep would do it ...
    
betty kneels down in front of her.
    
				betty
		what's wrong?
    
				rita
			(crying)
		i don't know who i am.
    
				betty
		what do you mean? you're rita.
    
				rita
			(crying)
		i'm not. i don't know what my name is.
		i don't know who i am!!
    
betty looks down at the purse next to rita's dress. she picks
it up and hands it to rita.
    
				betty
		this is your purse. your name must be in
		your purse.
    
rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation. she hesitates.
something is worrying her. she looks at betty for help.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		you want to know don't you?
    
				rita
		i ... yes, but ... i ...

    
				betty
		open it!
    
rita slowly unzips the purse. the pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be $125,000.00 cash in hundred dollar bills.
    
both rita and betty almost stop breathing. they look at each
other, then back to the money.
    
rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed. she reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse ... a blue key. betty
sees rita's expression change to a kind of horror.
(note: this blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key.)

interior - office building - day
    
ray crosses a carpeted closed area. he mounts a flight of
stairs. at the top of the stairs there's a plain blonde wood
door. ray punches in a code on a security panel next to it.
the door opens automatically. ray passes through and goes
down a narrow hall. at the end of the hall there is a small
elevator. again ray punches in a code. the elevator opens and
ray goes in. the elevator door closes, but the elevator does
not move. ray waits. finally, a woman's voice comes through a
speaker.
    
				woman's voice
		who is it please?
    
				ray
		raymond harris ... 20743.
    
the elevator begins to move up. when it stops, the door opens
and ray walks into a windowless reception area where a
beautiful italian woman sits behind a large, blonde, modern,
built-in desk.
    
				receptionist
			(very quietly)
		you may go right in, ray.
    
ray crosses to a blonde wood double door and waits. the
receptionist pushes a button behind her desk - chimes sound
as the double doors open to an enormous office with no
windows. heavy rich brown curtains line the walls.
    
    
ray enters and the doors close behind him. ray takes a few
steps forward, then stops. there is a solid glass wall that
we now notice running the width of the office. cut into the
glass wall is a small speaker microphone apparatus. beyond
the glass off in the center of the room is a man sitting in a
very plain, blonde, wood, modern, yet not motorized,
wheelchair. the man is paralyzed except for his right hand
and head. his head appears small in relation to the size of
his body. his suit is immaculate and one of the finest we've
ever seen. his manservant stands in the shadows behind him.
    
				ray
		good afternoon mr. roque. (pronounced
		rowk).
    
mr. roque stares at ray silently.
    
				ray (cont'd)
		do you want him replaced?
    
mr. roque continues to stare.
    
				ray
		i know they said...
    
				mr. roque
		then?
    
				ray
		then... i guess it's so .... alright, but
		that means we should ...
    
				mr. roque
		yes?
    
				ray
		shut everything down ... is that something
		that...do you want us to shut everything
		down?
    
silence. ray doesn't know what to do. he struggles to
interpret mr. roque's silence. he waits. mr. roque does
nothing but stare.
    
				ray (cont'd)
		then we'll shut everything down.
    
silence.
    
ray turns. the doors open as he approaches them and he
leaves the room. the doors close.

vincenzo and luigi are staring silently and without
expression at the broken windshield of the limousine. the
limousine driver suddenly starts signaling to a car entering
the driveway to the building. he turns to the castigliane
brothers.
    
				limo driver
		the other car is here sirs. please allow
		me.
    
the limo driver opens the rear door of the new limo, then
hurries around and opens the other rear door. the new driver
gets out of the car.
    
				limo driver (cont'd)
		here's the key to the car. take it
		straight to the garage. they're waiting
		for you.
    
the limo driver closes both back doors after the castigliane
brothers are seated within. he then gets in himself and
maneuvers the big limo out into traffic.

pink's chili dogs - day
    
two guys, joe ( the guy who killed ed in the sixth floor
office) and billy another unkept, rocker type delivery man
are standing waiting for their chili dogs with a girl, laney,
who could be very good looking but she seems to be in poor
health. her hair is long and stringy. she's wearing a
tight, short sleeve blue sweater, black jeans and boots.
    
				billy
		yeah, sure. look what happened to them.

				joe
		no, no, no, i told you. they're fine.
		they're all real happy.

				billy
		my next delivery is up that way, so i'll
		be getting down to it real soon.
    

				joe
		you're so easy.
    
				billy
		gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
    
				joe
		yeah, what for?
    
				billy
		keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's
		all.
    
the chili dogs arrive and they pay for them.
    
				billy (cont'd)
		can we eat in the van?
    
				joe
		what's  the matter now?
    
				billy
		nothing... i don't like being out in the
		open like this.
    
				joe
		it must be just so pathetic being you.
		sure billy, grab your dog we'll eat in
		the van.
    
the three make their way to the van. joe looks over at
laney.
    
				joe (cont'd)
		you sure you don't want anything?
    
				laney
			(hesitantly)
		not here...no thanks.
    
				joe
		not a coke or anything?
    
				laney
		no ... thanks though... i'll take a
		cigarette if you have one.
    
				joe
		sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
    
as laney is getting her cigarette and lighting it..

    
				joe (cont'd)
		any new girls on the street these days?
    
				laney
			(taking her first big drag)
		no.  i haven't seen any.
    
				joe
		a brunette? ... maybe beat up?
    
				laney
		no...
    
				joe
		you'll keep your eyes open for me won't
		you baby?
    
				laney
		sure.
    
joe spanks her butt as she gets in the van.
    
				joe
		you bet you will.
