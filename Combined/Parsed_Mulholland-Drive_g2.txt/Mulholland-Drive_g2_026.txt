int. conference room - century city building - day
    
we see three men sitting at a conference table raymond(ray)
hott -president of production, wearing a crisp blue
suit,vincent darby -senior vice-president, wearing a crisp
green suit and robert smith -talent manager, wearing a crisp
brown suit. ray and mr. darby sit at the head of the table
and robert smith sits along the side. a younger man -adam
kesher enters and sits down, with an arrogant nonchalance,
next to robert smith. adam is dressed in a frumpy old
fashioned plaid shirt, worn jacket, dark blue cotton slacks,
and a pair of old brown wing tips. as he sits he is holding
and twirling a vintage "7-iron" golf club.
    
				adam
		so what's the problem?
    
				ray
		there is no problem.
    
				adam
		so why did you idiots bring me
		here? ... i'm in the middle of making a
		picture.
    
silence for a moment. a man enters through a rear door and
whispers something to mr. darby and shows him something on a
piece of paper. mr. darby studies the piece of paper.
    
				mr. darby
			(to man who entered)
		what was it last time?
    
the man who entered points to something on the paper.
    
				mr. darby (cont'd)
		okay, let's try the next one.
    
the man nods and leaves.
    
				ray
		he isn't gonna like it.
    
				mr. darby
		we'll see.
    
				adam
		hello ... who're we talkin' about here?
    
robert smith shuffles nervously in his chair next to adam.

    
				robert smith
		you see adam... there are some suggestions
		which are to be brought forward ... and i
		know you said you would entertain
		suggestions and that's all anybody here
		is asking you to do.
    
				adam
		what're you talking about?
    
				robert smith
		an open mind ... you're in the process of
		re-casting your lead actress and
		i'm... (looks around) we're asking you to
		keep an open mind.
