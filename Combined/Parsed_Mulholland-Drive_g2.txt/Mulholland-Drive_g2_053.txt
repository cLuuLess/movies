aunt ruth's apartment - moments later
    
betty and rita are sitting next to each other on the leather
couch. betty is rifling through the phone book. she finds
the listings for selwyn. her finger drifts down and finds d.
selwyn followed by an address and phone number. it is the
only selwyn with a d. first name. she hands the phone to
rita.
    
				betty
		strange to be calling yourself.
    
				rita
		maybe it's not me.
    
				betty
		call the number.
    
betty reads the number off and rita pushes the corresponding
buttons. each tone seems to be louder than the last. the
ringing seems deafening. there's a click and the phone is
answered - by a machine. a woman's voice is heard - loudly.
    
				woman's voice
			(coming from answering machine)
		hi ... this is me. leave me a message.
    
betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also -
straining to hear everything. the machine starts recording.
betty hangs up the phone immediately.
    
				rita
		it's not my voice ... but i know her.
    
				betty
		maybe the voice isn't diane selwyn.
		maybe that's your roommate or if it is
		diane selwyn she can tell you who you
		are.
    
				rita
		maybe...maybe ... maybe.
