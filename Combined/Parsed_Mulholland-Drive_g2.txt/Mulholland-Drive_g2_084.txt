int. - bungalow #17 - day
    
betty begins to go through the bungalow and rita follows.
all the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn. they move
slowly, looking around at everything as they go. betty looks
to rita to see if any of this is something she remembers.
rita looks as though she's walking in a trance. through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor.
