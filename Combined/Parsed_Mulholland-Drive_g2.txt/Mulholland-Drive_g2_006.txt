ext. hollywood hills - later - night
    
the woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants. sirens can be heard in the distance. she
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her. she screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense. the coyote backs away -
snarling. the woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off. she falls to the ground. we can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. she gets
up and stumbles through the trees. when she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of los angeles glowing down
below. she clumsily starts down toward it.

hollywood streets - later - night
    
the woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
franklin avenue. a car races by and its headlights flare on
her face. her expression shows fear and panic. she doesn't
know where she is or where to go. she runs frantically across
the street. she moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area.
