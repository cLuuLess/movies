int. aunt ruth's apartment
    
betty and rita both turn with alarm. betty gets up, stares
at the door, then at rita. rita waits, not knowing what to
do.
    
				betty
		it'll be okay.
    
betty opens the door. betty finds the face of the actress,
louise bonner, staring questioningly at her.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		yes? may i help you?
    
				louise
		where is ruth?
    
				betty
		ruth's gone on a film. i'm her niece
		betty.   who are you?

				louise
		someone is in trouble. who are you? why
		are you in ruth's apartment?

    
				betty
		i'm her niece. she's letting me stay
		here. my name is betty.
    
				louise
		no it isn't. that's not it. that's not
		what she said. something bad's happening.
		where's ruth?
    
				betty
		i'm sorry, but i don't know who you are
		and i'm...

				coco
		louise... what're are you doing louise?
    
louise turns and sees coco approaching across the courtyard.
    
				louise
		where have you been coco? god, i've been
		trying to find you all afternoon since
		3:00 o'clock. that one is in my room and
		she won't leave. i want you to get her
		out. i want you to get her out now.
    
coco comes up and grabs hold of louise. she turns over to
betty.
    
				coco
		this is louise bonner. i'm sure she
		meant well.
			(looking over to louise)
		this is betty, ruth's niece. in fact and
		fortunately i was just coming to see
		betty. betty's a young actress and i'm
		delivering faxed pages of a scene for her
		audition tomorrow. here they are honey.
		now come along louise and i'll take you
		home.
			(back to betty)
		sorry about this. sometimes it happens.
    
				louise
		no, she said it was someone else in
		trouble.
    
				coco
		stop it, louise. let's get you
		home ... goodnight betty.
    
coco takes louise back through the darkness of the courtyard.
betty closes the door and turns.
    
    
				betty
		whoa!
    
she catches rita's look. rita is staring at her, horrified.
