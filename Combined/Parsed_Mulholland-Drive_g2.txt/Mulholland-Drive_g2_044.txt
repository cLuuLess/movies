int. - adam's house - day
    
adam enters, puts his 7-iron in his golf bag just inside the
door, then looks around. he can see the pool through a wall
of plate glass windows, but there is no one visible poolside.
    
				adam
			(calling out)
		lorraine...
			(then louder)
		lorraine ... you home?
    
he hears a noise, something falling. he walks in the
direction of the noise. it leads him to his bedroom. his
expression darkens as he approaches the closed door. he
hears voices as he throws the door open.
    
lorraine and the poolman gene are in bed.
    
				lorraine
		now, you've done it!
    
				gene
		just forget you ever saw it. it's better
		that way.
    
				lorraine
		what the hell are you even doing here?
    
adam stands stunned for a moment. then finds himself walking
over to the dresser and opening the top drawer. he removes a
large case.
    
				lorraine (cont'd)
		what are you doing?
    
adam starts walking out of the bedroom with the case.
    
				lorraine (cont'd)
		that's my jewelry!!!
    
adam leaves the bedroom and starts through the house. he
goes into the kitchen and looks around - numb but trying to
think.
