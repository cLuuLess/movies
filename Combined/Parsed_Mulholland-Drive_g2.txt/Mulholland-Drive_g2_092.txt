int. aunt ruth's apartment - bedroom - night
    
rita has just taken the hatbox from the closet shelf and is
setting it on the bed.
    
				betty
		what are you doing?
    
betty is sitting on the bed opposite. rita opens the hatbox
and removes her purse. she opens the purse and takes out the
money. she sits down on the bed and while staring at the
money she thinks of what to say.
    
				rita
		you've been so good to me ... now we know
		why ... why i was so afraid. we know what
		kind of trouble i'm in. i shouldn't...
		ask you... i only have this to offer.
		i'll give you this if i can stay here for
		awhile. i don't know what else to do.
    
betty moves across the bed to the side of rita. she puts her
arm around rita and holds her.
    
				betty
		rita... i want you to stay here and you
		don't have to give me that money.
    
				rita
		but i want to.
    
				betty
		no. we shouldn't touch that money. we
		don't know about that money. that might
		be dangerous money. you have to start all
		over again. you look like a brand new
		person and you can be a brand new
		person... whoever you want to be.
    
				rita
		it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody
		brand new.
    
				betty
		hey, let's introduce the brand new you to
		hollywood. we haven't seen the roof
		garden yet.
