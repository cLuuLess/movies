int. room  214 - night
    
adam crosses the room to the phone and dials a number. the
phone is answered.
    
				adam
		someone's shut off my money!
    
				cynthia
		i know.  where are you adam?

				adam
		what do you mean "you know"?
    
				cynthia
		someone called me. when they couldn't
		get you they told me you were as good as
		broke. i didn't believe then, so i made
		some calls.
    
				adam
		and?
    
				cynthia
		you're broke!
    
				adam
		but i'm not broke.
    
				cynthia
		i know, but you're broke. where are you?
    
				adam
		beverly hills hotel. i've got enough
		cash in my pocket for one night.

    
				cynthia

		cowboy?
    
				adam
		the cowboy??
    
				cynthia
		yeah, the cowboy. this guy, the cowboy,
		wants to see you. jason said he thought
		it would be a good idea.
    
				adam
		oh, jason thought it would be a good idea
		for me to meet the cowboy. should i wear
		my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
    
				cynthia
		something tells me this guy is connected
		with what's happening, adam, and i think
		you should do it and i think you should
		do it right away.
    
				adam
		cynthia...what's going on?

				cynthia
		it's been a very strange day.
    
				adam
		and getting stranger. where do i meet
		this cowboy? i mean do i have to ride
		out to the range?
    
				cynthia
		sort of, funny boy. if i tell him the
		meeting's on you're to go to the top of
		beachwood canyon. there's a corral up
		there where he'll be.
    
				adam
		you gotta be kidding?
    
				cynthia
		will you meet with him?
    
				adam
		yeah, sure. it is that kind of a day.
		when?

				cynthia
		i'll call him, then call you back...if
		you want you could stay at my place.
    

				adam
		cynthia... that would not be a good idea.

				cynthia
		i'm just offering a place to stay.
    
				adam
		i understand, cynthia and thank you for
		the offer. i'll find a place. now go
		ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get
		back to me.
    
				cynthia
		okay, but you don't know what you're
		missing.
    
				adam
		git along little dowgie and call me back.
    
adam hangs up and seems to sag, cupping his forehead and eyes
with his hand.
