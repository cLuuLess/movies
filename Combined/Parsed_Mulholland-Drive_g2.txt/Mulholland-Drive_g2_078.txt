int.- corridor executive building - day
    
the three of them walk down the corridor.
    
				sarah james
		oh god, that was awful!
    
betty's head spins to sarah. a look of shock and let down on
her face.
    
				sarah james (cont'd)
		oh, not you betty. you were stellar and
		i mean that, but poor wally. he'll never
		get that picture made. wally's days were
		up twenty -years ago.
    
				nicki
			(sickening little laugh)
		how about that jimmy katz?
    
				sarah james
		oh god! jimmy katz never had a day.
		jimmy katz never had a minute. poor
		wally.
    
betty finds herself getting a little upset.
    
				betty
		they seem very nice to me, and
		wally... mr. brown is a very close friend
		of my aunt's, so. . .
    
				sarah james
		settle down, betty. don't get me wrong.
		i love wally. i ought to. i was married
		to him for ten years.
    
betty does another shocked head turn.
    
				sarah james (cont'd)
		and i love actors, all actors, jimmy katz
		included. we just get a little catty
		sometimes. now we want to take you across
		the way and introduce you to a director
		who's a head above the rest. he's got a
		project that you would kill!
    
at the word 'kill' betty turns to her once again with a
questioning look.

    
				sarah james (cont'd)
		... knock it right out of the park.
