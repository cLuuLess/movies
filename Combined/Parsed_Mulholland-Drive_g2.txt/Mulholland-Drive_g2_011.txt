int. apartment - early dawn
    
the woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains. she goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen. she listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard. she hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk. she hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard. she hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment. she
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen. remaining
frozen, the dark-haired woman's eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her, grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter, then leaves the apartment. the woman can
hear the door being locked. she lets go, slides to the
kitchen floor, and passes out.
