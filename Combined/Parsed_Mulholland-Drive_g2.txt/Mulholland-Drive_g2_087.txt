ext. bungalow #17 - day
    
the middle-aged woman backs away from the front door, looking
around at bungalow #17. she's not sure if she has heard
something or not. she wonders, then turns and goes back to
her bungalow.
    
just as she has disappeared the door to bungalow #17 flies
open and rita, followed closely behind by betty, runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen.
    
sounds, churning music.
