ext. - havenhurst - day
    
betty and rita are walking back to the apartment. we see
them from a distance. they are talking and gesturing in an
excited and animated way. just after they enter through the
iron gates of 1612 havenhurst and are out of sight we notice
a car moving slowly up havenhurst toward us. we notice two
men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for
something.
