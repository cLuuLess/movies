ext. courtyard 1612 havenhurst - day
    
the screen door slams. coco and betty face each other close,
out of earshot of rita.
    
				coco
		your aunt called me.
    
				betty
		i was afraid of that.
    
				coco
		she wants to know who's staying in her
		apartment.
    
				betty
			(slowly, deliberately)
		it's just for a night or two, until she
		finds her own place. i tried to explain
		that to aunt ruth, but the connection was
		bad and her plane was leaving and she got
		it all mixed up. i kept telling her it
		was my friend and she kept saying she
		didn't know any ritas ...
    
				coco
		sweetie, look at me straight.
    
betty lifts her eyes to coco's. direct, clear.

    
				betty
		coco...she's very nice. we went to
		school together.
    
				coco
		so i guess your grandpa and grandma know
		her.
    
				betty
		not really. i met her in junior college
		and she was from this other town.
    
coco looks hard into betty's innocent face.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		you can call my grandparents ... i'm sure
		they'd tell you that i don't lie and i
		sure wouldn't allow a stranger to invade
		my aunt ruth's apartment.
    
				coco
		honey... i was married to a director for
		thirty years. he had an uncanny ability
		to read people. maybe some of it rubbed
		off on me or maybe i had it all
		along ... you're a good kid... what you're
		telling me is a load of horse - pucky but
		it comes from a good place. i'll trust
		you to sort this out. now i'm not going
		against ruth. she's got enough to worry
		about up there in canada. if she asks-
		i'm going to say everything is okay, and
		you make sure it is.
			(coco places her hand on
			betty's shoulder and squeezes
			it)
		if you need any help you know where to
		find me.
    
betty puts her hand on coco's shoulder and gives her a
squeeze.
    
				betty
		you're really something coco...thank you.

				coco
		don't make me out to be a sucker. louise
		bonner says there's trouble in there.
		you remember last night. sometimes she's
		wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid
		of it.

    
coco turns and walks away. betty studies her and thinks
about what she said before turning and going back inside.
