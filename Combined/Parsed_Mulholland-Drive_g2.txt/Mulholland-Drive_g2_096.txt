we drift along the red bricks past the payphone, along the
wall until we come to the corner. slowly we round the corner
and move to a dark alley. there amongst the dumpsters and
trash cans is the dark silhouette of a figure. we move closer
to the figure. it is the bum and the bum sits. we move
closer and the bum's face fills the screen. it's face is
black with fungus. it's eyes turn and they seem to be red.
