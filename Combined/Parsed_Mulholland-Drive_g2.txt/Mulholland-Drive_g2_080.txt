an idling cab sits waiting with back door open.

courtyard - 1612 havenhurst day
    
chris isaak song segues to the sounds of a blues saxophone.
    
betty and rita come out of aunt ruth's apartment. betty is
laughing, pulling on rita.
    
				betty
		c'mom. there's nothing to be afraid of.
    
across the courtyard cornell dumont, a strikingly handsome
young black musician, is on his balcony playing the
saxophone. he stops playing when he sees the girls. he
stands and looks as if recognizing someone.

    
				cornell dumont
		hey!

    
betty and rita stop and look up, shielding their eyes from
the sun.
    
				cornell dumont (cont'd)
		hey, how's sol?
    
				betty
		sol?
    
				cornell dumont
		no ... not you...
			(to rita)
		i'm sorry... i forget your name.
    
				rita
			(almost inaudible)
		rita.
    
				cornell dumont
		yeah. well, i haven't seen sol lately.
		tell him to come by the club.
    
rita nods ... biting her lip. cornell smiles and picks up his
sax.
    
				betty
		and what's your name?
    
				cornell dumont
			(big smile)
		cornell dumont.
    
he begins to blow some sweet jazz that flows smooth as syrup.
    
				betty
			(whispering)
		ask him who sol is ...
    
rita hurriedly starts for the gate.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		maybe he could help...
    
betty follows rita through the gate to the waiting cab. they
get in and the cab pulls away.
