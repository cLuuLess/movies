ext.  further up mulholland drive - night
    
two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
cadillac limousine. the cars are filled with crazed
teenagers. two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back.
    

    
the cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
mulholland drive.
