int.  aunt ruth's bedroom - day
    
rita is now dressed to go out and is studying herself in a
mirror. she turns and her gaze falls to her purse. she
picks it up and looks questioningly at betty.
    
				betty (cont'd)
		no ... you shouldn't take that. let's hide
		it.
    
they look around the room... there's a hatbox in the closet
above the clothes rack. betty brings it down, takes out the
hat, and rita puts the purse inside. betty puts the hat over
the purse in the hatbox and puts in back in the closet.
betty puts out her hand. rita looks at it for a moment,
smiles, and they shake.
