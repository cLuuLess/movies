int. aunt ruth's apartment - later day
    
betty is stretched out on the big leather couch in the living
room. a half eaten sandwich and chips are on a plate on the
coffee table next to her. she is talking on the phone.

    
				betty

		it's more beautiful than i ever
		dreamed ... no she left me a lot of food.
		the refrigerator's full ... aunt ruthie
		said she'd call me when she got

		seat to a boy with a broken leg. she was
		so nice to me. she invited me to her
		house sometime. it's in bel air which is
		a place where people have a lot of
		money... i will. everybody's telling me

		here ... yeah, it's long distance. i love
		you. say hello to grams. give her a big
		kiss for me. okay, i love you
		grandpa ... bye.
    
betty hangs up the phone, takes a big bite of her sandwich
and lays flat out on the couch, chewing and smiling up at the
ceiling. she suddenly remembers rita and her promise to look
in on her. she gets off the couch and goes into the bedroom.
