91   ext. practice range - day                                   91

     lots of the big names are there.   romeo is like a kid at
     the ballpark.

                             romeo
               look! right there! fred
               couples... and ray floyd!

     romeo notices that tin cup is staring at the pile of
     practice balls lying there on the tee.

                             tin cup
               look at these balls. brand new
               titleists. lookit 'em, every one
               a brand new titleist.
                      (lowers his voice)
               sneak a few in the bag when you
               get a chance. we swipe enough
               free shit we might even pay for
               this fiasco.

     tin cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real
     legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful
     shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.

                             romeo
               you think it would be
               inappropriate to ask ray floyd for
               an autograph?

                             tin cup
               i think it's a dead giveaway,
               romes... but if i still got the
               shanks we're gonna be found out
               real fast...

     tin cup nudges a ball from the pile into address
     position. romeo hands him a different club.

                             romeo
               hit the seven iron. you never
               miss the seven...

                                                            92.

                         tin cup
           good thought, pods...

tin cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses...

                         tin cup
           dollar bills...

and he swings.

thwock! a hideous shank squirrels across line, almost
hitting a group of u.s. open officials. heads turn.

                         tin cup
                  (to anyone who'll
                   listen)
           who hit that shot? anybody see?

he addresses another one.   and swings.

thwock!   a disaster.   he crumbles.

                         romeo
           a little thin, boss.

                         tin cup
           a little fucking thin?! i still
           got the shanks! everybody's
           watching! christ, simms is here...

simms has arrived and is watching tin cup with delight as
he loosens up.

                         romeo
           maybe we should work on putting.
           ya can't shank a putt.

tin cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball.

                         tin cup
           if you're the mexican mac o'grady,
           romes, you gotta figure out why
           i'm still shanking the ball.
                  (beat)
           what's the problem? i'm catching
           it on the hosel, right? moving my
           head? i'm laying off it, i'm
           pronating, i'm supinating, i'm
           clearing too early, i'm clearing
           too late, i'm off plane, i ain't
           dropping in -- oh, god, my swing
           feels like an unfolding lawn chair.

                         romeo
           you got a virus in your brain.   i

                                                     93.
          got to kill the brain to kill the
          virus.

                         tin cup
          anything.   kill me now!

                        romeo
          put all your change in your right
          pocket.

tin cup follows orders, not questioning the logic.

                        romeo
          very good. now tie your left
          shoelace in a double knot.

again, tin cup dutifully follows orders.

                        romeo
          esta bueno. now, turn your hat
          around backwards and put a blue
          tee behind your right ear...

                        tin cup
          i'll look like a fool.

                        romeo
          what you think you look like
          hitting those squirrelly chili
          peppers up freddy couples' ass,
          eh? do what i say or i quit.

                          tin cup
          okay, okay...

                        romeo
          perfect... now hit a seven iron
          into that tree over there. you're
          ready.

tin cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees.

                        tin cup
          how'd i do that?

                         romeo
          you ain't thinking about shanking,
          you ain't thinking about the
          doctor lady, you ain't thinking
          period. you just lookin' like a
          fool and hittin' it pure -- your
          natural state.

                          tin cup
          fuck you.

                                                                94.
                             romeo
               you cured.

                             tin cup
               that's it?

                            romeo
               that's it. your brain was getting
               in the way.

                             tin cup
               that's rarely been a problem.
               what now?

                              romeo
               well, i should recommend you go
               work on your short game but i
               think it's better if you go get
               drunk instead.

                             tin cup
               get drunk?

                              romeo
               yeah. you always play better when
               you're wasted.

     tin cups stares at the swami, and --

                                                    cut to:
