     he drops his clubs on the couch. the place is a wreck,
     and he collapses in a chair, cracking a can of cheap
     beer.

     a knock at the door.   he's startled.

                             tin cup
               debt collection? process server?

                                                           51.
          ex-flame? jesus, i'm clean.
                 (disguises his
                  voice)
          who is it?

the door opens -- molly enters. he's surprised but well-
settled into his bath of cynicism.

                        molly
          god, you've got a beautiful
          swing --

                        tin cup
          -- and big, beautiful green eyes
          -- i'm a beautiful guy.

                        molly
          i came here to apologize.

                          tin cup
          for what?

                         molly
          well, i counseled you, you did
          exactly what i said, and i just...
          poured cold water over your
          effort.
                  (quickly)
          i didn't get it. i'm a terrible
          shrink, probably... i should've
          never got out of real estate --
          actually i should never have
          left ohio for that cowboy in
          armarillo -- have you ever been
          to amarillo?

                          tin cup
          a cowboy?

                        molly
          it's not as romantic when you're
          actually with one -- a wrangler,
          y'know -- so of course the oil
          man in dallas looked great after
          that -- i don't know what i was
          thinking... that's when i went to
          the gulf and ended up in, well,
          trailer sales and then all those
          condos in corpus christi -- the
          bottom fell outta the market and
          i needed a new gig --

                          tin cup
          a new gig?

                          molly
          therapy.    i took all the classes.

                                                            52.
           i'm licensed, y'know.
                  (suddenly dejected)
           oh god...
                  (reaching into her
                   purse)
           mind if i smoke?
                  (lights up)
           anyway, i'm flattered you asked me
           out. i can't accept because i am
           involved with david and i haven't
           seen any evidence that he treats
           old people, kids or dogs badly.

                         tin cup
           i got a little carried away, i
           guess. i shoulda just layed up,
           made my par, and moved on.

                         molly
           look, i want to propose something
           -- as long as you understand this
           is professional -- we're not going
           out together --

                          tin cup
           tee it up.

                         molly
           i can help you with the mental
           aspects of the game. you've got
           romeo to be your swing doctor, i
           can be your head doctor.

                         tin cup
           but you said you were a lousy shrink?

                         molly
           well, yeah... i'll improve.

                         tin cup
           i got no money to pay for you.

                         molly
           i'll trade my services for golf
           lessons and help you through the
           qualifying. if you get into the
           open, well, you're on your own.

                         tin cup
           you'll be with david.

                          molly
           yeah...

silence.   a deal.   it's the best they can do.

                                                  cut to:

                                                               53.
