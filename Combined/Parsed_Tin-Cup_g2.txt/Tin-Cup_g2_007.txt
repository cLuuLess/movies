9   int. golden tassel - night                                     9

    a nearly-naked dancer on stage to a lot of whooping
    cowboys. tin cup moves in this world with ease and
    something that passes for grace. everyone knows him.


                            waitress/stripper
              hey, tin cup, haven't seen ya in
              three days!

                                                                 15.

                             tin cup
               busy man, courtenay, busy man --

     as they pass the stage, even the naked dancer interrupts
     her moment with a bunch of guys offering dollar bills --

                                naked dancer
               tin cup!     hi, sweetie!

                             tin cup
               hiya, honey -- lookin' sweet...

     and backstage they go, easily waved through by another
     bouncer. they come up to a dressing room door. and
     knock.

     a voice from inside.

                             voice (o.s.)
               that better be you, roy.


10   tin cup and romeo                                           10

     enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity. and
     there she is -- doreen, 35, at least, the classic chesty,
     hippie, big-wigged texas goddess. she's older than the
     other girls, and more experienced in every way. she's
     smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her
     stripper's outfit.

     tin cup and romeo stand at her beckoning.

                                tin cup
               doreen...

                             romeo
               you're looking particularly
               lovely this evening -- this is
               nicer than the leopard suit --

                             doreen
               cut the horseshit, guys. so...
               the one and two dogs always run
               wide and the three dog always
               breaks slow, so i figure there's
               gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at
               the turn and the three dog's
               gonna tiptoe around it and walk
               on home... i was right.
                      (smiles)
               you owe me twelve thousand
               dollars.

                             romeo
               we going to pay you.

                                                              16.

tin cup squirms as doreen babbles a bit.

                        doreen
          i know you're going to pay me.

                        doreen (cont'd)
                 (admiring her own
                  outfit)
          y'know i finally got rid of the
          leopard suit thing -- it was so
          retro, y'know... it's not easy
          being a post-modern stripper...
                 (beat)
          so... twelve big ones?

tin cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces
some official-looking papers. he hands them to her.

                        tin cup
          there. with equity and inventory
          it's worth twelve grand... more or
          less.

doreen leans forward to examine the papers.    she looks at
tin cup with surprise.

                         doreen
          this is how you think you can
          settle up? by deeding me your
          driving range?

                        tin cup
          only on condition you don't sell
          right away, and me'n romeo keep
          our jobs.

                        doreen
          what in the world would i want
          with your stupid driving range?

                        tin cup
          equity, inventory, cash flow...
          not to mention an enhanced stature
          in the community, and prepaid
          membership in the salome chamber
          of commerce.

for a moment, doreen can only stare dumbly at tin cup,
caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. then
she starts to consider the idea more seriously.

                        doreen
          what are your labor costs?
                 (off no response
                  from tin cup)
          payroll, roy. what do you pay

                                                                17.
               your help?

                             tin cup
               let's see... the tractor kid gets
               five bucks an hour. romeo, he
               gets ten cash --

                             doreen
               what do you pay yourself?

                                tin cup
               myself?

     doreen nods in a way tin cup finds threatening.

                             doreen
               to hit golf balls all day... when
               you're not breaking for beers or
               corn dogs or to gather the guys
               and lay bets on which crow flies
               off the fence next.

                             tin cup
               you're referring to my managerial
               salary?

                             doreen
               i'm referring to every nickel you
               snatch out of the till and every
               bag of beer nuts you lift from the
               rack, is what i'm referring to.
                      (beat)
               i'll say it's worth ten and you
               still owe me two.

     she smiles, he sighs.

                                                    cut to:
