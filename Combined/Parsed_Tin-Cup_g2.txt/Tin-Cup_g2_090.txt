132   ext. fifth hole - day                                      132

      tin cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree.
      he surveys his options. behind him, wearing a headset,
      mccord analyzes the situation for the tv viewers.

                                                                  120.
                              mccord
                this is definite jail. this is
                life without parole. his only
                chance to stage a jail-break is go
                at the ball left-handed and hope
                he can somehow snake it back into
                the fairway, and save par from
                there.

      tin cup glares balefully back at mccord. then he walks
      over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green
      from it. he walks back for his ball, turns to mccord...
      and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in tin cup's
      eyes.

                              tin cup
                fifty bucks says i knock it on...
                with a seven iron.

      and he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed,
      and:

      he swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and...

      ... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and...

      ... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and
      trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin.

      the gallery goes crazy as tin cup steps from the woods
      collecting his money from mccord while jabbing a taunting
      finger at simms.
