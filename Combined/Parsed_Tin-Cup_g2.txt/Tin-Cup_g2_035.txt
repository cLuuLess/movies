53   ext. cottonwood local qualifier - tenth tee - day           53

     tin cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself,
     in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind.

     molly and romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging,
     tin cup's on a roll and needs no help. so far...

     a couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.

                             clint/earl
               you the man, tin cup! you the
               man!

                             romeo
               they bugging you, boss -- i can
               shut 'em up?

                             tin cup
               the way i'm swinging today,

                                                          56.
          nothing bugs me -- except
          insufficient applause.
                 (surveying the
                  fairway)
          gimme the lumber.

but romeo is handing him a two iron.

                        romeo
          i think two iron's safer.

                        tin cup
          i said i want the big dog.

romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg
left par five.

                        romeo
          tight par five, out of bounds
          left... you don't want to hit
          driver.

                        tin cup
          i'm not going left of those trees.
          i'm going over those trees... with
          a little draw. that way i get
          home in two. that way i'm putting
          for eagle.

                        romeo
          you don't need eagle to qualify!
          you need to get used to playing
          smart -- no mistakes wins the
          open.

                       tin cup
          qualify? i want the course
          record! now gimme the lumber!

tin cup reaches for the driver.   romeo shifts the golf
bag beyond tin cup's reach.

                        romeo
          you not going to listen to me?
          you don't care i'm trying to help?
          you think i'm full of shit?

                        tin cup
          i think i'm gonna get penalized
          for slow play if you don't give me
          that fucking driver.

                        romeo
          you a head case, boss, always
          were, always will be.

                                                              57.
                        tin cup
          then let's ask the head doctor.
          dr. griswold?
                 (to molly)
          dr. griswold, should i hit the big
          dog or the two?

suddenly an official steps forward.

                        p.g.a. official
          soliciting shot selection advice
          is a two-stroke penalty.

                        molly
          trust your feelings, roy.

                         tin cup
                  (to romeo)
          ha!   gimme the driver and shut up.

romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over
his knee. he tosses the two halves on the ground near
tin cup.

                          romeo
          ... go ahead.    hit the driver.

tin cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing
his anger, not giving romeo the satisfaction of a
reaction.

                        tin cup
          i changed my mind. gimme the
          three wood.

                        romeo
          you can't clear the dogleg with a
          three wood.

                          tin cup
          wanna bet?

romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it     over his knee,
and tosses the halves on the ground next     to the driver
halves. tin cup turns with amusement to      his playing
partners, lest they think management has     lost the upper
hand with labor.

                        tin cup
          guess i'm going with the safe
          shot, boys.

tin cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment,
frowns, and then:

he snaps it over his knee. he dumps these halves on the
ground with the halves of the driver and three wood.

                                                              58.
romeo stares, aghast.   tin cup merely shrugs.

                        tin cup
          sometimes i fan that two iron.
          better gimme the three.

romeo warily hands tin cup the three iron.    tin cup looks
at it, frowns, then:

he snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground.

molly leans over to the regulars.

                        molly
          is this normal behavior for him?

                        earl
          the word 'normal' and him don't
          collide in the same sentence too
          often.

she watches in amazement as --

                         tin cup
          sometimes i catch that three a
          little thin...

he drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and
steps past romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag.

he snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.

                         tin cup
          and i've hooked my four iron...
                  (snap)
          ... and hit flyers with the
          five...
                  (snap)
          ... and shanked the six...
                  (snap)
          ... and skulled the eight...
                  (snap)
          ... and fatted the nine...
                  (snap)
          ... and chili-dipped the wedge...
                  (snap)
          ... and bladed the sand wedge...
                  (snap; then pauses
                   to reflect
                   contemptuously
                   on his putter)
          ... and then there's mister
          three-putt...

he snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of

                                                                59.
     broken clubs at his feet.

     then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven
     iron. the regulars hold their breath, thinking this is
     the end of tin cup's open bid. but...

     tin cup smiles and caresses the seven iron
     affectionately.

                             tin cup
               but the seven iron, i never miss
               the seven iron. it's the only
               truly safe club in my bag.

     he moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the
     middle with the seven iron.

                             tin cup
               you happy, romeo?

                             romeo
               no, boss, i'm tired... my life's
               too short to spend it watching you
               fall apart. i done it too many
               times.

     romeo turns and starts walking away.

                             tin cup
               what's this? you're quitting?
               first sign of adversity, you're
               quitting?
                      (as romeo
                       continues)
               anyone want to bet me i can't par
               in with a seven iron?
                      (to molly)
               doc? take the bet?

                             molly
               roy -- just shut up and hit the
               ball.

     tin cup's magic with a seven iron.   he drives with a
     seven iron.


55   he chips with a seven iron.                                55


56   he blasts out of sand with an open-bladed seven iron.      56
