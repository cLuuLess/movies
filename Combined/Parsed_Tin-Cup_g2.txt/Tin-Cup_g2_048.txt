82   int. winnebago - morning                                      82

     tin cup stands there caught, like a deer in the
     headlights, like a man caught cross dressing, a private
     confession made public -- he can't run and he can't
     hide...

     roy "tin cup" mcavoy is wearing every gimmick that molly
     first arrived with -- plus many more. he wears a
     pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious
     triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his
     elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow
     attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he
     swings a collapsible club... and a beginners golf video
     projects loudly from his vcr, so loudly that he never
     heard her knocking.

                                molly
               my god...

                                tin cup
               aarghh...

                                molly
               roy...

                             tin cup
               dr. griswold...

     a moment of pathetic silence, then:

     molly starts laughing -- he is destroyed.

                             tin cup
               the therapist laughs at her
               patient? is that how it works? a
               man is laid bare before god and
               he's the butt of the cosmic joke?

                             molly
               i'm sorry, i just...

                             tin cup
               some of this shit might actually

                                                           84.
          work, y'know... i mean i think
          there's something to this hat
          with the pendulum golf ball
          thing... may be on to something
          here...

                        molly
          oh, roy, jesus... quoting yourself,
          'it is the paraphernalia for lost
          and desperate souls.'

tin cup lets down. the wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness.

                         tin cup
          well, god damn... a lost and
          desperate soul stands before you.
                  (beat)
          i assume i have the
          confidentiality of doctor-client
          privilege in regards to this
          outfit?

                        molly
          of course you do. what happened?

                        tin cup
          i got the shanks.

                        molly
          are you taking penicillin?

                        tin cup
          it can't be treated! it's much
          worse than whatever you thought it
          was.
                 (beat)
          there's a glitch in my swing.

                        molly
          so it's in romeo's department?

                        tin cup
          he thinks it's your department --
          says it's a head thing.

                        molly
          oh. well. i just came over to
          congratulate you on the regionals
          and return your car -- david says
          he doesn't want it, just wanted to
          make a point with you --
                 (beat)
          but i suppose we could have a
          therapy session right here and now
          --

                                                         85.
                        tin cup
          i don't want therapy. i want you.

                         molly
          roy...   i gotta get some air --

                        tin cup
          look at me --
                 (considering what
                  that means)
          well, not right at the moment --
          but listen to me. you're with the
          wrong guy. i'm the right guy.
          everyone tells me my face is all
          screwed up tight as a drum 'cause
          i've been crazy about you from
          the day you showed up wearing
          this stupid stuff and the whole
          damn thing has both inspired
          me to get here on the verge of
          greatness yet it's also caused
          me to get the shanks which
          could humiliate me in front of
          a zillion people.
                 (beat)
          such is life. so dump that phony
          bastard and come to the open in my
          corner -- you can delay your
          romantic urges, which i know are
          lurking in there among the excess
          of brain cells you possess --
          until the appropriate time...
                 (beat)
          tell me you're not at least
          moderately attracted to me.

tin cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows --
for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.

                        molly
          you have moments.

                        tin cup
          tell me which ones are my moments
          and i'll try to duplicate them.

                        molly
          this is a moment. you look great.

                         tin cup
          now?!

                        molly
          utterly exposed, completely
          vulnerable, the inner child trying
          to get out.

                                                               86.

                             tin cup
               my inner child needs spanking.

                             molly
               you always liked that part about
               saddling up, the smell of leather
               --

                             tin cup
               c'mon, let's have a drink. call
               it therapy. charge me 75 an hour.
               little cuervo, little freud...

     she's thinking about it.

                             molly
               naw... i gotta go.
                      (turns to leave)
               oh, i don't have a car, i
               need a ride.

                                                    cut to:
