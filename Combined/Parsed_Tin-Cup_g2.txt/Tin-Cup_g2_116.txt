      a roar goes up from the milling fans as tin cup emerges.
      he tries to smile, but it's all dawning on him.

                                 tin cup
                   my god... i just gave away the
                   open...

      and then mccord is there, shoving a mike in tin cup's
      face.

                                                                  132.
                               mccord
                 ledge, i know it's tough to talk
                 right now, but --

                               tin cup
                 it's not difficult to talk... it's
                 difficult to explain... i coulda
                 laid up and still won. i made a
                 twelve on the last hole of the u.s.
                 open. you know how much money
                 that cost me?

                               mccord
                 cost you a bundle...

                               tin cup
                 i gotta get outta here.

                               mccord
                 it was the greatest 12 i ever saw.
                 back to you, jim...

       tin cup exits the scorers' tent and runs into the
       regulars -- they're beaming, undyingly loyal.

                               clint and earl
                 greatest 12 i ever saw... you
                 crunched that dog, baby...
                 gorgeous shot, etc...

       he looks up and there's molly -- he stops short.    they
       embrace.

                               tin cup
                 molly, i'm an idiot. i gave away
                 the open. the one time in my life
                 i know the play is to hit the lay
                 up -- my whole life and future
                 and career on the line, and i
                 still can't make myself do it. i
                 am a twisted human being and a
                 cautionary tale. and i guess i'm
                 a fool?

                                molly
                 yes.   a magnificent fool...

       romeo and doreen eye each other -- locked in a stare
       of longing and mystery. tango music comes from a
       boom box. they begin to move toward each other
       in a tango step.
