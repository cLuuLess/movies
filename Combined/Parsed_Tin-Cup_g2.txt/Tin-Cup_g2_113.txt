      tin cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying
      nothing.

      romeo hands him another ball.

      tin cup unloads another 3-wood.    another splash.

      tin cup holds out his hand again.

                               romeo
                 this is your last ball, man. if
                 this gets wet, you disqualified.
