90   int. winnebago - day                                          90

     romeo and tin cup stare out into the trees, the lushness
     -- a couple of wide-eyed kids.

                             tin cup
               i bet this is the first winnebago
               they ever saw here...

                                                            89.

                        romeo
          yeah... and the first mexican...

the winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- a security
guard comes to the window. a banner hangs above the
entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming:
"old pines -- u.s. open championship."

                        security guard
          yes?

                        romeo
          como esta, amigo. i have with me
          one of the legendary ball strikers
          in the history of golf --

the security guard strains to see in.

                        security guard
          who's that? mr. crenshaw? that you?
          mr. price, mr. norman? no?

tin cup leans across romeo to introduce himself.

                        tin cup
          roy 'tin cup' mcavoy.
          representing the great american
          southwest.

the guard backs off quickly, turns to his second.

                        security guard
          do we have a... mccormack... on
          the list.

                        romeo
          mcavoy -- roy mcavoy -- he's a
          legend!

                        security guard
          we got over 150 legends in this
          tournament. sorry.

romeo starts cursing in spanish.   the guard is unphased.

                        security guard
          call the police.

                        romeo
          police?

the police quickly appear to take over the situation.
tin cup leaps out of the winnebago to argue his point.

                        tin cup
          there's a mistake here, fellas!

                                                           90.

a cop grabs tin cup and roy is ready to fight.   it's
getting ugly real fast.

                        cop
          we'll throw your ass in jail right
          now, pal -- there's a lotta
          lunatics here and we don't take
          chances...

at that moment david simms pulls in, driving a con-
vertible sponsor's car. he sees the scuffle, gets
out.

                        simms
          what's the problem here?

                        security guard
          this clown says he's in the
          open...

simms spots tin cup -- a delicious moment for him. tin
cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face.

                        tin cup
          hiya, david... nice sweater.

                        security guard
          he's not on the list.

simms takes the clipboard with the list.

                        simms
          hiya, roy... welcome to the big
          leagues...
                 (checks the list)
          here ya go, charlie, his name's
          right here.
                 (to tin cup)
          they spelled your name wrong --
          easy mistake with a total unknown.

                        security guard
                 (to cop)
          let him in.

simms smiles at tin cup, the easy smile of a man on top.

tin cup doesn't respond, just asks the guard:

                        tin cup
          which way to the practice range?

as tin cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back
into the winnebago --

                                                                 91.
                             security guard
                      (to simms)
               he said he was a 'legend'?

                             simms
               oh he is... he's a very big name
               at a driving range in salome,
               texas...

     they all have a good laugh, and --

                                                    cut to:
