62   int. golden tassel - night                                  62

     a nearly nude dancer named sammantha on stage to a big
     saturday night crowd. tin cup's in the front row,
     sitting with doreen and a beer. disconsolate.

                             p.a. announcer (v.o.)
               bring out those bills, boys, if ya
               wanta see a little more of
               sammantha!

     guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway,
     placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper.

                             sammantha
                      (to tin cup)
               hey, honey...

                                                      67.

tin cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster
wave, he's depressed -- or something.

                           tin cup
          hey, honey...

                        doreen
          i heard you qualified for the
          regionals -- why you so down?

                        tin cup
          i broke my clubs -- don't ask why,
          my caddie's pissed off at me, i
          lost my wheels in a sucker bet,
          and my shrink thinks i'm a fool --
          'cause i probably am...

                        doreen
          you're seeing a therapist?!

                        tin cup
          yeah, what's wrong with that?

                        doreen
          only way you'd ever go into
          therapy was if the shrink was a
          doll and you were trying to get
          her into the rack --

                        tin cup
          you're so shallow. the good
          doctor and i are dealing with my
          regression and denial --

                         doreen
          oh, tin cup, what a crock.    you
          got a hard-on.

a guy from the next table leans over, interrupting.

                           guy
          you `tin cup'?     won the local with
          a seven iron?

                           tin cup
          that's me.

                         guy
          mcavoy?   the tin cup mcavoy?

                        doreen
          there's only one -- thank god...

                         tin cup
          yeah.   you looking for a game?

                                                            68.
                        guy
          no, but i'd sure like to show you
          my grip...

doreen can't keep his attention. neither can sammantha,
who writhes only a few feet away.

                         doreen
          how long have you been seeing this
          `good doctor'?

                        tin cup
          excuse me, dor', the man's having
          trouble with his grip --

the guy slides over to tin cup, quickly joined by his
buddies.

                        guy
          see, i used to play a real weak
          grip. but you look at couples,
          he's got a left hand way over
          here...

tin cup glances at the guy's grip.

                        tin cup
          no, grip it like this, so you're
          holding on with the last two
          fingers of your left hand.

the guy nudges the cowboy next to him.

                        guy
          see that? tin cup mcavoy says you
          grip a golf club like this, with
          these two fingers.

                         doreen
          roy?
                  (off no response)
          roy?   tin cup? hello?

                        tin cup
          the grip and address are about 90
          percent of the golf swing, so pay
          attention here...

                        cowboy
          when you're done with him, can i
          ask you about my club position at
          address?

sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though
she's down to a g-string, inches away. at the height of
the music, she stops dancing and looks down at doreen --

                                                                 69.
                             sammantha
               am i doing something wrong?

                             doreen
               no, honey, you ain't -- but a
               healthy woman's only got two
               choices in this world of ours...
                      (beat)
               either fall in love with another
               woman -- or take up golf.

     and doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but not
     at all surprised. she knows tin cup -- she knows men.

                             tin cup
               ... now the stronger right-hand
               grip can help ya draw the ball,
               which i plan to do at the
               regionals next week in tulsa...
               just shift the hand over a little
               bit... blah, blah, blah...

     ... and naked women dance before them, unnoticed.

                                                    cut to:
