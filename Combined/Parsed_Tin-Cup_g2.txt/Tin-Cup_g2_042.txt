65   ext. la paloma golf club (arizona) - day                      65

     the regional qualifier -- 36-hole tournament pitting all
     the local winners. this is a much bigger deal than the
     local tournament -- more commercial, bigger crowds,
     tougher.


     montage of regionals

     accompanied by molly's voice and the music of jones,
     taylor, others.

                                                                71.


     close on tin cup

     he puts the walkman headset over his ears on the first
     tee. we hear what he hears, and --

                              molly (v.o.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `private victories precede
                public victories. you cannot
                harvest a crop before you plant
                it...'

     kaboom!   he launches a tee shot down the middle.

                              molly (v.o)
                       (on tape)
                ... `how you view the problem, is
                the problem...'


66   tin cup chips into the cup.                                66


67   tin cup drains putt after putt with confidence.            67

                              molly (v.o.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `follow your bliss...'


68   tin cup takes a club from earl who's huffing and           68
     puffing a little too hard for a caddie, and --

     tin cup crisps a three iron over water to a tight green.

     tin cup is carrying his own bag now -- earl is several
     paces behind, dragging his body slowly, exhausted.


69   close on scoreboard -- even par, even, even, one           69
     under...

                              molly (v.o.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `say not that i have found the
                truth but that i have found a
                truth...'


70   close on tin cup -- still in a zone, confident,            70
     relaxed, hitting lots of good shots. but the score is
     close, the competition tougher. he's near the top,
     but not first.

                                                                72.
71   tin cup lips out a fifteen-foot putt -- heartbreak.        71
     he starts to lose it, but...

                             molly (v.o.)
                      (on tape)
               ...`you can't have the fruits
               without the roots...'

     and tin cup just smiles and taps in.


72   scoreboard tells us we're down to the 36th, final hole.    72


73                           tin cup                            73
               whattya think, earl?

                             earl
               i think three under will qualify.
               you need birdie. i could shit.

                             tin cup
               a little more confidence there,
               earl...

                             earl
               i wish romeo was here. i ain't
               cut out to do this. i'm a
               spectator by nature. an observer.
               i'm a --

                             tin cup
               shut up and hand me the big dog.

                             earl
               you got it.

     tin cup takes the driver and uncoils a beauty.

                             tin cup
               the force is with me, pods...

                                                      cut to:


74   tin cup hits a wedge approach -- the ball lands inches     74
     from the hole. the crowd gasps... but --

     the backspin grabs it and the ball spins back and back
     and back, ten, twenty, thirty feet before coming to a
     rest.

     the men head solemnly to the final green.

                                                      cut to:

                                                                 73.
