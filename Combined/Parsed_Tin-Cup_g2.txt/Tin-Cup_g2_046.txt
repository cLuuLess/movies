80   ext. range - that night (much later)                          80

     thwock, thwock, thwock! -- night has fallen and he still
     has the shanks.

     the regulars have gathered and are huddled, murmuring.
     the word has spread like wildfire -- tin cup has the
     shanks.

                             clint
               never thought it would happen...

                             earl
               the shanks is for us mortals, not

                                                          79.
          for the great ones...

                        jose
          esta muy feo... muy, muy feo...

(it is very ugly, very, very ugly...)

tin cup angrily throws his club out into the night and
turns to the regulars.

                        tin cup
          y'know why they named this game
          'golf'? 'cause the words 'fuck'
          and 'shit' were already taken!

a car horn honks -- all heads turn to see:


pov shot - pink corvette

pulls in -- doreen gets out, carrying a big package.

                           doreen
          hiya, fellas!

                        tin cup
          what is this? everybody like to
          watch a train wreck?!

doreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the
first time that there are a number of bags and packages
with the boys.

                        doreen
          he's in one of his pleasant moods,
          i see --

                        romeo
          he's got the shanks. we got the
          makings of a greek tragedy here.

                        doreen
                 (shouting to
                  tin cup)
          quit whining and get over here.
          we've got something for you.

tin cup drags his sorry ass to the group.

                        tin cup
          unless it's a 'swing thought,' i'm
          not interested...

                        doreen
                 (ignoring his
                  attitude)
          we're here to sponsor you in the

                                                            80.
          open. me an' the boys have pooled
          our resources and come up with
          some cash so you can look and feel
          as spiffy as all them big-name
          pros.

                        tin cup
          but i got the shanks --

                        doreen
          yeah, and you obviously still have
          a hard-on for the doctor chick --
          your face is all screwed up and
          tight like you haven't been laid
          in awhile --

                        tin cup
          is it really that obvious?

                        doreen
          it's not a good look for you.
          roy, your heart is not the only
          organ you wear on your sleeve.
          there's a certain, vulgar appeal
          to your transparency.

tin cup shrugs.   she always has him outflanked.

                        clint
          c'mon, tin cup, we're trying to
          make you a presentation --

                        tin cup
          awright, awright...

she unwraps a tour golf bag -- big gold and red lettering
advertises "the golden tassel." pastie tassels hang from
all over the bag. doreen sets it down proudly.

                        doreen
          i got the golden tassel to sponsor
          you at the open.

                        tin cup
          you expect me to pack that around?

                        romeo
          i'm carrying the bag.

                        doreen
          it's worth four hundred dollars
          endorsement money to you --

earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn
on patches and logos.

                                                        81.
                        earl
          see, dewey got you first state
          banking of salome, and clint got
          you short-haul trucking and i got
          you brink and brown sanitation --

                        tin cup
          i'm being sponsored by a sewage
          disposal system?

                        earl
          we call it human resources
          management, roy, please...

jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned.

                        jose
          i've got wally's smokehouse for ya
          -- kind of a nice sign...

                        dewey
          and since i couldn't get the post
          office to come aboard, me and my
          girl friend muriel's gonna buy a
          fan club patch you can put anywhere
          you want.

doreen and the regulars look at tin cup proudly.

                        tin cup
          i'm supposed to wear this shit?

                        jose
          this shit is us, man.   you can't
          win without us.

                        doreen
          you're the pride of salome!

                        tin cup
          hell, i won't even make the cut!

                        doreen
          what happened to your confidence?

                        romeo
          he's shanking his love life so
          he's shanking the golf ball.

                        doreen
          must be true love.

                          romeo
          he's a goner.

tin cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and
starts loosening up. these are his people, after all,

                                                                   82.
     and they're behind him all the way.

                             tin cup
               look, everybody, this is great.
               i'm sorry i'm acting so pathetic
               but my swing's never abandoned me
               before. i just need a little time
               to work it out.

                             earl
               anything you want --

                             clint
               give him some room, boys --

                             tin cup
                      (to anyone who'll
                       listen)
               maybe it's my grip... maybe i'm
               opening up too soon... too late...
               coming over the top... no,
               dropping underneath...
                      (beat)
               oh, sweet jesus, why have you
               abandoned me?

                             doreen
                      (to the regulars)
               he's trying to talk to god.   it's
               time for us to go.

     doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave tin
     cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly,
     his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.

                             romeo
               you want me to stay, boss?

                             tin cup
               i need to be alone.

                             romeo
               you got it.

     and romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the
     lot. and as they drive away, tin cup sits down, his head
     in his hands.

                                                    dissolve to:
