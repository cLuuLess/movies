42    int. molly's office - few beats later - day                42

      tin cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he
      heard that's what you do. he stares at the ceiling.
      molly enters and sits down.

                              molly
                roy... are you okay?

                              tin cup
                i need therapy.

                                 molly
                obviously.

                              tin cup
                what do i do? i mean... to do it
                ... therapy... i mean, how do i
                start doing... it.

                              molly
                in parlance you might understand,
                just kick back and let the big dog
                eat.

      he sighs and plunges in.

                                     44.

               tin cup
okay, okay, let 'er rip...
        (deep breath)
suppose there's this guy. he's
standing on the shore of a big,
wide river. and the river's fulla
all manner of disaster, like
alligators and piranhas and
currents and eddies, and most
people won't even go down there to
dip a toe. but on the other side
of the river's a million dollars,
and on this side of the river
there's a rowboat. i guess my
question's this: what would
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it?

                 molly
he's an idiot.

              tin cup
no. he's a hell of a swimmer,
see. his problem's more like...
why's he always gotta rise to the
challenge?

              molly
he's a juvenile idiot.

              tin cup
you don't understand what i mean
by the river.

              molly
we're talking about you and what
you like to call your inner
demons, roy, that human frailty
you like to blather about, not
some mytho-poetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit.

              tin cup
y'mean you're gonna make me feel
lousy? i came here to feel better
-- what kinda therapy is this?

              molly
you don't have any inner demons.
what you have is inner crapola,
inner debris -- garbage, loose
wires, horseshit in staggering
amounts.

                                     45.
              tin cup
i ain't just some jerk driving-
range pro who drinks too much
booze and eats too few vegetables.

              molly
you're being defensive -- cut to
the chase and tell me why you're
here.

              tin cup
well... i'm smitten with a woman.

               molly
that's good.   is she smitten with
you?

               tin cup
not yet.

              molly
have you asked her out?

              tin cup
she's seeing a guy. i don't know
how serious it is, but the guy's a
real horse's ass, in my opinion...

              molly
if you shared your heart with this
woman -- maybe asked her out to
dinner -- then it would force
these issues out in the open.

              tin cup
i'm afraid she'll say no.

               molly
ahh... so what you're saying is
that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested
waters are really just about your
golf game -- not about your
personal life.

              tin cup
christ, i didn't know we were
gonna get into my personal life!

              molly
this is therapy!

              tin cup
well, jeez, i know, but i didn't
think it was that kind of
therapy...

                                                          46.
                        molly
          what were you expecting?    ann
          landers?

                            tin cup
          yeah.

                        molly
          look, it's rather simple. those
          risks that you love to take on the
          golf course, the risks you talk so
          passionately and poetically about
          -- you need to apply those risks
          to your personal life with the
          same passion.

                        tin cup
          i should ask this woman out.

                            molly
          yes!

                        tin cup
          i should risk coming right over
          the top and snap-hooking it out of
          bounds left.

                            molly
          yes!

                        tin cup
          risk hitting it a little thin
          and --

                        molly
          for godsakes, roy, that's enough!

                            tin cup
          right.   sorry.

                        molly
          s'okay...
                 (beat)
          look, just walk up to this woman,
          wherever she is, look her in the
          eye with those big beautiful green
          eyes of yours, let down your guard
          and don't try to be smooth or cool
          or whatever -- just be honest and
          take the risk -- you can do it!

tin cup rises with new confidence. he does several deep
breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. she
stares at him. and he walks right up to her.

                        tin cup
          dr. griswold -- i think i'm in

                                                       47.
          love with you.

molly is stunned.

                           molly
          what?!

                        tin cup
          from the moment i first saw you i
          knew i was through with bar girls
          and strippers and motorcycle
          chicks, and when you started
          talking i was smitten and i'm
          smitten more every day i think
          about you -- and the fact that
          you know i'm full of crapola
          only makes you more attractive
          to me because usually i can
          bullshit people but i can't
          bullshit you and in addition, most
          women i'm thinking about how to get
          into their pants from day one but
          with you i'm just thinking about
          how to get into your heart --

molly was clue-less.   she just stares.

                           molly
          my god...

                         tin cup
                 (optimistically,
                   proudly)
          stunned, eh? so what about dinner
          and we can talk about `us' and if
          we have a future and how to drop
          that horse's ass boyfriend of
          yours --

                        molly
          roy, slow down --

                        tin cup
          hey! i just hit a eight degree
          driver off a cart path here, i'm
          staring eagle in the face --

                        molly
          this is a terrible mistake!

tin cup is knocked off his horse.   into deep rough.

                        tin cup
          i'm acting from the heart so i
          can't make a mistake?! right?

                                                                 48.
                               molly
                 wrong.  aw, shit...
                        (beat)
                 i am one horrible shrink...
                 jeez... i didn't know you were
                 talking about me.

                               tin cup
                 would your advice have been
                 different?

     she's frustrated and at a loss for words.

                               molly
                 session's over. you better leave.

     crushed, tin cup heads to the door, stops and turns.

                               tin cup
                 i'm gonna qualify for the u.s.
                 open and kick your boyfriend's
                 ass.

                                 molly
                 please leave.

                               tin cup
                 whatever you think of me, you
                 should know that your boyfriend
                 hates old people, children, and
                 dogs.

     he exits.   she just sits there.

                                                     cut to:
