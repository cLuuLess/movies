31   int. winnebago - night                                   31

     romeo ponders tin cup's dilemma from the couch.

                             romeo
               man, you are having a bad week.

                             tin cup
               she must think i'm such a nothing,
               such a loser... a lousy driving
               range pro living in a winnebago,
               making five bucks an hour plus
               lessons.

                             romeo
               she don't know you live in a
               winnebago.

                             tin cup
               well, she sure as hell knows i
               ain't taking her to no doral for
               massages and mimosas all weekend.
               i gotta do something with my life.

     he reflects deeply while romeo shrugs.

                             tin cup
               i gotta rise to a level worthy of
               the women that think i'm a joke.

                             romeo
               well... you could go out and win
               the open.

                             tin cup
                      (pausing, as
                       if jarred)
               romeo, that idea has promise.

                               romeo
               i was joking.

                               tin cup
               i ain't.

                                     34.
              romeo
we talking about the same
tournament? the u.s. open? the
biggest golf tournament in the
world?

              tin cup
not just the biggest golf
tournament in the world; the most
democratic.

              romeo
what do you mean?

              tin cup
i mean it's open. anyone's got a
shot at it. you just gotta get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier, and unlike doral or
colonial or the a.t.t., they can't
keep you out. they can't ask you
if you're a garbageman or a bean-
picker or a driving range pro
whose check is signed by a
stripper. you qualify, you're in.

              romeo
and then you pay out of your own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidated --

              tin cup
who's intimidated? i just told
you i'm gonna win the damn thing!

              romeo
you don't got the game.

              tin cup
i got every shot in the book.

              romeo
i said you don't got the game.
the mental game. the head game.

              tin cup
you suggesting i err on the side
of excess?

              romeo
you always go out to shoot zero.
sometimes you pull it off. but
you can't play like that at the
open. you win by taking what the
course gives you. you win by
being humble, which you aren't,
and patient, which you never will

                                                               35.
               be.

     tin cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an
     arm around romeo.

                             tin cup
               well, since you're the authority,
               how'd you like to teach me how to
               be what i ain't and never will be?

                             romeo
               you don't ever listen to me.

                             tin cup
               this time'll be different.   i
               promise.

                             romeo
               i don't know, man. right now you
               don't even got the money to get
               your clubs out of hock.

                             tin cup
               yeah, well... my sticks may be in
               a pawn shop, but i got a rake and
               a hoe at the range.

                                                    cut to:
