58   ext. 19th hole - outdoor bar - day (later)                  58

     tin cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much
     of the gallery. he's a local hero -- but molly's not
     impressed.

     a waitress delivers a tray of long neck beers.

                             19th hole waitress
               beer for everybody.

                             clint
               you the man, tin cup!

     a toast is raised to their king, and tin cup eats it up.

                             tin cup
               thanks, boys, what'ya think was my
               best shot -- the seven iron on
               twelve, the seven iron on
               fourteen, or maybe it was the
               bunker shot on eighteen which, to
               my recollection was a -- seven iron?

     much laughter.   this is the tin cup they love.

                             earl
               you definitely the man!

                             tin cup
               how'd i do, doc?

                             molly
                      (cheerfully)
               you failed miserably.

                                     61.
              tin cup
what?! i parred the back nine
with a seven iron, i qualified for
the regionals, i --

              molly
your job is not just to qualify
for the open, it's to prepare for
the open. my job is to help you
prepare.

              tin cup
you said to 'trust my feelings'!

              molly
i didn't know you felt like
breaking all the clubs in your
bag.

              clint
he didn't break the seven!

              earl
he smoked that seven, brother --

              molly
from what i understand, the u.s.
open is the most difficult golf
tournament in the world played
under the most difficult
circumstances with the greatest
players -- winning it means
controlling yourself, managing
your emotions, staying cool, not
getting in a pissing contest with
your caddie who, incidentally,
quit.

              tin cup
he always quits, he always comes
back.

              molly
nonetheless, from the mental
aspect -- which is my domain --
you have regressed and are
fumbling somewhere between
delusion and denial.

              tin cup
'regression, delusion, denial'?
you gotta use all this
psychological language?

              molly
i'm a psychologist.

                                                            62.
tin cup turns to the regulars for support.

                         voice (o.s.)
           have a bad day, roy?

everyone turns to see david simms enter the conversation.

                          molly
           hi, honey...

                         tin cup
           i shot 65 -- parred the backside
           with a seven iron.

                         simms
                  (intrigued)
           why?

                         molly
           that's the question -- why?

silence.

                         clint
           'cause he broke all his other
           clubs.

                         earl
           snapped 'em in two -- even the
           putter.

                         simms
           jesus, roy, i'm on your side here.
           we go way back... i hope you get
           into the open, but if you don't
           play under control, you'll get
           slaughtered. good players shoot
           82 in the open. you can't always
           go for it.

                         tin cup
           swear to god, doc, this guy is
           not who you think.

                         clint
           it's a well-known fact that if a
           camera's not on him, he treats old
           people and children like dirt.

                          earl
           and dogs.

                         tin cup
           yeah, don't forget the dogs.

                         molly
           i think we should go, david.

                                                           63.

                          simms
          i think so...

tin cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let
go.

                        tin cup
          you ever shoot par with a seven
          iron?

                        simms
          it never occurred to me to try.
                 (to molly)
          c'mon, let's go. the car's over
          here....

                        tin cup
          i'll bet you a thousand dollars
          against my car that i can beat you
          in any game -- any game, you name
          it -- with a seven iron.

                        simms
          this is ridiculous.

                        tin cup
          you a coward? you gonna lay up
          the way you did at the masters
          last year?

                        regulars
                 (taunting, like
                  children)
          chickie, chickie, chickie...

simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge
as the desire to shut up tin cup.

                        simms
          any game, i name it?

                        molly
          oh, come on, david --

                        simms
          i just want to teach him a lesson.

                        molly
          why do men insist on measuring
          their dicks?

tin cup takes her literally and rises, starting to
unbuckle his belt.

                        tin cup
          awright, awright! let's measure,

                                                            64.
          right now!

                        molly
          for god sakes, i wasn't being
          literal!
                 (beat)
          david, let's go.

                        simms
          molly, trust me on this one. call
          it part of his mental preparation
          for the open, where the rough is
          deep, the greens are slick, and
          the nerves are shattered.
                 (to tin cup)
          i'll take the bet.

                          molly
          oh, jeez...

the regulars cheer -- this is what they live for. simms
hands a roll of cash to molly. tin cup hands her his car
keys.

                         tin cup
          awright!   what's the game?

                        simms
          one swing each. who can hit the
          longest seven iron --

                        tin cup
          it's a lock! i hit the seven like
          john daly hits a three!

the regulars whoop it up. their man's a cinch. tin cup
pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the
ground in the middle of the patio.

                        tin cup
          from right here, okay?

                          simms
          fine with me.

                        molly
          you guys are really being
          childish --

                        simms
          molly, leave this one to me.

                        tin cup
          dr. griswold, i know what i'm
          doing.

tin cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out

                                                            65.
onto an open area of the course.   serious, intent, the
look of eagles...

                        tin cup
                 (to himself)
          dollar bills...

he takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and
launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers... to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his
faithful.

the ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further.

                        clint
          them signs are at least thirty
          yards farther -- that ball musta
          gone 220...

                        tin cup
          that ball's about 2-2-7... toed it
          a bit... but it'll do...

                        regulars
          nearly 230 with a seven!    pureed
          it, baby, he pureed it!

tin cup hands simms the seven iron.

                        tin cup
          take a minute to limber up, fine
          with me --

                           simms
          don't need to.

simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes.

                        tin cup
          take your jacket off?

                        simms
          no, no, i'm fine.

simms drops a ball about where tin cup's sat.   he stands
above the ball and addresses it.

                         tin cup
                  (cockily)
          you're gonna need to muscle up,
          big guy -- give it the old steroid
          jerk...

simms is cool as ice. he smiles, then moves around to
the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the
course. this baffles everyone.

                                                                 66.
                             regulars
               what the hell you doin'?    wha's
               this?

     and david simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward
     the desert, onto the lonely highway...

59   ... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for    59
     about three miles, forever. it's probably still going...

     close on molly

     she shrugs and smiles.
