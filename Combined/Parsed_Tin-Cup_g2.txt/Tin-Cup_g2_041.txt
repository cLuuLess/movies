     tin cup drives, as most of the regulars lounge -- all are
     there including turk (the bouncer). but romeo is
     missing.

                             clint
               we get through the next 36 holes
               and we in the open!

                             earl
               i got the yips and i ain't even
               teeing it up...

                             tin cup
               nothing to worry about, boys --

                             jose
               but you ain't got romeo?

                              tin cup
               don't need him till the open --
               he'll be back.

                                                                   70.
                             clint
               but you don't got the doctor lady?

                             tin cup
               oh no, i got her. right here.

     he holds up a tape cassette.

                             tin cup
               she can't travel to arizona for
               the regionals -- she's got a busy
               practice, y'know... so she made me
               this tape to play while i'm out
               there... keep me calm, cool, and
               collected...

                               earl
               what's on it?

                             tin cup
               a little james taylor, little
               george jones, little kahlil
               gibran, little this, little
               that... and a lotta the voice of
               the smartest chick i ever met.

                             earl
               the good doctor herself...

                             clint
               can we hear it or is it personal?

                             tin cup
               since when is therapy personal,
               eh?

     he punches into his deck and the winnebago is filled with
     the sounds of molly's tape, beginning with george
     jones...

     ... and the voice of george jones takes us into...

                                                    dissolve to:
