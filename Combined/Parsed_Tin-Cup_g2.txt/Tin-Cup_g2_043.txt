75   ext. la paloma - 18th green - day                           75

     tin cup surveys the thirty-foot snake of a putt.   earl's
     of absolutely no use.

                              tin cup
               we need this one big time, earl,
               whattya think?

                             earl
                      (unsurely)
               looks straight to me.

                             tin cup
               straight?! thing's a roller
               coaster breaks four ways and dies
               at the hole -- you're blind!

                             earl
               actually, i am blind... 20-60 in
               one eye -- and that's the good
               eye...

                              tin cup
               i got a blind caddie... just hold
               the stick, earl -- and be sure to
               pull it out...

     tin cup studies the hell out of this putt. if it goes
     in, he's in the open. he misses, back to salome.

                             molly (v.o.)
                      (on tape)
               ... when the going gets tough,
               the, the, the, whirrrrrrrrrrr,
               the, the...

     tin cup shakes the walkman and pounds his ears.

                             tin cup
               doc?  doc?
                      (panicky)
               earl, earl -- the tape's jammed!
               she's abandoning me!

                               marshal
               are you okay?

                             tin cup
               yeah, yeah... i'm flying solo
               now...

                               marshal
               what?

                             tin cup
               i gotta make this putt.

                                                                 74.

                             marshal
               obviously.

     tin cup stares endlessly at the long putt.

                             tin cup
               ... just pick the line, feel the
               speed -- bad timing, doc, jesus...

     he steps up to the putt, still talking to himself.

                             tin cup
               like a million others you made in
               your life, roy. just see it going
               in. just feel it... right in the
               back of the jar... just pull the
               goddamn trigger, you pussy...


76   he strokes the putt -- it starts right, curls back          76
     left, straightens out, over the ridge, back again,
     endlessly...

                             tin cup
               pull the stick, earl, pull it!

     earl's having trouble with the flagstick, shaking it,
     panicking, and finally -- he snaps it free, but...

     the ball stops dead on the lip of the cup.

     tin cup contorts in anguished body-english, then falls to
     his back like a shot animal.

                             tin cup
               choking dogs die!

     and the ball falls into the cup with a click -- and a
     roar.

     tin cup takes a peek at the cup.   the ball stays in the
     hole.

                                                    cut to:
