109   ext. eighteenth fairway - day                               109

      tin cup and romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill
      carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green. a shot
      similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball.

                              romeo
                two-sixty to carry, roy. you got
                to lay up, man. i don't care how
                good you swinging. you got to lay

                                                                    107.
                up.

      tin cup looks at the iron romeo proffers. he looks back
      at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the
      wind. he looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the
      whole grand setting... and then:

      he locates molly behind the gallery ropes, watching.    she
      makes a little charging gesture with her fist. and:

      tin cup reaches defiantly past romeo and pulls out the
      three wood.
