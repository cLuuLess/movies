92   int. winnebago (in parking lot) - night                    92

     again to george jones on the cassette player, tin cup is
     doing a slow dance with his driver.

     romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink
     after drink for tin cup, who's thoroughly plastered.

                             tin cup
               it's three in the morning, romes,
               what time i tee off?

                             romeo
               seven-o-five... first group off...
               keep drinking, keep dancing...

                             tin cup
               that's four hours from now?

                             romeo
               you're drinking till five...
               c'mon, c'mon, have another --
                      (a tough coach)
               get you in shape --

                                                                   95.
      tin cup tosses down yet another drink, and staggers
      around the room with his driver until, finally, he
      collapses in a heap on the floor. romeo looks down
      at him coolly, like horse trainer wayne lukas sizing
      up his derby entry.

                              romeo
                nothing like the sight of a
                finely-tuned athlete on the verge
                of greatness...

      romeo tosses a blanket over tin cup lying on the floor.

                                                    cut to:


a93   ext. pine hills clubhouse - early morning                    a93

      two figures hurry across the lawn to the first tee.    our
      intrepid don quixote and sancho panza.
