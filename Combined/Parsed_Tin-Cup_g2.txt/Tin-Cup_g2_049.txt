     tin cup and molly in his convertible.   he works on her
     without pushing too hard.

                             tin cup
               i know a spot along the river's
               great to watch the sunset?

                                molly
               not tonight.

                             tin cup
               'not tonight' means maybe some
               other night?

                             molly
               i didn't mean it like that.

                             tin cup
               consciously you didn't mean it
               like that -- but how about
               unconsciously, you're the expert,
               did you mean it unconsciously?

                             molly
               unconsciously, roy, i don't have a
               clue what i'm talking about.

                             tin cup
               i feel we're making progress.

                                                                   87.

                  it's progress towards...

        the caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new
        mall. she gets out.

                                molly
                  good luck in the open, roy.

        he drives away, and we stay:


        close on molly

        watching tin cup careen away in his caddy.

               absolute truth -- you think i can
               go 72 holes without falling apart.

     romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear.

                             tin cup

               know.

     and tin cup puts on his walkman, and stares out the
     window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery,
     to the music of george jones...
