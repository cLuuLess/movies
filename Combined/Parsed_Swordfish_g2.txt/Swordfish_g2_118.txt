      gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against stan's
      head as he and marco roll around on the ground.

                                 stanley
                   won't do you any good. the money
                   jumps every 60 seconds from one
                   numbered account to another and
                   will for the next ten years.
                   'course it wasn't supposed to
                   happen for another six hours. the
                   power surge must have scrambled
                   the internal clock. but, you kill
                   me and you never get a single
                   dollar.

      gabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of rpms.

                                 stanley
                   you let the hostages go and then
                   i'll tell you where and when you
                   can extract the money. we all
                   walk away, nobody gets hurt. the
                   accounts are encrypted with a 1024
                   bit cipher. even i can't break
                   through the fire wall. it's my
                   act of god policy.
                          (beat)
                   deal?

                                   gabriel
                   i'm thinking.

      a very tense moment passes.      gabriel looks around.   he
      has an idea.

                                   gabriel
                   tell ya what.    no deal.

      marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the
      hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30-
      foot-high ceiling buttresses.

      gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs
      rush in and grab stanley, one placing a knife to his
      throat.

                                  gabriel
                   marco!   grab agent sculley!

      marco grabs ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over
      to where gabriel stands, brandishing the cable.

                                 stanley
                   no, don't do this.

      stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. gabriel
      hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it
      over ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. he
      cuts the cable-tie loose. she digs at them with her
      fingers.

      two mercs rush in and grab stanley, one placing a knife
      to his throat.

      stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow.

                                 gabriel
                   in all reality, stan, she has you
                   to thank for this. that first
                   night in prague you broke the
                   d.o.d. database that contained her
                   true identity. she's d.e.a.,
                   stan, but without you, i never
                   would have known.

                                 stanley
                          (freaking)
                   what are you doing? stop!

                                 gabriel
                   string up the d.e.a. bitch.

      marco hits the power switch. ginger is yanked up into
      the air, hanging twenty feet above the floor.

                                 stanley
                   just let her down. i'll do
                   whatever you want.

                                 gabriel
                   then get me my money, stan.

      stanley looks up at ginger, valiantly struggling for her
      life.

                                 stanley
                   i'm not doing shit until you bring
                   her down. i'm serious. let her
                   down. now!

                                 gabriel
                   okay.

      gabriel yanks out his .40 cal. h&k, turns and shoots the
      hanging ginger.

                                 stanley
                   nooo...

      stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her.

      he looks up at gabriel and runs at him.

      gabriel slaps him in the throat, spinning him, and grabs
      stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.

                          (close and very serious)
                   take a moment, big guy. don't
                   make me put you in a wheelchair.

      in the b.g. two mercs zip ginger's body into a black body
      bag and carry her out.

                                 stanley
                   you didn't have to kill her.

                                 gabriel
                   i didn't stan, you did.    but we're
                   not done yet.
                          (to marco)
                   marco...

      marco yanks a seventeen-year-old girl up from the floor
      and puts a gun to her head.

                                 gabriel
                   there are a lot of hostages here.
                   i cared about ginger, can you
                   imagine what i could do to someone
                   i don't care about. how long
                   before the money jumps?

                                    stanley
                   sixty seconds.

                                 gabriel
                   they better hope you installed a
                   back door or it could be a long
                   day. somebody get me a laptop.

      a laptop appears. gabriel hands it to stanley and nods
      to the mercs who drop him. stanley drops to his knees,
      placing the computer on the ground.

      stanley has logged onto the net via modem and we hear
      that familiar pulse as he does. he connects onto an
      encrypted site on the net. his fingers hum over the
      keys.

                                 computer merc
                          (looking at a screen)
                   money just jumped.

                                 gabriel
                          (looking at his watch)
                   okay, stan. sixty seconds.

      sweat rolls down stanley's face as he works on the
      machine. numbers scroll across the screen. five columns
      of numbers scroll.

                                 gabriel
                   forty-five seconds, stanley.

                                 stanley
                   i need another laptop, logged on!

      he tries to keep from looking up at the crying hostage.
      the columns decrease. another laptop appears.

                                 gabriel
                   twenty seconds, stan.

      his fingers still fly. three columns now.         he works on
      the other laptop with his right hand.

                                  gabriel
                   fifteen.   she's gonna die,
                   stanley.

                                   stanley
                   shut up!

      two.   then one.

                                   stanley
                   c'mon, c'mon.

      it scrolls down to one number.

                                   gabriel
                   ten.

      the home page for grand cayman banc appears on the other
      laptop. "account number" appears.

                                 gabriel
                   nine... eight... seven.

      stanley has typed in the account number and accesses the
      account. he flies through the transfer information.
      account balance. 6.9 billion dollars.

                                 stanley
                   i need your account number.

      someone hands him a legal pad.         he types it in.

                                 gabriel
                   four, three, two...

       "transfer?" -- "yes" -- transferring.

                                  gabriel
                    one.

                                  stanley
                    let her go.

       stanley jumps up and runs over to marco.        gabriel puts
       his gun to the back of stanley's head.

                                  stanley
                    now, goddammit, it's done.   let
                    her go!

       gabriel looks at one of his boys who is checking it with
       a different laptop. he nods. marco drops the girl.

                                  gabriel
                    well, that was fun.

                    well, 'bout time for us to leave.

                                  stanley
                    they'll never let you escape.
                    you've gone too far.

                                  gabriel
                    au contraire. do you hear that?
