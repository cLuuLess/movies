68   ext. sheer cliff - day                                         68

     roberts hangs in mid-air a moment, then he too begins the
     rolling fall down the hill.


     angle on stanley

     as he tries to keep his balance, is being beaten and
     battered by the sharp, rocky ground.

     finally, he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for
     fifteen feet. then it really gets bad.

     clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill
     to help control the erosion. to stanley however, it is
     the world's largest slip and slide.

     he is no longer able to control, even badly, his descent.
     now, he is flying down the cliff face, only the rocks and
     bushes that slam into his body, slows the descent.

     roberts, above him, is doing little better.


     long shot on cliff face

     as stan and roberts slide toward the eight lanes of
     blazing afternoon traffic on the pch.

     finally, stan bounces onto the black-top road.   he runs
     headlong into the traffic.

     cars screech, horns blaring, as they slide into each
     other. stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of
     escaping.

     roberts, now at   the bottom himself, watches as a car
     slides sideways   into stan, flipping him over it. stan,
     not stopping to   feel the pain, runs across the hood of a
     freshly-stopped   car.

                                                           51.
