                                 gabriel
                   i'm about to do something against
                   my better judgement. i'm going
                   to tell you something i never tell
                   anyone. i'm going to tell you
                   who i am.

                                    stanley
                   don't bother.     i know who you are.

                                   gabriel
                   do you?    you think i'm a bank
                   robber.    really, i'm just like you.

                                  stanley
                   like me?   you're a murderer.

                                 gabriel
                   that i am. and worse. much worse.
                   i am forced to operate on a
                   different plane than you. but, i
                   have ethics. rules to which i
                   must adhere.

                                 gabriel (cont'd)
                   200 years ago thomas jefferson
                   wrote a letter to madison because
                   he was concerned that the freedoms
                   of the constitution would be
                   ignored.

                                 stanley
                   i don't understand why the fuck
                   you're telling me this.

                                 gabriel
                   listen to me and you will. in the
                   1950s, armed with this letter,
                   j. edgar hoover created an
                   organization to protect the
                   freedoms of this country at all
                   costs.

                                 stanley
                   i don't care about any of this.
                   all i care about is my daughter.

                                 gabriel
                   i'm talking about your daughter.

                                    stanley
                   my daughter...

                                 gabriel
                   yes. you, your daughter and 200
                   million other americans who take
                   their freedoms for granted. you
                   don't understand what it takes
                   to protect those freedoms. that's
                   my job, stanley, to protect your
                   way of life at all costs.

                                  stanley
                   so you and your band of lunatics
                   are really stealing all this money
                   to protect me.

                                 gabriel
                   that's right, stanley --

      he opens the theatre door.

                                 gabriel
                   -- 'cause wars cost money.
