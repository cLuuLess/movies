      a merc sits at a desk with three laptops and four tiny
      extra monitors, all wired into a large bundle of cables
      that run across the floor.

                                 gabriel
                   we okay?

      the   merc looks up. on the monitors and laptop screens
      are   present-time shots of all angles of the building and
      the   surrounding area. the images constantly change as
      the   merc toggles through the images.

                   look at the cover pattern they've
                   set up. the right hand doesn't
                   know what the left's doing.

                   look at this bozo. if the shit
                   drops, he's gonna cap his buddy in
                   the back of the head. idiots.

      stanley sits down at the computer console and brings up
      the bank's mainframe.

                                 stanley
                   i need the disk.

      a merc hands it to him and stanley slides it in the
      computer. his hands work quickly.
