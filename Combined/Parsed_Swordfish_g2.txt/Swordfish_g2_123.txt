133    int. bus - day                                                 133

       we are moving through the city. behind the bus, a huge
       caravan of police cars and swat trucks follow.

                                 gabriel
                 stan, c'mere.

       stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with
       gabriel. all the hostages' eyes are on him. at the
       front he looks at gabriel.

                                 gabriel
                 take a look.

       cops block off side streets as the convoy, ala the
       gauntlet, rolls through l.a.

       gabriel seems to be in complete control, despite being
       surrounded by every law enforcement officer within a
       hundred miles.


133a   int. bus - day                                                 133a

       stan turns to gabriel, angry.   he grabs him, pushing him.

                               stanley
                 how the fuck can you justify all
                 this?

                               gabriel
                 you're not looking at the big
                 picture.

       gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail.

                               gabriel
                 stanley, here's a scenario. you
                 have the power to cure all of the
                 world's diseases. but the price
                 for this is that you must kill a
                 single, innocent child. could you
                 kill that child to save the world?

                                 stanley
                 no.

                               gabriel
                 you disappoint me, stanley.   it's
                 the greatest good.

       silence for several beats.

                               stanley
                 how about ten innocents?

                                                      (continued)

                                                                 100.

133a   continued:                                                       133a

                                  gabriel
                    now you're getting it.   how about
                    a hundred?

       gabriel becomes intense.

                                  gabriel
                    how about a thousand? not to save
                    the world, but just to preserve
                    our way of life.

                                  stanley
                    no man has the right to make that
                    decision. you're no different
                    than any other terrorist.

                                  gabriel
                    you're wrong, stanley. some men
                    are put here to shape destiny, to
                    protect freedom, despite the
                    atrocities they must commit. i am
                    one of those men. thousands die
                    every day for no reason at all,
                    where is your bleeding heart for
                    them? you give your twenty
                    dollars to greenpeace every year
                    and think you are changing the
                    world. what countries will
                    harbor terrorists, when they
                    realize the consequences of what
                    i will do? did you know i can
                    buy nuclear warheads in minsk
                    for forty million each? i buy
                    half a dozen, i even get a
                    discount.

       the driver, looking at his watch, says something to
       gabriel in french.

       gabriel replies to the driver, also in french.

                    i saw sugarland express, stan.
                    didn't like the way it ended.

       we see a sign that says "lax."          the bus turns off before
       they get to the sign.
