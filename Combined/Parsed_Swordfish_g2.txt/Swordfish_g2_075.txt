     int. gabriel's house - ginger's room - day

                                ginger
                         (quietly)
                  i'm d.e.a., stanley.

     stan and ginger hold a moment, as:

                                  gabriel (o.s.)
                  ginger...?

     stanley, in one quick thinking movement, rips the wire
     from ginger's chest and flings it behind the bed just as
     the door swings open. gabriel stands staring at them.
     ginger topless, weapon in hand and stanley who looks like
     he had the shit kicked out of him.

     ginger and stanley both stare at him.

                                gabriel
                  well, ging, doesn't this look
                  friendly.
                                                       (continued)

                                                               56a.

                                ginger
                  i'm a friendly girl.

     stanley looks at ginger for a beat.

                                stanley
                  actually...

     ginger stares at stanley, who turns to look at gabriel.
     gabriel looks at stan, waiting.

                                stanley
                  thought maybe you'd like to see me
                  get you your hydra.

                                gabriel
                  get?

                                                       (continued)

                                                                 57.

70   continued:    (3)                                                 70

     stan walks toward gabriel.

                                  stanley
                  c'mon.

     gabriel walks into the hall. stanley looks back at
     ginger who mouths the words "thank you." stanley ignores
     her. ginger reaches down and grabs a shirt off the bed.

                                gabriel (o.s.)
                  you look like shit. ginger kick
                  your ass?

                                  stanley (o.s.)
                           (deadpan)
                  funny.

     ginger sighs and tosses her gun onto the bed, then
     follows them.
