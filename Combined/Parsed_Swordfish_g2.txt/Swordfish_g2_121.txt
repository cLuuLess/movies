       the bus rolls down the street. slowly one by one, car
       with flashing lights after car with flashing lights pulls
       up behind it until a convoy rivaling that of the
       sugarland express has built up. choppers drop out of the
       air, shadowing the bright yellow school bus.

       gabriel's voice booms from speakers on the exterior of
       the bus.

                    i don't think any of us want a
                    repeat of this morning. keep at
                    least a hundred yards from this
                    bus at all times and i want the
                    airspace for five miles clear.
