     three geeky computer-types sit in front of a huge array
     of crts. they look up when roberts stalks into the room.
     he yanks off his jacket, crumbles it and throws it across
     the room. they just look at each other.

                                roberts
                  tell me you have some good news
                  for me.

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  actually we have a small ray of
                  hope in the vast darkness that is
                  your life, sir. check this out.

     on one of the 25-inch screens we see a terminal at lax
     with hundreds of people streaming by at 20x speed.
     torvalds is being apprehended. he freezes it.

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  see these two guys?

     he points at two men watching this action from the
     sideline. he pulls another monitor forward.

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  now watch this...

     he fast-forwards through the crowd until the two guys
     show up again. he freezes it.

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  recognize those two, same guys,
                  next day. question is --

     he slowly moves the action forward --

                                   fbi computer geek #1
                  -- who's that?

     the footage stops and zooms in on one of two travelers
     who the two men are meeting.

     it is stanley.

                                roberts
                  stanley jobson...

     the computer guys look at each other.    one hands roberts
     an open copy of wired magazine.

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  wired's man of the year, 1996.
                  pretty much a burnout but he was
                  the hacker zeitgeist of his day --

                                                       (continued)

                                                                39.

                                roberts
                  i know who jobson is. i busted
                  him.
                         (to stan's image)
                  why are you in l.a.?

     roberts looks at it. then at the screen.        a pop-up
     screen shows stanley's history.

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  his ex-wife lives in malibu.

                                fbi computer geek #2
                  the new husband owns backdoor
                  films, a shady porn production
                  house in chatsworth. decent
                  production value but they only
                  shoot on video. his wife actually
                  starred in a couple of his videos.
                  apparently she's an 'actress.'

     roberts moves the mouse to see ginger.

                                roberts
                  who's the chick?

                                fbi computer geek #1
                  we don't know yet, sir.

                                fbi computer geek #2
                  serious piece of talent.

                                fbi computer geek #3
                  way outta his league. something's
                  up.

                                fbi computer geek #2
                  you know he also has a ten-year-
                  old daughter, who he's not
                  supposed to see. maybe that's why
                  he's here.

     roberts looks at him like he's an idiot.

                                  fbi computer geek #2
                  or maybe not.

                                roberts
                  i want to know who that girl is.
                  pronto.

     roberts stands.

                                roberts
                  and stake out his daughter.

                                                                40.
