60   ext. pool - day                                                  60

     lounging by the pool is none other than our heroine,
     ginger, topless, wearing nothing more than tiny, oblong,
     green-tinted shades, a skimpy t-back, and a little silver
     ring through her left nipple. she's reading steven
     hawkings' a brief history of time. a shadow falls over
     her.

     the shadow moves.       ginger glances nonchalantly up, then:

                                 ginger
                         (sitting up,
                           grinning)
                  don't you have that just-fucked-
                  the-neighbor's-cat look this
                  morning.

     she reaches over, lights a cigarette, and inhales deeply.
     he smiles, looking her up and down.

                                  ginger
                  problem?

                                stanley
                  pretty impressive.

                                ginger
                  i thought we went over all that
                  last night.

                                stanley
                         (beat, then like
                          "stupid")
                  the book, ginger.

                                  ginger
                  ohhh.
                         (holding it out)
                  look, no pictures. get out of my
                  light.

                                                        (continued)

                                                              45.

60   continued:                                                     60

     they stare at each sharing a moment of god-only-knows-
     what, then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh-
     graders at the local skating rink.

     stanley nervously clears his throat.    she's got him.

                                stanley
                  can i borrow your car? there's
                  something i need to do.

     she reaches down beside the chair, grabs her keys and
     tosses them to him. then:

                                ginger
                  if you're going to see your
                  daughter, you might want to
                  reevaluate the way you look.
                         (goes back to
                          her book)
                  just a thought.

     he looks at her with open mouth amazement. in just 24
     hours, she already knows what makes him tick.

     she looks up from her book and winks at him, then returns
     to her reading.
