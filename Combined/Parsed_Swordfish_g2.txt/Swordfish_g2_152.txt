       stan looks around, all the hostages look back at him.
       stanley sees one of the stinger missile launchers, broken
       free of its box.

       roberts runs onto the roof and sees stanley who has the
       stinger to his shoulder. he hits the "on" switch and
       it whines to life.

       he sights through the scope as the explorer screams away
       and pulls the trigger. the missile rips out of the tube
       and flies toward the explorer.

       boom.

       the missile explosion combined with the fuel creates a
       tremendous fireball.

       roberts runs and tackles stanley to the ground. suddenly,
       swat guys dressed in full combat gear including masks that
       cover their faces surround them.

       they cuff them.    one of them almost steps on stanley's
       face.

       stretchers and emt medics run into the bus. we crane up.
       and see the absolute pandemonium of ambulances leaving
       and police cars arriving.
