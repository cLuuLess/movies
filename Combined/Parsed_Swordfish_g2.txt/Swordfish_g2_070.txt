69   ext. beach - day                                            69

     on the other side, stan runs down to the beach and runs
     down the sand at full-tilt, looking for any escape route.
     roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian
     accident which slowed him down a little. stan however is
     faster.

     stan does his best jerry rice, as he runs down the beach
     at full speed.

     suddenly, the taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach
     at stanley. stan veers, now running through the surf.
     the taurus veers as well, and stan is forced to slide
     across the hood to keep from getting whacked. the taurus
     breaks left, and slides further into the surf.

     the fbi driver hits the accelerator and bogs the taurus
     down, tires spinning, throwing sand. stan continues to
     run as roberts makes it to the taurus.

                             roberts
               fuck this.

     he pulls his .40 cal. from his shoulder holster and fires
     it into the air. roberts bends over trying to catch his
     breath.

     stanley stops, putting his hands up.

                             dark suit #2
               why didn't you do that earlier,
               sir?

     roberts looks at the agent.

                             dark suit #2
               sorry, sir.

                             roberts
               go get him.

     three of the agents bring stanley over.

     stan slides down by the back wheel.

                             roberts
               what are you doing in l.a., stan?

                              stanley
                      (catching his
                       breath)
               vacationing...

                                roberts
                  why were you running? we just
                  wanted to talk.

                                stanley
                  are you arresting me?

                                roberts
                  for violating your parole by
                  leaving texas without permission
                  or for evading a federal agent and
                  almost getting me killed in the
                  process?

     stan just looks at him.

                                 roberts
                  no, i'm not.

                                stanley
                  then why are we talking?

                                roberts
                  didn't know the court lifted the
                  sanction preventing you from
                  seeing your daughter.

                                 stanley
                  fuck you.

                                roberts
                  you just want to cut through the
                  pleasantries and get down to
                  business? fine. i can help you
                  with your daughter, stan. help
                  me, i'll help you.

                                stanley
                  you'll have to forgive me, the
                  fact that you put me in jail for
                  18 months doesn't inspire a lot of
                  trust.

                                roberts
                  whether i agreed with what you did
                  or not, you broke the law,
                  stanley.

                                stanley
                  i guess we were both doing what we
                  had to. this was a nice trip down
                  memory lane, but if you're not
                  arresting me...

                                roberts
                  so, why was it you are in l.a.
                  again?

                                  stanley
                  i told you --

                                 roberts
                  -- vacationing. that's right. ya
                  know it's funny. axl torvalds was
                  just here for a vacation, too.
                  isn't it odd that the two best
                  hackers in the world are here at
                  the same time.

                                stanley
                  i'm a sucker for disneyland.
                         (getting up)
                  tell torvalds i said hello.

                                roberts
                  if you're not careful you can tell
                  him yourself. he's dead.

     stanley looks at roberts.

                                roberts
                         (to his men)
                  give him a card.

     they do.   stan looks at it.

                                roberts
                  in case you think of anything else
                  you want to tell me.

     stan turns to walk off.

                                stanley
                         (to the agent
                          he elbowed)
                  sorry about your nose.

                                  roberts
                  hey, stan.

     stan turns.

                                roberts
                  you know, you're in way over your
                  head here.

                  i know.

                                roberts
                  it's a long walk back up the hill,
                  stanley. you want us to give you
                  a lift?

     stan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the
     long journey back up the hill. roberts collapses into
     the passenger seat.

                                   roberts
                  follow him.
