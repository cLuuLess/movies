     gabriel looks at the surveillance photos as they come up.
     we intercut as they speak.

                                gabriel
                         (irritated but
                          respectful)
                  senator, i sincerely hope you did
                  not contact me and jeopardize the
                  safety of me and my men for this.

                                reisman
                  goddamn right i did. you know
                  where i got that? from the deputy
                  director of the f.b.i. he thought
                  i might be interested.

                                gabriel
                  sir, with all due respect. do you
                  think there is any aspect of this
                  operation i am not fully aware of?

                                reisman
                  we are aborting the operation and
                  securing alternative means of
                  finance elsewhere.

                                 gabriel
                  what?

                                reisman
                  we are aborting this operation.
                  take a vacation.

                                 gabriel
                  a vacation?   have i ever failed
                  you, sir?

                                                       (continued)

                                                          64.

86   continued:                                                 86

                                reisman
                  that's not the point.

                                gabriel
                  it's my point. senator, this
                  operation is going forward.

                                reisman
                  you understand what you are
                  saying?

                                gabriel
                  everything is under control.

     he disconnects.
