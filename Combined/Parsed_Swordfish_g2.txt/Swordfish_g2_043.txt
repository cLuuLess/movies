42   int. fbi interrogation room - night                             42

                             roberts
               that's a real nice story.    but you
               haven't given me shit.

     torvalds knows this and smiles at roberts arrogantly.

     the door opens, an fbi agent sticks his head in.

                             agent #1
               excuse me, sir... you have a call.

                             roberts
               so, take a message.

                             agent #1
               it's assistant director joy, he
               said it's important.

                             roberts
               at least it's not my wife.
                      (to torvalds)
               you need to think about what else
               you know.
                      (then, to agent #1)
               watch him.

     roberts walks out of the room.    the fbi agent positions
     himself outside the door.
