10	ext. the marina (close on the fishing boat) - day

there are people on board, three men and two women. they look like 
guerilleros from somewhere in latin america. they're heavily armed, 
unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. they are 
obviously exhausted. they gaze up to the city. their deep-sunken eyes 
are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair.

another dead place. i tol' you. let's get 
out to the islands.

miguel
the radio signals were coming from this 
area.

tony
not from the city. in every city it's the 
same. dead. let's get out to the barrier 
islands. if there are survivors sending 
those signals that's where we'll find them.

miguel
plenty of time for the islands. the rest of 
our...life...on the islands...i think.

miguel is drifting. the sight of the dead city has pushed him a few 
inches closer to the brink of insanity. he catches himself and comes 
back toward reality.

miguel
we gotta see if there are others here. we 
came all this way. we're gonna check it 
out.
