110	ext. the backwater - night

the fishing boat that bought sarah and her friends to the island sits 
still in the channel. there are soldiers aboard, two of rhodes' men, 
pacing the deck, passing a bottle back and forth.

john (o.s.)
well, we found yer boat, lady, but so did 
they.

john, sarah and toby are huddled behind green cover peering out at 
the boat.

sarah
looks like just two. we can take 'em when 
the time comes.

john
we're only about a quarter-mile from cave 
entrance number five.

toby
that entrance is closest to the labs and 
the bee cages.

john
come on. let's go.

they move off stealthily.

they enter the clearing with the spectacular plants that miguel 
discovered. six feet tall, their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with 
their bells down, these are daturas, nightshades indigenous to 
southern florida and parts of the caribbean.

sally and jack, who we saw working on the nitro sticks, are chopping 
off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into large leaf bags. 
they're wearing hospital masks over their mouth and noses. john moves 
in to help. toby and sarah follow but john stops them.

john
just stand guard for now. spell us after a 
while. can't breathe this grass too long or 
somebody hafta carry you home.

work goes on in silence.
