76	ext. the jungle - evening

the group trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to 
chop a path with their blades. john speaks in low tones as they move.

john
bees. that's what we call the dead... the 
walking dead...here on gasparilla's island.

 sarah
gasparilla?

john
he was a pirate who sailed these waters 
long ago. his name is bein' borrowed these 
days by the long lost henry dickerson.

sarah
governor dickerson? of florida?

john
that's the man. he's been holed up here 
ever since the shit hit the fan. him and 
his family owned these islands 'round here. 
they was leasin' this one to the fed. the 
whole underneath is dug out. there was 
missiles here and laboratories and bomb 
proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. 
now this is dickerson's....gasparilla's... 
private fortress. him and a bunch o' his 
cronies from all the best golf courses in 
tallahassee...and his private army, of 
course.

sarah
we ran up against a platoon of soldiers. 
there were actually walking dead...in 
uniform...with guns.

john
captain rhodes and his red coat bees. they 
could sting, sister. we know you came up 
against 'em. we been watchin' you since you 
landed. couldn't help. i'm sorry for that. 
we ain't supposed to be outside. if we was 
spotted it could....well, it could be the 
end of everything.

spider is signing for everyone to be quiet. they all stop in their 
tracks. bill mcdermott swigs some more brandy. with the stealth of a 
mohican spider pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and 
peers through.
