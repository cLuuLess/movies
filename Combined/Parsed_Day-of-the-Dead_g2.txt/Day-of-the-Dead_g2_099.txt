99	int. a locker room in the cave - morning

people are changing clothes, going on and off duty. julie grant 
rushes in and moves to a locker where she pulls out her lab coat. 
mary henried enters the room, spots julie, and rushes towards her.

mary
where the hell have you been?

julie doesn't respond. she buttons her coat never looking up.

mary
julie. are you alright?
(still no response)
you were missed this morning. i need you. i 
don't want you getting your ass in hot 
water. i won't be able to help you if...

julie
i don't need any help from you!

julie slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit.

mary
julie...julie!

but she's gone. the locker door has bounced open. mary slams it and 
it bounces again. she pounds it with her fist. suddenly, a loud bell 
sounds. mary looks at her watch then exits.

there are two women cleaning the locker room with mops and pails. one 
of them turns to watch mary henried exit. we recognise her. it's 
spider.
