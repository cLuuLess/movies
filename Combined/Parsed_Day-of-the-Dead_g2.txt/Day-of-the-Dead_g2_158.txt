158	ext. the jungle - night

the rebels lead mary, the nurse and the children through the 
underneath. tricks is bleeding badly. toby helps him along. suddenly, 
as they break into a clearing, sarah stops cold. there on the ground, 
lying where we last saw it, is the corpse of miguel.

john
what is it?

sarah
it's...he was...one who came to the island 
with me.

toby
come on. no time.

sarah
he was killed...five days ago.

mary
maybe...maybe he wasn't dead. are you sure 
he was dead when you left him?

sarah
look at him. a hundred bullets. you tell 
me. was he dead?

there are tears in sarah's eyes.

sarah
five days...and he hasn't...risen. he 
hasn't risen.

toby
come on. there's no time. there's no time 
to lose.

the group pushes ahead. sarah kneels. she blesses herself and makes 
the sign of the cross over the corpse. then she stands to see that 
john is waiting for her. he holds out his hand, she takes it and 
follows the others.
