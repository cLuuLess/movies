55	ext. the clearing - day

the red coat zombies, shuffling forward abreast in a line, have 
opened fire. it's a grisly parody of foot-soldiering. the creatures 
are unsteady on their feet, their hands shake when they squeeze the 
stiff army-issue triggers. bullets fly this way and that, most of 
them grossly off target.

rhodes
that's it, you worm-eaten slime ! you foul-
smelling, puss-faced maggots! i told you 
i'd find you real action, didn't i? you 
corruption! you filth! you're learning! 
you're getting better....getting 
better...getting better, you scum!

the trooper beside toby is another young man whose nickname is 
tricks. he and toby exchange glances as they trudge along behind the 
captain and his zombie red coats. their eyes tell us that they both 
think rhodes to be insane, which of course he is.
