82	int. the dormitory - night

mary henried and julie grant have entered through a steel door with 
electronic locks. the zombies send up a chorus of moans and growls. 
the women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. 
suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into 
a cell marked "samson!".

samson is nibbling on another head. much of the flesh is already 
gone, but we can still recognise...chico. the zombie turns the thing 
up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out 
grey matter.

julie backs away, fighting nausea. a spasm rises in mary's stomach as 
well and she reels away from the hideous sight.

rhodes
come, come, miss science. you've seen 
worse.

mary
god....damn you, rhodes!

rhodes
god has damned us all. are my atrocities 
worse than yours?

mary
you have ruined weeks of work here! we've 
been trying to wean these specimens onto 
alligator meat!

rhodes
no wonder they're so....hungry.

suddenly julie screams, her hands flying to her mouth.

the plastic bag is still dangling from rhodes' gloved hand. inside, 
pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of the 
final head. the thing is squirming causing the whole bag to wiggle.

rhodes drops the bag instantly to the floor. taking care, he grabs 
the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. the head rolls out 
and settles against a wall. it's eyes are open and darting crazily, 
its mouth is chewing, grotesquely, on the air.

mary stares in shock. julie runs towards the exit, trying to scream 
but gagging on her own acids. she's hysterical.

rhodes calmly draws his pistol, cocks, and fires. the squirming head 
is shattered by the powerful bullet.
