169	ext. a beach on the island - morning

tricks' body lies covered in the sand. the refugees are gathered 
again, heads bowed, while john speaks.

john
satan ain't sent this man back. not yet, 
anyway. so we all hopin' that maybe he's up 
there with you, lord. this might be the 
first decent soul we been able ta offer ya 
in quite a few years. that's a fact. we 
just gonna... pray, lord. we gonna pray 
that what seems ta be happenin' here...is 
really happenin'...and i'm gonna take the 
chance and speak these words that i ain't 
been able ta speak for so long...

may he rest in peace

the others
amen.
