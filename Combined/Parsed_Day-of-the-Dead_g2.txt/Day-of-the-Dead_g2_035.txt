35	ext. the jungle near the inlet - day

thwock! close on a machete. the blade chops into the top of a 
coconut.

chico drinks the milk. sarah sits on a nearby rock, her rifle and a 
back-pack full of supplies strapped over her shoulders.

miguel, his madman's eyes wide with excitement, is trotting urgently 
from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant 
grows. there are hundreds of them, six-feet tall and flowering. their 
red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells 
down.

miguel
datura!!! datura!!! mira. datura!!!

chico
what's he saying?
	
sarah shrugs, not knowing. chico looks down at her, empathising.

chico
his madness....could be from shock.

sarah
no. i didn't stop the infection in time. i 
know.
(she speaks softly, matter-of-factly)
don't worry. when he dies, i won't be like 
maria. i'll shoot him.

miguel
datura!!! datura!!! datura metel!!!
