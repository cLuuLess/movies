72	ext.	the clearing - day

rhodes grins as he watches the spectacle.

suddenly, a loud gunshot startles the captain. he drops the 
binoculars and spins around. he sees...

...chico's body dangling on the rope. chico's head is bloody. he's 
dead...and won't come back to life. he's been shot through the brain.

rhodes
who fired that shot? who fired that shot?

soldiers stand around dumbly. those with rifles in their hands 
quickly sling them onto their shoulders. they're all afraid of the 
captain's wrath. rhodes walks towards the line of men with fury in 
his eyes.

rhodes
goddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who 
fired that shot or i'll have every last one 
of you chopped up for feed!!!

his eyes spot toby, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his 
rifle slung.

rhodes
step up here, tyler.

toby
sir!

toby shouts the word like a west point cadet and he bravely steps 
forward. rhodes stares him down, his anger turning sinister.

rhodes
you fired that shot, didn't you?

toby
no, sir.

rhodes
let me see your weapon.

toby hands over his rifle. rhodes feels the barrel, sniffs it.

rhodes
it's been fired.

toby
in the battle, sir.

rhodes is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out 
to be his favourite whipping boy. his body relaxes visibly.

rhodes
it may be that none of these chicken-shits 
will talk while the whole troop is 
present...but i know some of these men 
well. i'm sure that a few private 
conversations will tell me what i already 
know. you may have earned yourself some 
time in the stalag, tyler.
(rhodes glances over at chico's body)
cut him down. that's another head for you 
to chop off. leave it with the others. take 
the rest of his body down to the freezers. 
move it, shit hill.

toby moves off. rhodes' grin returns.
