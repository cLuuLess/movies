54	ext. the jungle near the clearing - day

their cover blown, sarah now raises her rifle. buddabudda!!!

the second zombie's head turns to red pulp and the thing pitches 
forward, dead.

chico fires and the third zombie is destroyed.

suddenly there is distant fire, from the clearing. bullets whiz 
through the brush. the guerilleros duck for cover.
