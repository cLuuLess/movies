39	ext. the cave entrance - day

chico is at the edge of a clearing when sarah reaches him. his eyes 
are wide, frightened by what they see.

in the ground before them there's an enormous iron plate, fifty feet 
by ten, all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns.

sarah
what is it?

chico
i dunno. landing pad for a helicopter? i 
dunno.

suddenly there's a great rumbling, like the giant gears and pistons 
of a drawbridge being activated. the iron plate shudders and starts 
to move, downward, into the earth. sarah and chico duck into the 
nearby jungle.
