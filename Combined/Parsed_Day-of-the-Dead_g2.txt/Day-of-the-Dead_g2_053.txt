rhodes hears the gunfire. he seems pleased. he grins.

rhodes
we have visitors. let's go men.

he moves slowly towards the thicket followed by toby tyler and 
several other soldiers. he reaches down to his belt and pushes one of 
three buttons on a unit that resembles a pager. electronic beeps, 
like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a 
different pattern.

the red coat zombies respond quickly. they draw their pistols and go 
marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull 
apes. rhodes' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.

rhodes
hah! if only the rest of you ladies would 
obey orders the way they do.
