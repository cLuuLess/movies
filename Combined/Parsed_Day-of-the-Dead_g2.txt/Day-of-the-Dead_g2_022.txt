22	ext. the private dock - day

sarah is crying. it's not weakness. she's crying for miguel, crying 
for his pain. but she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. she 
crouches over the bitten arm and raises the machete over her head.

thuck! she chops at the elbow joint with all her strength. the blade 
bites deep but doesn't cut through. she lifts it and chops again and 
again....thuck! thuck! then she digs around, searching for the joint 
the way she might on a turkey drumstick. finding the spot, she pushes 
down with both hands, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the 
blade. tears are running down her cheeks when the big knife 
finally.... thummmppp!....cuts through to the decking.

repulsed, angry, sarah sweeps the severed forearm away with the blade 
the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. blood is spurting 
out of the stump at an alarming rate. sarah has to act quickly again.

while chico continues to return fire at the enemy, sarah swings 
herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears 
inside the place.
