107	int. storage bay in the hospital - morning

creak! a crowbar pries open a crate. john and lukey guard the 
entrance while toby and diesel work at opening the "red cross" boxes. 
sarah stands nearby. the lids lift and we see two army-issue life 
rafts.

toby
there ya go. complete with air 
canisters...little motors.

john
we got a boat.

toby
what?

john
i say we got a boat. can you get other 
stuff?

toby
i got some fuel comin' out and, i hope, 
some automatic rifles.

diesel
he's just tryin' to win us over. this 
doesn't prove anything.

john
i'm gonna trust him, diesel. he already 
knows who we are and we ain't got a bunch 
o' time to mess around with rhodes shootin' 
up the joint every mornin'.

toby, rooting through the open crates, finds the pistols tricks told 
him about and a few boxes of ammo. he tosses one of the guns to john. 
the big man walks over and puts the weapon back inside the crate.

john
can't walk around here with these. let's 
just leave 'em here 'til we ready ta use 
'em.
