21	ext. the private dock - day

sarah acts quickly. she lunges towards chico and snatches a machete 
out of his belt. chico shows concern but he's busy returning fire at 
the attackers on the trawler.

sarah
i have to stop the infection... querrida...
	
miguel looks into sarah's eyes. he has started to tremble. a cry of 
primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. with a sudden move, sarah 
slams her rifle butt into the side of his head with all her might. he 
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. his eyes roll but 
he stays on his feet, still conscious.

chico steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of 
miguel. whap! he slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. miguel 
still stands. whap! he slugs him again. whap! again. finally, miguel 
collapses into the man's arms and chico lays the limp body down on 
the deck.

buddablam! rattatattatattatatt! the enemy, sensing an upper hand, 
starts firing with more intensity. chico steps away from miguel and 
sends some lead back their way.
