119	int. the communication room - night

close on: a blinking rectangle of red light. written on its face is: 
alarm - gate 7. a bell rings loudly in the room. the shot widens and 
we see five men, all slumped, unconscious, none able to react to the 
alarm.

one of the security guards has made it to the exit. he manages to 
push the door open, but then he falls in a heap.

a radio man staggers into a webbing of wires, then he too falls.

the other security guard inches his hand towards a lever with a 
protective cover. he flips the cover up, then collapses. the falling 
action causes his fingers to trip the lever. a huge klaxon sounds. a 
blinking rectangle, huge over the doors, reads: general alert!
