37	ext. a swampy area - day

alligators lurk and snakes slither among the reeds. a fourteen foot 
gator opens its jaws wide making a sound like escaping steam. chico 
draws his pistol but sarah reaches out to grab his hand.

sarah
no. no shooting. not until we're sure we're 
alone on this island.

miguel
no. no, thank you. no ice. straight up, 
please. no ice. thank you.

miguel's eyes roll up into his head. his knees buckle. sarah grabs 
him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the 
muddy swamp water. chico comes to help.
