4	ext. the city - day

close on a section of pavement as we hear the sound of sluggish 
footsteps approaching. a shadow appears at the bottom of the frame. 
it gets longer and takes on the shape of a man.

tight on the afternoon sun, blinding us. into the foreground lurches 
the figure which cast the shadow. glare obscures all facial detail 
until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball 
in the sky. then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, 
the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped 
away. this is a zombie! a music chord sounds and the main title 
appears:

day of the dead
