57	ext. the clearing - day

two of the red coats are hit, but not in the head. their brains keep 
functioning and they march on.
	
rhodes
spread out, men! open fire!

whatever else he is, rhodes seems fearless. he stands in the open as 
his human soldiers fan out. he notices that the red coats are out of 
ammunition. he pushes another button on his belt unit and more beeps 
sound. the red coats stop in their tracks. they dump the spent shells 
from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts. 
their fingers are stiff. three bullets fall to the ground for every 
one that finds its way into a gun chamber.

the soldiers have opened fire now. they are closing in on the 
thicket.
