the mysterious platoon begins "setting up" their equipment, which 
includes tripod machine guns. two men don black rubber gloves and 
long black laboratory aprons. they strap large refrigerated cartons 
around their necks and open the sealed lids. vapour mushrooms out 
like dry-ice vapour out of good humour wagons on a hot day.
