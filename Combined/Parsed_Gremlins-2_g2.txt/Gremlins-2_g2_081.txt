          139 int. xerox room 139

          in the same xerox room where he was tormented with the copying
          machine and the rubber cement, gizmo is undergoing his worst
          torture yet at the hands of george and mohawk, who have lit
          censers and put on inquisition-style robes for the occasion.
          the defenseless gizmo is tied with heavy twine to the top of a
          paper-cutting table. above him, george hangs by one arm from a
          high shelf. in his other claw, george holds a pendulum rigged
          up from a t-square, a protractor, rubber bands...

          .and a gleaming-sharp ex-acto knife. as george swings the
          pendulum, the knife blade moves closer to gizmo's chest, a
          fraction of an inch each time.
          pacing back and forth on the floor below, mohawk cackles at
          gizmo's dilemma. like a villain swilling whiskey, he gulps from
          the vial he stole in the genetics lab, the one with the spider
          logo on it.
          the blade moves closer-grazing gizmo's fur...but as it
          slices the topmost fibers of the twine that holds him
          down --
           -- a change comes over gizmo's expression. this is one mogwai
           who's had enough. he sets his jaw in angry determination, and
           bursts the frayed twine, freeing one arm -- then another --
           george grabs the t-square like a scythe, and tries to hack at
          gizmo with the knife blade --
          -- but gizmo grabs the pendulum and pulls down hard, so that
          george tumbles from his shelf --

          -- and lands on mohawk. before the gremlins can get to their
          feet, gizmo scrambles down from the table --
