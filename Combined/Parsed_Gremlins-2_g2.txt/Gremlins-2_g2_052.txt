          84 int. systems control center 84

           as forster fumes, the systems control technicians have an amused
           discussion of the gremlin "rules" as explained by billy.

           technician i
           okay, wait -- what if one of them
           eats something at eleven o'clock,
           but he gets something stuck in his
          teeth --

           technician 2
           a caraway seed.

           technician 1
           whatever, right, and then after
           twelve o'clock, it comes out --
           now, he didn't eat that after
          midnight --

          (continued)

          


          billy
          look i didn't make the rules.
          there are --

          forster
          "the rules." i can't believe this.


           technician 2
           or what about if he's eating in an
           airplane, and they cross the time
          zone --
           but the technician's theory is cut short, as --
          -- two green arms burst out of his console, ripping aside
          control buttons and speaker grilles in a burst of sparks and

          smoke.
          before the technician can move, the arms are going for his
          throat -- and mohawk, now a bloodthirsty gremlin, emerges from
          the wreckage of the console, still choking the technician.

           technician 2 (cont.)
          help -- me --
           at the sight of mohawiï¿½rster jumps back. technician 1 tries
           to move on the gremli 34o awk takes a claw from his
           victim's neck and slashes a ian 1's arm, driving him back.
           billy pulls out his building-shag plight and shines it at
           the gremlin. recoiling, the gremlin s go of the technician,
           who falls to the floor -- dead.
