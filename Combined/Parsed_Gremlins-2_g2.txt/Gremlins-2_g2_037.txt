          65 int. clamp centre - lobby

          the lobby clock is at two minutes to midnight. there's lively
          action at the lobby's bars, dance floor, and frozen yogurt
          stand, where two teenage yogurt jerks serve customers.

          0 i'm not sure...alexis, are the
          peanut butter cups all natural?
          as yogurt jerk 2 joins the discussion, a new angle finds a furry
          paw turning on two spigots on the yogurt machine. follow the
          two streams of goo over the machine's spill grate and down to
          the floor. hidden from view by the counter, mohawk, george, and
          lenny reach for the trickling yogurt...
          .check the lobby clock as the time ticks past midnight...

          lenny

          .and sloppily chow down. up above, yogurt jerk i turns to the
          machine, sees the two spigots flowing. she's about to turn them
          off, but a complaining customer stops her.

          customer 2

           but then customer 2 and yogurt jerk 2 see it at the same time: a
           furry paw reaching up to scoop m&m's from a topping bin.

           customer 2
