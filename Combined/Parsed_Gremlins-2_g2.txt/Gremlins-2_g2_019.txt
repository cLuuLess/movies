          billy
          you should run some of the
          classics, fred -- ffankenstein,
          dracula ...

          grandpa fred
          all the great horror movies are in
          black and white. mister clamp only
          likes color. that guy is
          str___._. ange.

          billy
          you've seen him?

          grandpa fred
          well, of in person, but --
          just to this building. you

          week, they took out a patent on a
          new kind of gerbil. people think
          ia creepy.

          billy
          well -- i wanted to get away from
          kingston falls. i guess i did.

          grandpa fred
          you. got that right, kid. have you
          heard these voices they have here
          now? don't look at me like that.
          you know that white noise they play
          all the time? the static?

          billy
          yeah. that's so they can put
          people close together and they
          won't overhear each other. you're
          not supposed to notice it.

          grandpa fred
          sure. but if you listen to it --
          there are little voices in there.

          0
          you can almost hear what they're
          saying, but not really. that's a
          horror movie -- the building that
          wuldn't shut tln.

          z3 int. systems control center 23

          the clamp centre's "nerve center" looks like an air traffic
          control tower: technicians hunch over meters, monitors, and
          switches, tracking the building's systems.
          forster comes in and walks past several technicians, looking
          over their shoulders. one computer monitor tracks the
          elevators' movements, while others give spy-camera views of
          employees in corridors, bathrooms, etc.
          forster talks to a technician who mans controls labelled "white
          noise" and "voice."

          forster
          let me hear the voices.
          the technician brings up voices on a speaker. they sound like
          voice-overs on slick tv commercials.

          forster turns to see a technician pointing at a monitor showing
          clamp's face. forster greets the screen.

          forster
          yes, mister clamp.

          forster turns and looks over a technician's shoulder at a
          monitor. a spy camera shows a stressed-out employee lighting a
          cigarette in a storeroom.

          source of the voice.
