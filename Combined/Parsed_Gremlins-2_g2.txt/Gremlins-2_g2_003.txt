          3 ext. street 3

           pedestrians dodge a long black limousine as it pulls up short.
           angle reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- going out of business signs and boarded-up windows.
           forster, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy men, also in suits. the three
           big men take a big-screen tv vt and a vcr out of the car.
