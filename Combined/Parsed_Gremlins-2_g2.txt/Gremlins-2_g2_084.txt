          142 ext. clamp plaza building 1s2
          two fire engines have pulled up outside the building. as
          firemen connect their hoses to hydrants, cops push the crowd
          back to clear a path to the door for the firemen.
          as the breathless futtermans arrive at the building, they see a
          tv newsperson interviewing the nearly hysterical microwave marge
          beside the door.

          marge
          .and, and then these horrible
          green things came into the kitchen,
          and they, they put all kinds of
          metal utensils and cookingware into
          the units, the ovens, which you
          should never, it's not like your
          conventional oven, it produces a, a
          reaction, and it explode!d, and the
          horrible things were, they were
          laughing, and --
          hearing this, mr. futterman pushes his way to the entrance and
          blocks the firemen's path.
