          grandpa fred
          .tonight we've got a classic
          horror movie, from grandpa fred's
          special dungeon --
          fred is interrupted by a moan -- not the normal weak moan on
          the tape, but a genuinely scary gremlin moan.
          he turns around, and sees a grinning gremlin emerge from behind
          the prop tombstone. as fred heads back there, two other
          gremlins join the first one, and the three of them watch him
          intently.

           director (o.s. )
           fred, what's the story with those
          -- things?

           grandpa fred
          uh.. .i don't...
          one of the gremlins takes the reel of film from fred, unreels
          a little from the loose end and holds it up. a second gremlin
          looks at a frame -- mimes terrified shock, then clutches his
          chest and falls back onto the floor. the of e%.gremlins laugh.

           no
          uh -- that ' s right, it ' s real '
          scary --
           the other two gremlins put their f alongside fred's and make
          scary snarls. they like it here

          director (o.s.)
          boy, that's creepy. okay,
          rolling...

          grandpa fred
          uh -- grandpa fred and his friends
          have something horrible in store
          for you tonight...
           the gremlins nod in gleeful agreement.
