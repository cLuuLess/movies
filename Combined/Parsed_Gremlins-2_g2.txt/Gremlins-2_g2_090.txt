          billy is blinking himself groggily to consciousness, seeing the room through
          the blur of concussion. there's an unpleasant, whining noise --
          -- as billy sees daffy, now in dentist's whites, revving up the high-speed
          drill and moving in on him. daffy's face mask doesn't hide his goofy, eager

          eyes --
          billy flails desperately, but it just leaves his mouth unprotected. daffy
          wedges a claw in, moves in with the drill ---

          just before the drill can make contact, billy and daffy turn to
          see mr. futterman coming quickly toward them from the doorway.
          daffy turns on him with the drill, aiming for his chest --
          -- but mr. futterman reaches overhead, turns on the bright
          castle lamp, and aims it at daffy -- who shrieks, drops the
          drill, and runs from the dentist's office.

          mr. futterman
          you okay, billy?

          billy
          yeah. mr. futterman, what are you
          doing here?
