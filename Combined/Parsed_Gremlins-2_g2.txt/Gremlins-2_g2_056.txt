          9 2a int. clamp's outer office 92a

          -- where he finds the gremlin, wearing the secretary's pink
          sweater, sitting in her chair and typing at her computer.

          you're not my secretary.
          the gremlin responds by grabbing a silex pot of boiling-hot
          water from the nearby coffee station, and flinging the boiling
          water at clamp --
          -- who ducks it, as it scalds the paint on the wall behind him.
          clamp makes a tentative move toward the gremlin, who throws the
          empty silex. it barely misses clamp, and smashes against the
          wall.
          the gremlin jumps at clamp, who tries to bat it away from his
          face, like a kid panicked by a moth --
          -- but his flailing knocks the gremlin back, so that its foot is
          caught in the hopper of the secretary's shredder. hating to do
          it, using only his fingertips, clamp pushes the struggling
           gremlin down into the machine --
           -- which sprays him out of the bottom like a black, bloody,
           eyes-only memo of deatu.
           as clamp stands gasping Â®de the machine, the door to the
           corridor opens, and billlybu in. he sees the shredder, and
          0 the tattered gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it.

          sir -- are you all right?

          clamp
          i think so..-.i hate using these
          machines myself.

          sir, i have to talk to you. there

          the door opens again, and a dishevelled forster bursts in.

          forster
          mister clamp, there's a situation
          in --

          sir, please listen to me. there
          are more of these things -- maybe
          lots more. we've got to get people
          out of the building -- and we've
          got to close the building up.
          we've got to do it before sundown.

          these -- things can't stand
          sunlight. it'll kill them. but
          once it's night time, they can get
