          in this closer look, we see that many of the plants and animals
          in the lab are hooked up to mysterious gadgets.
          catheter goes over to wally, a white-coated scientist. the
          fluorescent lights over wally's area are flickering.

          dr. catheter
          hello, wally. your lights are
          flickering again.

          wally's eyes are blinking in precise synch with the flickering
          of the fluorescent bulbs.

          wally
          are they?
          dr. catheter turns to a table where several different potted
          vegetable plants are att ed to collecting tubes that feed into
          a central glass vial.
          dr. cafter
          how are we doing on a vegetable
          medley plant, wally talked to
          the bird's-eye peopl ain.
          they're very excited .
          wally nods, sighing -- the long-sgff ring researcher.

          wally
          we came close yesterday, doctor.
          but it rejected the pimento.

          dr. catheter
          you'll get it, wally.

          wally
          i'm very pleased about this bat
          project, though...
          he leads catheter toward a group of animal cages,

          wally (cont.)
          you know, in some parts of the 
          world, there are millions of bats. 
          they could make terrific 
          messengers, like pigeons...

          dr. catheter 
          yes, but they only come out at 
          night. 

          wally 
          that's what we're working on, sir. 
           they arrive at a cage where a resting bat hangs upside down. an
           intravenous tube, sticking out of the bat's flesh, is connected 
          to a drip bottle whose label bears a shining sun logo. 

          wally (cont.)
          this is a formula of vitamins,

          0
          hormones, and french sunblock. 
          soon, he'll be totally desensitized 
          to bright light. watch --

          wally flips a switch, and a bright sunlamp shines on the bat.
          the little creature stretches luxuriously, warming itself in the
          rays, like a basking cat.

          dr. catheter
          very nice.
          catheter draws closer to wally, and speaks with creepy

          fascination:

          dr. theter (cont.}
          i believe sow them feed
          on...ï¿½gï¿½. %

          wally
          oh, uh -- that's fferent bat,
          doctor. south amen.

          dr. cathbtf "

          (disappointed)
          ah. well, good work, lly...
          catheter moves on. another scientist approaches wally in b.g.

          scientist
          0 wally, could you let me have some
          growth hormone? i'm a little
          short.
          follow catheter to another side of the lab, where two more
          scientists are at work. one of them (lewis) greets catheter,
          while the other (martin) has his back to us at the moment.

          dr. catheter (cont.)
          hello, lewis.

          lewis
          hi, doctor.

          dr. catheter
          how's that cloning work coming?
          martin turns around. he is lewis's identical twin.

          martin
          r r e l_ well, doctor.
          the twins talk in rapid e nation, as if they share a brain.
          lewis t a
          say, doctor, look at

          martin
          .i think you'll find it
          interesting.
          following the sound of the crooning that caught the messenger's
          attention, they take catheter over to a lab table where the
          lights are lowered above a covered cage. martin pulls back the
          cloth to reveal gizmo, who stops singing and looks up at them.

          lewis
          some sort of rodent, apparently...

          martin
          .and it can't take bright light.

          lewis
          watch this, doctor.
          he opens the side door of gizmo's cage and turns on a tape
          player. hearing the bouncy rock music, gizmo playfully dances
          out of the cage as the scientists talk.

          dr. catheter
          hmp! qu-te, isn't he?

          martin
          that may be genetic...

          lewis
          .we're not sure yet.
          but as he amuses his captors, gizmo is slyly looking around for
          a way out of here. he edges farther away from the cage...

          dr. catheter
          not so fast, pal.
          he abruptly switches the music off, and grabs gizmo just before
          the mogwai can make good his escape. dr. catheter sticks the
          frightened gizmo back in the cage, and shuts the side door
          firmly.

          dr. catheter (cont.)
          what's wrong with you two? he
          almost made a break for it.

          martin
          sorry, sir

          dr. catheter
          how are you going to pro, with

          and then there's body structure.
          and for that, my little friend...
          the three scientists loom over the terrified gizmo. dr.
          catheter reaches into the cage to give gizmo a poke.

          dr. catheter (cont.)
          .we'll just have to cut you.
