          155 int. corridor - kate and marla as before 15=

           mohawk moves toward the women with a spider's predatory
           nimbleness, quickly closing the distance. kate and marla run
           as fast as they can --
           -- too fast to notice that the corridor before them is strung
           with more webs. the sticky filament catches them -- and, as
           they writhe desperately, mohawk, smiling, clambers toward them
           for the kill -- when, suddenly --
          a vent in the ceiling clatters open, and gizmo drops from it,
          falling to a display case on the wall between the spider and its
          prey. he wears a black headband, and carries a homemade weapon
          -- a bow made from the paper clip and rubber band, and a wooden
          match as an arrow.

          gizmo sees his enemy menacing kate and marla. grim
          determination shows on his face, as he hears in his mind:

          sylvester stallone (v.0. )
          to survive a war, you've got to
          become war.
          holding the drawn bow and arrow in front of him, he pivots on
          the display case, so that the match scratches against the wall,
          and catches fire --
          -- and, as billy and mr. futterman round the corner, they see
          gizmo loose the arrow --
          -- which catches spider-mohawk in mid-body. the flames spread
          over his body and to his hairy legs as he writhes, tumbles over,
          and dies.
          billy rushes to cut the women free with a pocket knife, as mr.
          futterman looks at gizmo, up on the display case.

          mr. futterman
          what's that?

          billy
          0 that's gizmo, mister fu tprtt
          he's on our side.
          mr. futterman gives gizmo a hand down from the display case.

          mr. futterman
          (to gizmo)
          uh...thanks.
          gizmo responds with a quick, stallone-style nod, as kate and
          billy embrace.

          kate
          billy --
          (indicates gizmo)
          what happened to him?

          billy
          i guess they -- pushed him too far.

          billy
          thank god you're okay.

          well -- gizmo got wet, and then the
          mogwais ate after midnight, and
          then some of the gremlins must have
          mutated, from the genetic material.

          marla
           (thinks: huh?)
          oh.

          billy
          and if these things get out of here
          now --

          mr. futterman
          we'll stop 'em, billy. i'll tell
          you something -- ever since these
          guys attacked us, back in kingston
          fails, i've been scared it would
          happen again. but now that it
          happened...i'm_not seared.

          screwy, huh? but you know, billy
          -- the most important part of
          "american" is those last four
          letters: "i can." washington
          didn't give up...lincoln didn't

          mr. futterman

          kate
          i'm sorry, it's -- lincoln's
          birthday. something terrible
          happened on lincoln's birthday one
          year, and ever since then...
