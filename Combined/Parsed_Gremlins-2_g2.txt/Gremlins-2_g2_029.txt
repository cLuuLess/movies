          billy returns to his cubicle, the restless tool box still in
          hand. he opens a drawer in his desk, slips gizmo inside.

          billy (cont.)
          gizmo, you've got to be quiet. you
          don't want to go back to that

          billy is interrupted by someone gasping sharply beside him, and
          he realizes that all noise and conversation around him have
          ceased. he quickly slams his desk drawer shut, almost squashing
          gizmo's paw --
          -- and looks up to sef' one staring as daniel clamp, with
          two bodyguards, walks do ï¿½e row of cubicles. no one can
          quite believe that the tyc on here in the flesh.

          here, if there's anything i can --

          clamp
          that's okay. everybody just relax,
          and go back to what you'd be doing
          normally. i know i haven't been
          down here before, but that's going
          to change. i'm going to be a
          little more "hands-on" with these
          operations from now on...
          as he speaks, clamp glances over billy's shoulder, and spots the
          chinatown drawing.

          marla watches, saucer-eyed, as clamp shakes hands with billy.

          clamp
          that's what we need here. people

          people think "elm," they think

          gizmo's drawer rattles open. billy snaps it shut.

          huh. i didn't know about that one.
          he moves on, nodding vaguely at marla -- who goes over to billy,
          looking at him through completely new eyes.

          gizmo ducks back out of sight ...but, a moment later, a chain of
