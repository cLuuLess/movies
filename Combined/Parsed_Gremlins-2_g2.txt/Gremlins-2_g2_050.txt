          billy and kate come breathlessly through the lobby doors. they
          find the businesses mostly open -- and a sea of people pouring
          through the doors, innocently arriving for work.

           he hands kate a couple of flashlights as they start back across
           the lobby.

           light. if one of them gets near
           you --
          he's interrupted as marla comes up to them -- and gives billy a
          squeeze and a kiss before he has time to think.

          marla
          good morning, billy. that was so
          aim, last night. we're going to

          terrific.
          as billy heads for the elevators, hold on a nearby miller's
          outpost jeans store that opens onto the lobby. a couple of
          teenage girl shoppers approach the sales clerk.

          shopper
          excuse me...do you have any styles
          that aren't, urn, fringed?
          they hold up several pairs of pants. all of them are "fringed"
          from the knees down -- as if they'd been clawed to tatters.
          from the store's back room, we hear a whoop. it's familiar, but
          the voice has become deep, raspy, and such less innocent.

           daffy (o.s.)
           wa- !
