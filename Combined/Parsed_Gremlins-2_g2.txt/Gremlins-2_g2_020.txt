          24 int. genetics lab - reception area 24

          with its cheerful wall sign reading splice-o-life inc., this
          reception area seems normal, except for the animal noises that
          drift in from the back rooms.
          a messenger with a package, finding no one at the rception
          desk, goes past it, into an inner corridor...

          .to the fringe of a laboratory so high-tech it makes the rest
          of the building look down-home. as he looks into the lab,
          peering curiously at scientists, gadgets, potted plants and
          caged animals, his attention is captured by a sound from the
          0 back -- gizmo's song, in that sad minor key.
          half-consciously, the messenger picks up the melody, and starts
          whistling it to himself -- until peggy, the lab's receptionist,
          comes over to his.

          there, anyway?

          it.

          peggy's got a bad case of the sniffles -- she blows her nose as
          she signs the paperwork and hands it back.

          messenger
          okay. this copy's yours. thanks.
          whistling gizmo's tune again, the messenger leaves the office
          -- almost running into dr. catheter, splice-o-life's chief
          scientist, who's on his way in.

          peggy
          doctor catheter, this just came
          for you.

          dr. catheter
          (taking package)
          oh, good. this might be my
          malaria...
          (opening package)
          no, this is just rabies. i have
          rabies. and i was supposed to get
          the flu this week.

           she takes out a kleenex, blows he(;z>nose again. dr. catheter
          holds his hand out. q

           dr. cathete 
           may i have that, peg

           peggy q)
          oh, uh -- sure...
          dr. catheter takes the kleenex, and heads for the inner office.

          dr. catheter
          (shakes his head)
          back order. all a man wants is
          some fresh germs...
          follow catheter back to
