          ext. new york streets (times square area) - morning

          the outright madness of new york at rush hour. herds of workers
          push past vendors, hookers, 3-card monte artists, etc.
          camera settles on billy peltzer and his girlfriend kate, heroes
          of the gremlin siege of kingston falls. though they're a few
          years older now, billy and kate are still small-town types, who
          keep getting elbowed aside by the sidewalk crowd. billy wears
          business clothes, and kate is in a uniform-type skirt and
          blazer. spot universal price code-type bar codes on the chest
          of billy's sportscoat and kate's blazer.

          i should be finished by six
          tonight. if we go straight from
          work, we can make the early bird
          special at the movies.

          billy
           it's going to be close. maybe we
           could do it tomorrow -- no,
           tomorrow's when the futtermans are

          s
          coming to town.

          kate
          mister futterman must be getting
          better, if he can travel.

          billy
          his wife says he's getting better.
          he's just been -- rattled.

          kate
          i guess having a bunch of monsters
          drive a snow plow through jour
          living room could kind of that
          to you. he almost got kied.

          billy
          right.
