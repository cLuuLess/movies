          billy goes through a small anteroom and a second door, into the
          bathroom, where he leans against the door, catching his breath.
          he starts to lift the cover on the cage, then remembers to turn
          the lights down. he lifts the cover --
          a boy and his mogwai! emotions flood over their faces --
          recognition, relief, shared secrets and memories. billy props
          the cage on a sink, takes gizmo out.

          billy
          hey, guy...did you miss me?
          gizmo does eye movements -- shyly hedging, then admitting it.

          billy (cont.)
          yeah, me too. let's put you up
          here. we don't want to get any
          water on you.

          gizmo shrinks back, terrified.

           billy (cont.)
           that bad, huh? how did you get in
           there? what happened to mister
          wing?
          gizmo looks sad -- indicates his armband.

           billy (cont.)
          oh. i'm sorry. but then --
           he stops at a sudden sound -- voices in the anteroom between the
          bathroom and the hail.

           billy (cont.)
          quick -- get in here.
           he slips gizmo into the tool box, above his protesting twitters.

           billy (cont.)
          sshh -- just wait a minute --

          billy sets about furiously washing his hands, just as forster
          comes into the bathroom. billy doesn't see him standing there,
          until he shakes water off his hands --

          forster
          you're wetting my shoes, peltzer.
          billy sees forster, sees the shoes, grabs a paper towel and is
          about to drop to his knees.

          billy
          i'm sorry, sir -- let me --

          forster
          stand up, peltzer. come with me.
          billy grabs the tool box and follows forster out the door. as
          they go into the anteroom, forster's clipboard-carrying
           assistant joins them. #
