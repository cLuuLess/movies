          there are ... creatures in the
          building. they start out as these
          small, furry animals, but then they
          eat, and they go into cocoons, and
          then they become small, green --

          forster
          this is drugs. it's got to be.
          you're on a groovy little trio,
          aren't you, peltzer? well, let me
          tell you something, mister flower
           child --

           billy
           just listen to me --

           technician
           wait a mo. this is good. they
           start out rr d then they have
           the cocoons... v

           technician 2
           well, sure. you're going into a
           cocoon, you want to have a little
           something first.

          83a int. cable tv studios 83a

          looking around apprehensively, kate leads her tour group into
          the clamp cable tv operation. among her charges today is
          katsuji, a 20-year-old japanese tourist. katsuji is loaded down
          with an amazing arsenal of photography equipment: half a dozen
          still cameras with a ton of lenses, and a video camcorder.
          photographing the hell out of everything, he falls behind kate
          and the group.

          kate
          sir -- i'm sorry, but you have to
          keep up with the rest of the
          group...

       

          59a.
          katsuji responds by zooming in on kate with the video camera.

          katsuji
          excellent! thank you! please give
          me some right profile as you
          continue speaking!

          kate
          uh, if we're very quiet, we can go
          in here and watch a program being
          videotaped...

          83b int. microwave marge's set 83b

          as kate and her tourists quietly file into the studio, marge's
          cameraman tracks her to a counter, where she puts a tray of
          canapes down beside a casserole.

          marge
