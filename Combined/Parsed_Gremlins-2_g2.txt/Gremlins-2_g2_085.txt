          billy comes into clamp's office to find the tycoon pacing
          nervously.

          bill -- how's it going out there?
          any progress? just tell me there's
          progress.

          i'm afraid it's pretty bad right
          now, sir --

          clamp
          bad? it's horrible. there are
          people in this building. real
          lives. you have any idea what
          kind of lawsuits we're looking
          at here?

          billy
          yes sir. we'll have to
          but as he speaks, the electric gremlin emerges from a wall
          socket behind clamp...

          watch out!

          clamp turns to see the electric gremlin glide swims y through
          the air, coming straight at him --

          billy grabs the receiver of a video-phone end steps between
          clamp and the electric gremlin. at the last possible instant,
          he holds the receiver up in the electric gremlin's path. the
          glowing beast touches the mouthpiece...
          .disappears inside...and shows up an instant later on the
          video-phone's screen -- trapped, writhing in pain, as recorded
          voices bounce around it and issue from the phone's speaker.

          if you want to make a call, please

          sorry -- all circuits are busy
          now.,.

          billy
          he's in the phone system...on
          hold. that should take care of
          him for a while.

          the music begins: a cheery muzak rendition of "raindrops keep
          wallin' on my head." the electric gremlin writhes more
          fiercely, his pain doubled.

          clamp
          uh, bill -- thanks.

           billy
           sure. mister clamp, we have to
           stop these things from leaving
           the building. if they get out,
           that's it for new york -- at least
          new york.
          clamp nods gravely, and takes a videocassette from a drawer.

          clamp
          i thought this would never run,
          bill -- but maybe it will.

          as the montage continues, a tiffany-type pop singer sings a
          sprightly version of an old hymn:

          yet in my dreams i be

          clamp, watching, wipes away a tear.

          yes -- listen, sir, can you set the
          clocks in the building ahead three
          hours? all of them?

          clamp
          bill, there's nothing we can't do
          in this building. why?

          billy
          sunlight kills these things.
          that's why they're still in here.
          but when it's sundown -- or when
          they think it is -- they'll all get
          together in one place, so they can
          go out. they'll all be in the
          lobby.

          clamp
           right. that's the only way out --

          it's just an idea...you'll have to
