          forster and a security guard come down the rows of deserted
          cubicles. the guard has a mean-looking dog straining on a
          leash, sniffing at everything. as they near billy's cubicle,
          the dog starts sniffing excitedly.

          forster
          hah! good boy! i knew we'd find
          something in this guy's desk --
          -- but as they reach billy's desk, they find daffy's paint paw
          prints tracking crazily over every surface. the dog keeps going
          bananas, but it's not drugs he smells -- it's the dander of the
          recently departed daffy.
