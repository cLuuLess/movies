          billy said to make sure and feed
          you before midnight...
          as she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate, daffy
          spots a blender next to him. he recoils from it -- then, with
          an evil grin, he shoves it off the counter while kate's back is
          turned, breaking it. when she turns and looks, daffy has an
          innocent loops" expression on his face.

          kate
          oh, god-you have to be careful
          here, okay, gizmo? we don't have
          the money to replac things.

           let's see i f cwu ' l i eat this --
          daffy grabs a chick liï¿½g, opens his mouth as wide as joe e.
          brown's, clamps 0 -11 n the drumstick, and strips all the meat
          off in one fast ion, bringing out a spotless bone.
          with his other paw, daffy tries the mashed potatoes. he hates
          them, and pitches what he's holding, getting half the wad on
          kate and half on the refrigerator.

          you.
          daffy whoops, grabs more chicken, and resumes eating.
