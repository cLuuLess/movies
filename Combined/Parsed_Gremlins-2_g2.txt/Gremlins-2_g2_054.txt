          as the sound of a xerox machine in operation is heard o.s.,
          camera is close on the floor of a copying and office supply
          room, where a series of photocopies is piling up. the pictures
          are of gizmo -- his body pinned down, his face contorted in
          pain. each pose is slightly more tortured than the one before.
          new angle finds gizmo in the flesh --- he's fastened by a web of
          scotch tape to the document cover of a big copier. as gizmo
           struggles helplessly, re l mohawk at the controls, setting the
          machine for 100 copies.
           gizmo slides over the glas s ga 19i d again, wincing as he's hit
          by painful bursts of bright lag

          in the wake of mohawk's attack, the technicians are both somber
          and rattled. they work urgently at their consoles, as a
          panicked forster paces behind them, looking at their monitor
          screens.

          the peat infestation monitor...
          -- and sees, on the technician's screen, an alarmingly rapid
          proliferation of dots, spreading over the diagram of the
          building. the dots started as a cluster in the cable tv studio
          area -- microwave marge's studio -- but they're spreading out to
          other floors, and moving around quickly.
          forster is',

           a videophone rings near technician 3; he grabs it.
