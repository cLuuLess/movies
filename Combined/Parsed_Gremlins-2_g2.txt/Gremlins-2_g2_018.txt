          the run-down set of grandpa fred's house of horrors, a hosted-
          horror-movie show. billy comes in and stands behind the
          cameraman. grandpa fred, the guy who tried to talk to daniel
          clamp on the lobby tv hookup earlier, is an old trouper in a
          moth-eaten dracula outfit. he's giving the show his demoralized
          best shot.

          .tonight's movie is so scary
          -- the people who saw it when it
          came out in the theaters twelve
          years ago are just learning how
          to speak simple phrases and eat
          solid food again! that's right'.
          talk about scary' it's a good
          thing your grandpa fred is here
          with you --
          he waits for something he expected to hear, but it doesn't
          happen. he breaks character.

           where's the moan?

           grandpa fa
           the moan. there's posed to
           be a moan, from t ck, and i
           say, "oh, renfield, y a o u want some
           more flies, don't you," and i go
           back there and open the door --

           director (o.s.)
          oh. sorry, fred. can somebody
          find the tape with the moan?
          grandpa fred sits down, disgusted. billy goes over to him.

          billy
          hi, fred. hey, i was sorry to
          hear about your new time slot.
          i think they're making a big
          mistake.

          grandpa fred
          a mistake? kid. it's a disaster.
          people that watch tv at
          three-thirty in the morning are
          not scared of the wolfman. the
          only thing that scares those
          people is getting sober and
          finding work.

          billy
          yeah. i brought you something.

           billy reaches into his shopping bag, and pulls out a mechanized
          bat that flaps its wings as billy pulls the trigger. grandpa
          fred recoils.

          grandpa fred
          watch it with that thing.
          billy puts the bat on top of a cobwebbed tv set that's part of
          grandpa fred's set.

          billy
          i thought it would look good over
          here.

          grandpa fred
          frankly, kid, this was not what i
          had in mind. i went into
          broadcasting, i wanted to do news.
          public affairs. something
          meaningful.

          billy
          horror movies can be meaningful,
          fred. you should run some of the
          classics -- frankenstein,
          m a cula...

          s

          grandpa fred
          all the great horror movies are in
          black and white. mister clamp
          only likes color. i donky ven
          have a gimmick. no species
          effects. a puppet that c s out
          of a box -- whoopee.

          director (o.s.) o
          we've got the moan, fred.
          a listless, anemic moan is heard through the p.a.

          grandpa fred
          that's the moan?

          director (o.s.)
          that's what we've got, fred.
          and... rolling...
          grandpa fred gamely goes back into character.

          grandpa fred
           oh, renfield, you want some --

           lunch, everybody. sorry, fred.
           we'll pick it up right there.
