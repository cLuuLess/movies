          six stories underground, beneath the building and its parking
          floors. yellow lamps, set in a concrete wall along a catwalk
          ledge, cast an eerie half-light on kate and billy.

          it's along here...
           they come to a deep, square recess in the wall. inside is
          massive machinery -- pipes, pumps, meters -- surrounded by a

          chain-link cage.

           this is where the water comes into
          the building.

          great. maybe if we shut it off,
          they'll even close the place
          down...
          billy goes to a corner of the chain-link cage and starts bending
          links back from the seam, trying to make a big enough opening to
          slip through.
