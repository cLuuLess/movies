          a spokesman for developer daniel
          clamp says there's nothing to worry
          about, that these are just the
          normal "glitches" that a new

          customer 4 reaches under the salad bar's sneeze-guard with the
           plastic tongs to pull a clump of lettuce from the bin -- and is
          horrified to discover that he is holding an all-vegetable mutant
          gremlin by the ear. this horribly smiling thing has radishes
          for eyes, corn-row hair, cauliflower ears, stringbean lips and -
          - as it opens its mouth -- a darting wax-pepper tongue.
          as other customers recoil, horrified, customer 4 tries to drop
          the vege-gremlin, but, baring its sharp artichoke teeth, it
          reaches out with carrot fingers to grab his shirt and pull his
          through the sneeze guard.

          the gremlin points an accusing claw at the broker.

          nice tie!
          the broker starts yanking the tie off, but the gremlin swipes at
          him, and he beats it, as wider angle reveals a number of other
          gremlins also chasing brokers off, and grabbing their phones --

          gremlins
          (variously, on phones)
          buy! sell! sell! buy! sell!
          spot the brain hormone gremlin, kicked back in a broker's chair,
          talking on a phone.
