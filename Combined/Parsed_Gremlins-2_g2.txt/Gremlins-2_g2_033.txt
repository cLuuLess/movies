          56 int. canadian restaurant - night 56

          the restaurant is decorated in a canadian motif; the salt
          shakers are hollowed-out hockey pucks. camera finds a booth
          where marla, drinking jolt cola from a wine glass, is edging
          closer to billy, who's nursing a beer.

          marla
          did you always know you were going
          to be an artist?

          0 billy
           well -- i always liked to draw.
          when i was little, with my
          crayons, i would do these comic
          strips, and drawings of the
          teachers and stuff...

          marla
          i had crayons too, i y. and
          when i was four years old, i was
          using them to write dos to the
          other children. even then, i
          knew. c_j

          marla
          right. now, let's talk strategy.
          you realize, this changes
          everything -- for you, me, the
          department...

          billy
          what does?

          marla
          your relationship to mister clamp.
          your access. i can see a future,
          billy. i see more office
          space...embossed letterhead...i see
          us --
          (lowers her voice)
          -- swallowing up the publicity
          department.

          billy
          wow.
          i'm being open 4th billy.-
          haven't talked abqu feelings
          with anyone.

          billy
          see, i usually don't pay too much
          attention to office politics and
          stuff. i have so much work to do
          on the illustrations --

          marla
          you have talent, billy, and that's
          wonderful. it's a god-given
          blessing situation. but even an
          artist has to have goals.

          billy
          definitely. it's like i was saying
          to kate, i said, honey, you know,
          for an artist --
          maria leans closer to billy, her tone more intimate than before.

          marla
          i can help you reach those goals,
          billy. if we join forces...

          billy
          oh, we should definitely join --
          billy feels something in his lap. he looks down. it is marla's
          stockinged foot.

           -- forces.
          just at that moment --

           canadian waiter (0.s.)
          sir?
          -- a waiter appears at billy's side, holding a platter
          containing a large moose head sculpted out of chocolate. billy
          is so startled to find the moose staring at him that he spills
          his beer in his lap. maria quickly withdraws her foot, and
          billy blots at the spill with a napkin.

          canadian waiter (cont.)
          you okay there, sir? another
          molson there, eh?

          billy
          no, uh, thanks'. everything's fine.

          dessert, sir. e olate moose.

          as billy gets up from the booth, marla -- not giving up without
          a fight -- grabs his tie. the waiter steps back, and marla
          pulls billy down close to her, planting a kiss on his cheek,
          leaving a lipstick imprint. when billy slips loose, he finds
          the chocolate moose staring at him again.

          marla (cont.)
          -- see you tomorrow.

          billy
          good. right.
           he escapes the r au rant.
