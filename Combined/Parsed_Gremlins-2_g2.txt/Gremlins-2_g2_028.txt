          forster whips the bar-code reader wand out of his leatherette
          folder, runs it over billy's chest insignia again, and pushes a
          button in the folder. a calculator-type printout churns out of
          the gadget, and forster looks it over.

          forster

          (reading)
          lateness infractions... and these
          sat scores --

          billy
          (tries to see)
          that's in there?
          forster snaps the folder shut. gizmo, restless, rattles the
          tool box.

          forster
          what's in the box, peltzer?

          billy
           oh, uh -- art supplies.

           forster and his assistant, w ing billy leave.

          forster
          hm. i think our "random" drug
          search later on should be very
          interesting.
