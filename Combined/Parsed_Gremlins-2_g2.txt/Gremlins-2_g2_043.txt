          ext. police station - early morning 71

          a midtown precinct house. as billy and rate hurry out the front
          door, policemen in b.g. are leading a group of arrested street
          mimes from a paddy wagon toward the station. though in custody,
          the mimes continue their portrayals of walking against the wind,
          feeling up invisible wall , etc.

          when we get there -- go to your
          job, like normal, okay? and just
          keep your eyes open. what time
          is it?

          kate
