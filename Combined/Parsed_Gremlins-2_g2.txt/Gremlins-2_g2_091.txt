           she is still stuck in the web, struggling -- but suddenly she

           sees --
          kate rounding the corner of the corridor, flashlight in hand.

          marla
          thank god you're here...

          kate
          i could just leave you there. it
          seems to be good for your attitude.

          marla
          look -- about billy. nothing
          happened. really. i asked him to
          go out to dinner with me, but it
          was just business.

          okay. wait. i'm going to be
          honest with you. it'll be a
          cathartic openness thing. it
          wasn't business. i tried to get
          something going with him. but i
          couldn't get to first base. does
          that help?

          kate
          it'll do.
          she reaches into her purse, and pulls out a swiss army knife.
          but as she starts cutting marla down, marla sees something else,
           and screams --

          the hideous creature that once was mohawk, coming toward them.
          mohawk has the same head and torso he did before -- but his
          limbs are now eight fairy spider legs, stretching as wide and
          high as the corrido

          cut to:
