          aagghhh!
          when the guard pulls his head up, daffy is hanging onto the
          guard's nose by his teeth. the guard flails his head furiously
          around, until daffy finally flies free --

          billy
          no!
          -- and as the mogwai's departing footsteps are heard, the guard
          angrily puts billy up against the wall, starts handcuffing him.

           billy (cont.)
           we have to find him, before he eats
           something --

           billy looks around for kate then realizes she's hiding in the
          0 shadows of the concrete recess, unnoticed by the guard.

          billy
          look, we have to shut this building
          down. that thing that bit you --
          there are more of them, okay? and
          they're going to turn into -- these
          monsters, and --

          guard
          tell you what, pal -- you can tell
          the cops all about these monsters,
          i'm sure they'll be very
          interested...
          as he takes billy away, camera holds on a spot over their
          heads...goes into a gap between the concrete wall and
          ceiling ...and finds three big cocoons. their slimy bodies gleam
          dully in the yellow lamplight. as we watch, the cocoons
          silently grow and change, gathering strength...

          billy
          listen, i'm not crazy. people are
          going to be in a lot of danger.
          they wreck things. they kill
          people. if they get out of here,
          they'll destroy the whole
          city...they'll destroy everything.
          listen to me...
