          projector! they refuse to run the rest of
          the picture! they want to see snow white

          hulk hogan, in full wrestling regalia and carrying raisinets, comes over to
          join spielberg. spielberg points a finger upward -- toward the projection
          booth in our theater.
          hogan, quickly grasping the situation, addresses the gremlins in the booth.

          hulk hogan
