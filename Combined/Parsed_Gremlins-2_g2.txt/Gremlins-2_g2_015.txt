          the advertising department of daniel clamp's empire occupies
          modern, "open-plan" offices -- endless beige partitions form
          tiny cubicles full of "ergonomic" furniture. unseen speakers
          pipe in "white noise" -- low-volume static to insulate
          conversations.

          listen, this deadline. its not
          my fault. they're making me
          miserable so i have to make you
          miserable. it's a complete heart

           billy and marla a4lie at billy's cubicle, whose "work station" 
           consists of a dra g board and several drawers. the phone is
          equipped with a video screen. spot a small, struggling potted
          plant, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, billy's drawing of the
          main street of kingston falls.
          on billy's drawing board is an illustration of clamp's
          projected chinatown building -- _a l s monstrosity with insane
          pagoda touches. but billy has tried to breathe some' 3 e into
          it, wit r t the street, kids flying dragon kites, etc.
          marla looks over billy's shoulder at the drawing.

          40 there?

          right.
          he's about to sit down to work, when daniel clamp's lieutenant forster and
          his clipboard-carrying assistant come down the row of cubicles, looking
          around.

          marla
          hi, mister forster.
          forster nods at marla, runs an eye over billy's cubicle.

           as he speaks, forster opens a ï¿½therette folder and takes out a bar-code
           reading wand attached to the folder by curly cable. he runs the wand
           over the bar-code on billy's chest, and reads from an lcd display in the
          0 folder.

          aphid infestation.
          as forster's assistant jots on his clipboard, billy puts the plant in a desk
          drawer, and forster spots billy's drawing on his partition.

          forster
