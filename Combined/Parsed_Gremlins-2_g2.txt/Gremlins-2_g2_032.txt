           kate, walking toward bil 's cubicle, stops as she hears a
           piercing wolf-whistle, t her. she turns sharply, looks
           around , sees nobody --
           -- until her eyes light on a nearp j96 3 cabinet, where daffy
          hangs out of a drawer, ogling her.

          53a angle - gizmo in vent 53a
          gizmo, imprisoned in the vent, sees kate mistaking daffy for
          him. he shakes his head, twitters, points to himself -- but
          he's too far away to get her attention.

          53b angle - kate and daffy as before 53b
          kate takes daffy out of the drawer, but she's not happy about
          this -- especially when daffy leers at her.

          out of the building.
