           int. mr. wing's store tj.
           mr. wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep
           into the store.

           mister wi daniel clamp would
           like to see you.

           the men quickly set up the big-screen tv set and vcr. one of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the tv screen
          fills with the face of daniel clamp. at a young 40, he's new
          york's most successful real estate developer.

          clamp (on tv)
          good morning, mister wing. let's
          out through to key issues, okay?
          i'm prepared to increase my offer
          substantially.

          (beat)
          now, mister wing, you're attached
          to your business. i appreciate
          that. i'm attached to my own
          business. i develop the biggest
          buildings in new york, and you
          sell, ah, little things. fine.
          but i'm not just talking about
          money here.
          on the big-screen tv, the image widens to incim a an easel
          beside clam , holding an architect's render that shows the
          grandiose of a huge office building,..

           clamp (on tv) (cont.)
           take a look, mister wing --

          (reads)
          "the clamp chinatown center --
          where business gets oriented."
          when i put up a building, it's the
          biggest -- it's the newest -- it's
          the best. people are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          the soft o.s. twittering of gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           gizmo (o.s.)
           tee vee!

           clamp (on tv)
           now,'we've been able to reach an
           understanding with everyone on the
           block -- except for you. let me
           show you what i willing to do
           for you -- a s tand and
           souvenir cone on, right here
           under the at the foot
           traffic thrr here is going to
           make the building look like
           a ghost town.

           mr. wing regards the video image impassively. 


           clamp (on tv) (cont.)
           please if us know when you've 
          made a decision, mister wing. you
          know, i believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           the clamp corporation's logo a stylized "c" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing clamp's image.

          mr. wing
          yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. it is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

          forster
           does that mean you -- 
          he's interrupted as mr. wing coughs -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. when the coughing subsides, he
          answers forster.

      

          mr. wing
          i'm sorry. please tell mister
          clamp that the answer is no.

          forster
          keep the tv.
          as mr. wing walks clamp's men to the door in b.g., hold on the
          tv set -- and a small, furry paw that reaches into frame to
          change the tv channel.
          with the change of stations, the tv screen fills with a scene
          from a rambo picture. sylvester stallone addresses the movie

          camera:

          stallone
          to survive a war... you've got to
          become war.
          then he screws an explosive-filled metal arrowhead onto an
          arrow, and shoots the arrow from a bow. the arrow hits a
          helicopter, which bursts into flames.

          gizmo (0.3.)
          neat!

          but as the helicopter starts to burn, mr. wing comes back and
          angrily turns the tv set off, addressing the unseen gizmo.

          mr. wing
          television again! ai-vuh !. an -
           invention for fools.

           cd
           as he starts coughing again,

    

          5a int. limo/ext. chinatown street (moing) - day 5a

           forster and the bodyguards are dri away from mr. wing's
          store.

          bodyguard
          i'm sorry that didn't work out,
          sir. i thought he'd like the tv.

          forster
          you hear that cough? the guy must
          be eighty -- maybe ninety. we can
          wait.

          a sting of solemn chinese music covers the
          dissolve tot
