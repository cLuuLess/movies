          12 1 ext. cathedral - day 12 1

          mr. and mrs. futterman, dressed for sightseeing, arrive at the
          handsome old cathedral of saint eva marie. in b.g., spot a
          construction crew repairing the sidewalk in front of the
          cathedral.

          sheila
          oh, murray -- what a beautiful
          building!

           mr. futterman
           beautiful? looks like somethin'
           out of the dark ages.
           true, saint eva marie's architecture is on the vy side ...as
           camera notices the ornate windows and the cor 'te topped with
          spooky stone gargoyles -- (ï¿½
           wait a minute. that one there...that's ï¿½' a`rgoyle...

           mr. futterman (c _qï¿½ï¿½ )

          hey''

           sheila
           what is it, murray?
          it's the flying bat-gremlin -- and it leaves its perch to fly

          straight at him --

           mr. futterman
          hey'. help!
           he flails at the gremlin, batting it away from him, but it keeps
          coming back -- as sheila stands back, too terrified to move --

          sheila
          murray, what is it?

          mr. futterman
          it's them!
          (to pedestrians)
          help me! somebody help me!
          but the new yorkers on the sidewalk continue past him, oblivious. pjr.

           futterman grapples with the greml trying to get hold of its slashing claws.
          his face is cut -- and his wrist --. wt he grabs hold of one claw, then the
          other, and manages to fling the struggling gremlin away from him, so that
          it tumbles, off balance, into the constr ion crew's churning cement mixer --
          as sheila rushes to murray's side, the f) tng gremlin emerges from the
          cement mixer's thick whirlpool, coated with ray cement. murray braces for
          another attack -- but the cement weighs th emlin down so much that all
          it can do is flap its wings slowly, lofting pa ully toward the cathedral, as
          the cement starts hardening --
          -- and as the gremlin regains his perch, the cement solidifies, so that he is
          now a gargoyle for real -- and for good.
          mr. futterman catches his breath -and takes off running.

          sheila
          murray -- where are you going?

          mr. futterman
          we have to tell billy! come on!
          sheila follows him.
