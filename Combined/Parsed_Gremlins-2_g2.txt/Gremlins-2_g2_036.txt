          int. billy and kate's apartment (entryway) - night 63

          kate answers the doorbell.

           billy (o.s.)
          its me.
           she undoes the deadbolts and opens the door. billy rushes in.

           billy (cont.)
          hi. i'm sorry i'm late --
          he gives her a fast kiss on the lips -- and, as he lets go of
          her, sees that she's spattered with food.

           billy (cont.)
           what happened to you?
           kate doesn't answer -- she looking at the lipstick mark on
           billy's face.

          it's in the kitchen. billy --
          she follows him to the kitchen.

          billy
          did you feed him?

          kate
          yes --

          billy
          (calls ahead)
          hey, giz, how you --
          they come into the kitchen, which is a mess from daffy's food,
          throwing. the mogwai is hidden behind a little barricade of
          lean cuisine boxes. as kate and billy enter, he throws a lump
          of frozen pineapple that nails billy on the forehead.

           ow! gizmo, what's --
          billy leans over the barricade and looks in -- as daffy tosses a
          glop of cherry cobbler, splattering billy's face.

          billy
          kate ...kate, where did you find
          this guy?

          kate
          in your office -- near that
          drawer, where you said -- billy,
          look out!
          too late -- daffy lobs a single-serving pudding-pack at billy.
          it bursts on impact, staining his shirt.

          billy
          (to daffy) ï¿½
          where's gizmo?
          the mogwai spits, then wings kate with a piece of salisbury
          steak. billy looks at the wall clic: it's 11:15.

          billy
          we've got to get over here.

          kate
          billy -- you said there weren't
          going to be those --

          billy
          there won't be. not if they don't
          eat after midnight.

          kate
          (indicates daffy)
          what about -- him?

          billy
          we'll have to take him with us.
          he snatches a lean cuisine box away and grabs daffy, almost
          getting bitten in the process. kate follows billy as he takes
          the flailing daffy into the living room and stuffs him into his
          leather daypack.

          daffy

          (semi-intelligible)
          wahoo! no! elbow room! don't
          fence me --

           the daypack jumps around wildly as billy zips it shut.

          billy
          you ever want to get out of there,
          you better relax.
          daffy settles down to a low rumble.

          billy (cont.)
          that's better.
          they grab their coats, start toward the door.

          billy (cont.)

          when he came to take gizmo back. i
          asked him how come he could

          guys drivin' cabs in this burg?
          what if somebody gets in one of

          billy realizes what sheila is talking about, as she takes out a
          handkerchief and dabs at the lipstick on his face.

          billy
          oh, uh...that's from -- my boss. i
