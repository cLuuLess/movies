          hey! my vegetable medley!
          before wally can stop him, a gremlin goes over to the potted
          vegetable plants with tubes connecting them to a glass vial.
          he grabs the vial, eats it...and stands still for a moment...
          .as his ears turn into leafy clumps of romaine lettuce.
          wally tries to move on him, but the gremlin menaces his with a
          claw, and goes on to grab a vial from a cauliflower plant...
          chaos ensues, as more gremlins go after more vials and the
          scientists' efforts to stop them result mainly in trashed

          equipment:
          angle on a gremlin trying a vial marked sex hormone. the
          gremlin's face registers big consumer satisfaction -- he downs
          the rest of the vial in one gulp.

          the gremlin swallows the vial...twitches for a moment. he
          painfully croaks out a few words --

          brain gremlin
          i...want...to --
          then, suddenly, the transformation takes hold, in thrashing
          jekyll-and-hyde histrionics that send the gremlin rolling on
          the floor. when he stands, he wears a pair of horn-rimmed
          glasses, and speaks fluently in a new voice, similar to that of

          george plimpton.

          -- talk a little bit about what's
          going on in this room, because i
          think there are some fascinating
          ramifications here for the future.
          when you introduce genetic material
          of research quality to a life form
          such as ours, which is possessed of
          a sort of -- i hesitate'to use the
          word "atavism," but let us say a
          highly aggressive nature...
          the other gremlins, instantly bored with this guy, grab more
          vials and start turning animals loose from their cages, as the
          scientists try in vain to op them.

           .for example, at fellow over
           near the, i believ n ' + a common
          bat of the order -- the
          only mammals, i mig add, capable
          of true flight...
          indeed, a gremlin is approaching cage of the bat who's being
          40 desensitized to light for messenge ing purposes. the gremlin
          grabs a collecting vial connected by surgical tubing to the
          bat's body. the gremlin swallows the vial, then stands
          watching, surprised, as his hands become webbed, like bat wings.
          while this: is happening, the brain gremlin walks over to the bat
          gremlin.

          my friend, you have...potential. i
          want to help you be all that you
          can be...may i?
          as he continues talking, he plucks the intravenous tube from the
          bat's body, and happily jams the needle into the. bat gremlin's
          skin. the bottle with the sunshine logo on it drains quickly...

          the brain gremlin yanks the iv needle from the bat gremlin's

          you have wings, my friend. flap
          them.

          as the twin scientists chase. him.

          .and smashes through it, leaving a jagged bat silhouette in
          the glass behind him. the other gremlins shrink from the
          invading rays of sunlight, but the bat gremlin flies free...
