          a janitor, pushing a cart of cleaning supplies, comes into the
          office area. gizmo, on the floor, peeks around a corner to
          watch as the cart's wheels rumble past him.
          as seen by gizmo, the towering janitor stops at the department's
          water fountain and tries to get a drink. the fountain's spigot
          overshoots, giving the janitor a splash in the face.
          gizmo inches away from the source of the water, and -- seeing a
          puddle on the carpet where the water landed -- carefully avoids
          it. he keeps moving, and evades a second arc of errant water
          from the fountain.
          the janitor decides t )gx,the fountain. attacking the spigot
           with a wrench, he sends off 1morq streams of water. to duck
          0 them, gizmo takes cover, back, isu; under billy's desk...
          .and doesn't see a big splash f'o }wezï¿½ hit billy's chinatown
          picture. while gizmo, thinking the danger is passed, steps out
          from under the desk, the bright colors of billy's painting blur,
          and the blob of water rolls down the illustration board...
          .down the side of the desk...
          gizmo looks up, but too late. from his pov, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. it hits him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â¬.g., camera holds on gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. the
          janitor leaves, and gizmo screams, as -- thwip! thwip! -- two
          tiny furballs shoot out of his body and land in the open drawer
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          thwip! the painful mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          thwip! the fourth and final offspring shoots from gizmo's body,
          and -- as gizmo watches in horror and pain -- bounces crazily
          around the office area, a little superball of fur.
          as gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          mogwai hands reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

          s
          the top edge from inside.

          camera moves in on the cabinet drawer, and the first two new
          mogwais are revealed, standing in the drawer: george and lenny,
          an inseparable pair. lenny is big, dumb, and loyal, while
          george is small, with a criminal caginess -- he gets lenny to do
          everything for him.
          gizmo watches the wastebasket where the third furball landed
          start to rock back and forth -- but is distracted as the
          bouncing furball hits the floor in front of him, then ricochets
          up onto a desktop.
          to sound fx of a bowling ball hitting the pins, the furball
          rolls into a desk corner, and the third mogwai unfolds --
          upside-down. this is daffy, a dizzy, uncontrollably antic
          mogwai with the demented juvenile joie de vivre we associate
          with the great daffy duck.
          in the first seconds following birth, daffy goes daffy over the
          very fact of being alive. he sees his little hands and feet
          unfold,. and gives a whoop

          -- as gizmo watches the ra,k n :,wa t basket tip over. looking
          into the basket, we (and gizmo) se ` umble of office
          wastepaper, which is violently toss e ut...
          .until mohawk, the fourth new mogwai, emerges. this guy is
          pure, malicious evil, a new strain of badness. even as a furry
          mogwai, he's about as cuddly as a cockroach.
          while daffy, up on the desktop, starts playing with everything
          in sight...
          .mohawk, on the floor, moves in on gizmo.

          gizmo
          uh-oh.
          george and lenny drop down to the carpet to join mohawk, as
          gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. there's a grated vent
          opening low on the wall behind him.
          lenny grabs gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and mohawk, moving in
          close, spits in gizmo's eyes.

          through the glass window of billy's cubicle, we hear daffy

          george points to the vent opening behind gizmo, and whispers to

          grate, and george slaps him.

          gizmo is tossed into the vent. . .and the grate is slammed back
