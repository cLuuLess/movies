          grandpa fred and the brain gremlin in the studio, where katsuji
          is working the big floor-model camera.

          grandpa fred
          -- who is able to talk, and he's
          going to talk with us now.
          (to brain gremlin)
          i think the main question people
          have is -- what is it you want?
          the brain gremlin answers in his usual cultured tones, sounding
          lucid.

          brain gremlin
          fred, what we want is, i think,
          what everyone wants, and what you
          and your viewers have --
          civilization,

          the niceties, fred. the fine points.
          diplomacy. compassion. standards,
          manners, tradition. that's what we're
          reaching toward. oh, we may stumble
          along the way, but -- civilization, yes.
          the geneva convention. chamber music.
          susan sontag. everything your society
          has worked so hard to accomplish over
          the centuiries -- that's what we aspire to.
          we want to be civilized. i mean, you take
          a look at this fellow here...
          on tv, a dopey-looking gremlin wanders into frame, grinning stupidly,
          waving at fred's o.s. camera. the brain gremlin reaches out of frame,
          comes back with a gun, and shoots the dopey gremlin. the bar gremlins
          love it.

          brain gremlin (cont.) (on tv)
          now, was that civilized? no. clearly not.
          i fun, but in no sense civilized...
          on tv, fred starts backing nervously away from the armed gremlin.

          grandpa fred (on tv)
          well ...uh, of course that could be argued
          different ways...
          as the bar gremlins live it up 'va e pans to the front doors of the

          ir%
          building. unnoticed by the grem in scene outside the front doors of
          the building has changed. it now apa be red square at night, in
          the 1940s.

          151b ext. building (continuous) 151b

          as the crowd watches, workers with cranes position a cloth theatrical
          backdrop -- the red square scene -- in front of the doors.

          a little to the left...careful, careful...
          a fire chief climbs down from an idled hook-and-ladder and comes over to
          clamp.

          fire chief
          what's this thing for?

          these things can only come out when it's
          dark. we've put all the clocks in the
          building ahead three hours. when they
          think it's sunset...and they see what a
          nice "night" it is outside... they'll all be in
          the lobby, getting ready to come out.
          when they do, we drop this
          backdrop ...and let the sunlight fry 'em.

          it's from a musical i was backing on
          broadway. the one about stalin. it
          closed last week.

          fire chief
          oh, i saw that. boy, that guy could
          d c e.
