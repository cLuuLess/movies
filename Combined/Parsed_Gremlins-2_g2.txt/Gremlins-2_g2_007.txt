          8 int. clamp centre - cable tv editing room 8

          near a sign reading clamp cable network, a news producer and
          reporter are editing videotape that we see on monitors. the
          tape is of the reporter doing his standup in chinatown, on mr.
          wing's boarded-up block.

          .obviously a sad occasion, but
          the bright side is that we can go

          there...
