          billy and forster follow dr. catheter in, to find a riot of
          gremlins, bingeing on genetic elixirs and trashing lab
          equipment.
          forster is quickly waylaid by the gremlin who drank the sex
          hormone earlier, and has become a mutant, amorous girl gremlin,
          with blonde hair and big red lips. she develops an instant
          crush on forster, her heart pounding half-out of her chest.
          the girl gremlin jumps up onto forster's chest, embraces his
          neck, and moves in for a kiss.

          get it off me --
          but dr. catheter is rushing to a cabinet at the back of the
          lab...

          .while billy sees a gremlin eat the lightning-bolt vial that
          was injected into the rat earlier. the gremlin shudders through
          the reaction, but seems not to change...until he spots an
          electric socket and touches his claw to it. the gremlin
          disappears into the socket, as if swallowed by it...

           
          .as forster backs out of the room, the girl gremlin now
          hanging on fiercely to his leg...

           
          .and dr. catheter, in b.g., screams as he takes his arm out of

           
          the cabinet with a gremlin attached by the teeth. trying to
           shake it off, catheter goes tripping through the wrecked lab, 
           crashing into equipment. now a number of other gremlins see the
           scientist on the defensive, and pile onto his, sending him 
          stumbling to the floor... f x)

          .and billy's attention is qught by mohawk, who's zeroing in
          on the cage containing the lve-inch spider that billy saw
          earlier. a surgical tube rtm%s from the hairy spider's body to a
          small glass vial with a spr logo on it. billy moves to stop
           mohawk --- ï¿½ ï¿½ .}}}}}
           -- but now the gremlin w hrftd isappeared into the electric outlet
           emerges from another soc , across the room. he is different
          40 now -- seemingly made of e, crackling electricity. he flies
           close to billy, forcing to back away, so that mohawk can
          grab the vial attached to the spider and escape from the lab.
          finished with billy, the electric gremlin wafts himself onto a
          table full of scientific machinery. he touches his glowing claw
          to a cyclotron. it spins crazily, then shorts out in a shower
          of sparks and smoke...
          .while, on the floor below, the gremlin mob finishes off dr.
          catheter.
