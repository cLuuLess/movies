	int. the suburban - another time, dusk

	grace leans against the window in the back, in one of her 
	darker moods. annie switches radio stations, from bible 
	thumping to farm reports. she shuts it off. silence.

	she sees a road sigh: "little bighorn national monument".

				 annie
		grace, look!

	grace reads the sign.

				  annie
		would you like to see that?

				  grace
		i don't care.

				  annie
			(overlapping)
		i don't care.

	annie's comic mimicking, throws grace off center.

	annie turns off onto the exit. they drive by a massive casino 
	-- it's neon sign flickering. they drive up a hill past a cafe, 
	two indians in high crowned cowboy hats standing outside of 
	the cafe. she drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the 
	monument...

				  annie
		this'll be nice. we haven't seen any 
		of the sights yet. it's history. when 
		i was thirteen i used to love seeing 
		things like this.

				  grace
		you were never thirteen, mom.

	annie laughs, taking it as a joke. grace almost smiles.

	but, annie drives up to sign only to find a closed sign. the 
	park was closed at six. annie stops the car. she's hit a 
	brick wall once more. silence. finally, grace speaks with her 
	usual sarcasm;

				  grace
		great idea. so now what?

	beat. annie's patience snaps;

				  annie
		how long is this going to go on?

				  grace
		what?

				  annie
		you know what i mean?
			(turns to the back seat)
		is this it now? is this the way we're 
		going to be from now on?

	ignoring her, grace edges to the passenger side and exits the 
	car. annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as 
	she speaks:

				  annie
		do you want us to turn around and go 
		back home? do you?

				  grace
		what are you asking me for? you didn't 
		ask me if i wanted to come in the first 
		place -- now i get to decide? forget it!

	she begins to turn away. annie grabs her arm.

				  annie
		who do you think i'm doing this for? 
		i'm doing this for you!

				  grace
		bullshit! it's about you! about you 
		deciding! about you always being 
		right! you always getting everything 
		your way, controlling everybody -- 
		like we work for you or something!

				  annie
		i don't believe this!

				  grace
		you just want to get away from daddy 
		and you're using me to do it!

				  annie
		that's not true! whatever problems your 
		father and i are having, have nothing 
		to do with this.

				  grace
		you're amazing! you act like i don't 
		live in that house! don't you think i 
		hear the two of you!? don't you think 
		i can tell what's going on? i'm not 
		five years old, mom!
			(annie is stopped)
		you want to divorce daddy and daddy 
		doesn't want to.

				  annie
		did he tell you that?

				  grace
		he doesn't have to! it's, like, so 
		obvious you can't stand him.

				  annie
		that's not true!

				  grace
		then why do you want to leave?

				  annie
		it's... it's not that simple to explain. 
		i know you think it is, but it's not. 
		the truth is, i don't really know what 
		i want to do. i don't have all the 
		answers.

				  grace
		no, you just act like you do.

	annie is choked with fury. she doesn't know whether to 
	scream, cry or strangle grace. she turns away and begins 
	walking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees. she comes 
	to a cemetery enclosed by a black railing. at the crest of 
	the hill there's a stone monument "the little bighorn 
	cemetery."

	in the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides 
	below her, white tombstones. a place of sorrow. a cool breeze 
	ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets. 
	frustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what 
	action to take -- annie, for the first time in frozen, 
	standing still -- and with her, comes a rush of emotion.

	she sits with her back against the monument and begins to 
	weep. for grace, for robert, herself, for the tombstones, for 
	everyone.

	a flashlight shines on her face. it is a park ranger.

				  park ranger
		you okay, ma'am?

				  annie
			(wipes face)
		yes. fine.

				  park ranger
		that young lady is getting a little 
		worried.

	annie realizes she left grace alone as it got darker.

				  annie
		i'm sorry. i'm sorry...

	annie rises and is escorted back to the suburban by the 
	ranger. she sees:

	grace is sitting in the front seat now, waiting for her -- 
	like a little girl lost.
