	int. maclean farmhouse kitchen - morning

	grace is putting on her boots on a bench beside a back door. 
	she is wearing her mother's outfit. as she slides the boot 
	on, we see behind her a row of framed photos -- robert, grace 
	and annie in happy times.

	she slaps a note on the refrigerator, with a magnet -- "gone 
	riding. back around 10. love, g."
