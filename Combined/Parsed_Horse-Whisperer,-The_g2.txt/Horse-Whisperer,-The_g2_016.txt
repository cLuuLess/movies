	ext. connecticut countryside - morning

	long shot of the girls riding at an easy pacing, talking all 
	the time. grace is an elegant rider, quite self-assured for a 
	13-year-old... we come into the scene at the moment the 
	girls have just shared a secret or a fantasy. judith is 
	giggling uncontrollably. grace laughs as she says:

				  grace
		...oh, come on! you think the same thing!

				  judith
		i just could never say it!

	they stop at the end of the field, facing the woods.

				  grace
		do you want to go around by the 
		old road?

				  judith
		why don't we just cut through the 
		woods?

	grace nods. they ride into the woods, continuing their talk.
