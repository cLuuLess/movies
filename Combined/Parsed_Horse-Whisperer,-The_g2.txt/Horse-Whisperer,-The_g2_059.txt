	int. central park west apartment - night

	annie sits alone at the kitchen table, nursing a glass of 
	wine.

	robert enters and sits opposite her, wearing a tuxedo -- his 
	tie and collar undone.

				  annie
		how was the dinner?

				  robert
			   (wry)
		all our "favorite" people were there 
		saying all their "favorite" things about 
		their "favorite" subjects. i thought to 
		myself, we've been friends with these 
		people almost twenty years and nobody 
		knows anybody. we're so afraid we won't 
		like each other and have nobody go to 
		dinners with.

				  annie
		why did you go?

				  robert
			(surprised)
		they're still our friends, annie. it's 
		nothing serious. you kid about them all 
		the time... and i could tell paul really 
		appreciated me being there.

	he drinks annie's wine as she looks at him.

				  robert
		did you get a hold of that horse guy?

				  annie
		yeah.

				  robert
		what did he say?

				  annie
		no.

	robert nods. accepting. silence. annie sips her wine. then:

				  robert
		i was thinking... maybe we should think 
		about the three of us going someplace 
		warm... remember that house we rented in 
		bermuda... the pink one with the --

	his arm accidentally spills the wine.

				  robert
		shit.

	as he bends down to wipe it up with a napkin, annie watches 
	robert clean the spill. something about his movements, his 
	posture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having 
	the inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing 
	over the rough sports -- strikes her hard. annie realizes the 
	love she feels for robert isn't fading. it's gone.

	he finishes cleaning and sits.

				  robert
		what was i saying?

				  annie
		about us going someplace warm... 
		someplace grace'll have to wear shorts 
		or bathing suits or summer dresses...

	robert looks at her and realizes it's a bad idea. he nods, 
	again, getting the message. silence. in that silence, annie 
	looks at him... and makes a decision:

				  annie
		robert, i want to take pilgrim out to mr. 
		booker. drive him out to montana... with 
		grace.

	robert is confused... and a little worried.

				  robert
		i don't understand. you just said he 
		said no.

				  annie
		he did, but... i think i can change his 
		mind.

				  robert
		that's the craziest thing i ever heard. 
		absolutely not.

				  annie
		robert, grace isn't adjusting to school. 
		and she can't sit in this apartment all 
		day... i think it would be good for her.

			  	  robert
			(at a loss)
		no! what are you -- you're serious about 
		this?

				  annie
		i've called liz. they can set me up with 
		a trailer for pilgrim. i thought we'd 
		stay at motels along the way...

				  robert
			(overlapping)
		you've already made arrangements!?

				  annie
		no. i was just researching. calm down.

				  robert
		i come home and you tell me we're going 
		to drive a psychotic horse to montana! i 
		can't just pick up and leave...

				  annie
		i'm not asking you to. i'll do it.

				  robert
		you want to do this by yourself? how? 
		you can't take care of pilgrim all the --

			 	  annie
		he'll be sedated. i know horses, robert. 
		i'm the one who taught grace how to ride.

				  robert
			(overlapping)
		what... bo-... what about the magazine?

				  annie
		i'm in charge. i went back very soon 
		after the accident. they didn't expect me 
		for a couple of months. i'll just take 
		that time now... i can still oversee 
		things from montana... take my fax... 
		my computer...

	beat. robert fears this is about the marriage. yet --

				  robert
		no. it's, uh... no, i really don't think 
		it's a good idea

				  annie
		why?!

				  robert
			(searching)
		her psychiatrist... said... she needs 
		security now... stability...

				  annie
		i can't say he's been all that effective 
		with her.

				  robert
		are you a psychiatrist? he said it takes 
		time.

				  annie
		i don't care what he says! we have to do 
		something, robert! i can't sit here and 
		trust everything's going to work out just 
		by pretending it will.

				  robert
		i'm not pretending anything!

	beat. robert just stares at her. he looks concerned... almost 
	worried. annie gets uncomfortable.

				  annie
		what?

	it is very difficult for robert to say;

				  robert
		i thought... well, ever since the 
		accident, i just thought we...

	he stops. annie knows where he headed and prays to god he 
	doesn't continue. he doesn't. a thick silence hangs between 
	them.

				  robert
		i really wish i could understand why 
		you think this is so necessary.

				  annie
			(frustrated)
		robert, we're losing her. we're losing 
		her.
			(he listens)
		i don't care what the doctors say. the 
		truth is, they don't know anymore than 
		we do -- less, when it comes to grace... 
		this may not sound sensible or... logical, 
		but nobody's suggesting anything better. 
		i can't explain it, robert. i just have 
		this feeling... this annoying... bloody 
		feeling that if... if, somehow, pilgrim 
		can be made all right... then so can grace. 
		i just know it!

	robert can feel the strength of her will. he can find no way 
	around it.

				  robert
		what if she doesn't want to go?

				  annie
		she will if you think she should.

				  robert
		and you think it's best if i don't come.

				  annie
			(hesitates)
		no, that's not what i said. i'm not a 
		dictator. if you feel you should come, 
		then come. just do whatever you think 
		is right.

	at some moment, they realize grace is standing at the entrance 
	to the kitchen. they are surprised.

				  grace
		i'm not going! i don't care what she 
		says!

	annie lowers her head. robert stares at grace as she walks to 
	him.

				  grace
		daddy?... i don't want to go.

	grace stands next to robert. he holds her hands. annie looks 
	at him, without sympathy. robert looks back. in his face is 
	the total acceptance of what must be. as well as the sadness 
	of it's inevitability. he looks back at his daughter, whose 
	eyes have never left him.
