	int. stables, the dyer horse farm - morning

	there are several horses in their stalls. grace and judith 
	enter, talking, carrying their english saddles. judith stops 
	at a stall, disappearing into it as she says "hello?"..., 
	grace continues to the end stall.

	pilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her.

				  grace
		hello, beautiful boy.

	he's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition. 
	she enters, touching his muzzle. he plays with her by nudging 
	her back.

				  grace
		stop... will you stop!
