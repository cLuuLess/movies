	int. truck stop diner - day

	annie and grace enter. they look around:

	formica floors, truckers in caps and beer bellies stuffed 
	into booths or at the counter. there is not a single space 
	available.

	annie and grace stand near the entrance. another trucker 
	enters and they step aside, huddled together in this foreign 
	land.
