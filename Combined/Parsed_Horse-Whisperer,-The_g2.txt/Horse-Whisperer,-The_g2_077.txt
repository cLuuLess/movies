	int. suburban - morning

	annie and grace, both in front seats, eating doughnuts and 
	coffee. they stop.

	pov -- through the windshield is an endless sky and a rolling 
	sea of land.

				  grace
		gee, this looks like a fun place.

				  annie
		don't they believe in signs here?

				  grace
		what would they say? "ten miles to big 
		rock." "twenty miles to bigger rock."

				  annie
		there was supposed to be a turn off. 
		did i miss it?

				  grace
		i didn't see it.

	their suburban is the only vehicle on what seems like miles 
	of road. annie sighs and puts the suburban in drive.
