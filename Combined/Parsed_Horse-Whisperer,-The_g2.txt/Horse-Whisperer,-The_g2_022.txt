	int. train - late morning

	annie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her, 
	her cellular phone, ever-ready. the train passes through 
	beautiful countryside but annie is focused on an editorial 
	she's writing.

	the train pulls into a station and stops, causing annie to 
	take a break and stretch her arms and neck. she looks out the 
	window for the first time and sees:

	a man, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. she 
	watches as the man holds out his arms to his two young 
	children, who are getting off the train. he picks them up as 
	his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm 
	around his waist. the children talk a mile a minute and the 
	father listens to every word.

	annie doesn't even realize she is staring. as they leave the 
	platform, she turns back to her laptop. as the train begins 
	to move again, annie returns to work.

	her cellular phone rings. she answers.

				  annie
		yeah?... hi. i made the 1:00 so...

	the expression on her face sinks into a stunned panic.
