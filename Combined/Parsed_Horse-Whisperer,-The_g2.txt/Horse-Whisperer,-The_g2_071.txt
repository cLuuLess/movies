	she crosses the motel parking lot to the horse trailer. she 
	looks in through the siding at pilgrim, checking on him. she 
	sees he is caught his halter on the side of the van. she 
	crosses to the trailer door, hesitates, then opens it. 
	pilgrim looks at her. gathering her courage, she climbs 
	inside. he is still, looking at her. she carefully frees his 
	halter. and suddenly he bares his teeth, biting at her. she 
	stumbles back out of the trailer, slamming the door shut. she 
	stands leaning against the trailer -- wondering if she's out 
	of her mind for attempting this.
