	int. annie and robert's bathroom/bedroom - night

	annie and robert stand before their separate sinks, talking 
	to each other through their separate mirrors, as they wash up 
	for bed.

				  annie
		you've got to stop doing that?

				  robert
		doing what?

				  annie
		helping all the time! running to her 
		every time she trips or falls... 
		anticipating her all the time.

	robert shuts off his sink and dries his face, without a word. 
	he exits into the bedroom, and gets into bed. for a beat, he 
	stares up at the ceiling -- then says quite plainly.

				  robert
		you know, annie, this didn't just happen 
		to you.

	annie is applying moisturizer when she hears this. as it 
	sinks in, she doesn't like it.
