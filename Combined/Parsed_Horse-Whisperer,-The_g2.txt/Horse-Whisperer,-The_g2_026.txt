	ext. woods - day

	liz hammond on a cellular, walking away from the crowd.

				  liz
		annie, it's liz. how's grace?

				  annie
			(journalistic)
		her leg was shattered so they had to, 
		uh... remove it. she had some bleeding 
		but it's under control.

				  liz
		oh god, annie, i'm so sorry. i... i 
		know you're being hit with a low now, 
		i don't want to take too much of your 
		time but i have to talk to you about 
		pilgrim.

	annie hears the name as if it's some distant echo she can't 
	quite identify; liz speaks quickly as annie watches grace 
	breathing in her sleep --

				  liz
		it's not good. i've never seen an animal 
		with these injuries still breathing. i 
		know this is difficult to hear right now 
		i'd like your permission to put him down. 
		it's the really best thing we can do for --

	that was too much information for annie;

				  annie
		wait, uh, i, i don't understand. start 
		again -- he's alive...

				  liz
		yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...

				  annie
		well, of course, right...

				  robert
		what is it?

				  liz
			(overlapping)
		we really shouldn't wait...

				  annie
			(overlapping)
		hold on, liz...
			(to robert)
		something about pilgrim...

	the doctor pokes his head in.

				  doctor
			(overlapping)
		mr. and mrs. maclean...

				  annie
			(overlapping)
		-- put him down. she says...

				  robert
			(overlapping, to doctor)
		yes. hi.
			(to annie)
		tell her you'll call her back.

	he exits with the doctor.

				  annie
		liz, listen, the doctor's here and i 
		just can't, uh... talk now... so --

				  liz
			(interrupting)
		i understand, but annie, please...

				  annie
			(overlapping)
		- see, what you can do for him --...

				  liz
			(overlapping)
		annie, no matter what i do, this horse 
		will never be the same.

				  annie
		... i just don't know right now! do 
		whatever you can and when grace is --

				  liz
		it isn't right to make him suffer...

				  annie
		and i can say the same thing about my 
		daughter! but she is suffering! can you 
		solve that problem!
			(liz is quiet)
		i can't deal with this now, liz! if you 
		need a yes or no right now, then no -- 
		don't do it! not until i know grace is 
		all right. now, please! just do what you 
		can. okay?
		  	(softer)
		please.

	liz is stopped by annie's almost pleading tone.

				  liz
		all right...

	they hang up. annie takes a breath. robert re-enters.

				  annie
		what did he say?

				  robert
		nothing new. he's just going off duty.

	beat. silence.

				  annie
		i'm going to get all the nurses' 
		names... it's good to know all their 
		names.

	robert nods. but neither of them moves. they stand motionless 
	for a beat, then annie begins to break down and eases herself 
	into robert's arms.

	robert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly 
	comfort. his expression tells us it's the moment he's been 
	expecting... and wanting. now she'll be all right, in his arms. 
	whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt 
	insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment 
	-- for robert -- gone.

	but annie's expression tells us something different. her 
	instinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the 
	same anymore. something doesn't feel right. something isn't 
	working anymore about his comforting embrace.

				  annie
		i should go get some of her things.

				  robert
		no, let me go.

				  annie
			(gently pushing away)
		no, i'll go. you stay... in case she 
		wakes up.
