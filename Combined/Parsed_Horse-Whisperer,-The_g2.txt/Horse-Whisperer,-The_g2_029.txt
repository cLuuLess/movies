	int. grace's room - a day remembered

	annie is playing with toddler grace. chasing her around the 
	room. picking her and tossing her onto a small, toddler bed. 
	blowing into her stomach. grace is laughing uncontrollably.

	end of memory

	annie slides the pilgrim picture back into the frame, then 
	returns to her task of packing.
