      the bell on the bakery door rings. billy three rivers
      walks in looking very official. jimmy opens the door.

                             jimmy
                hi, billy.

      he comes in and velma walks in from the kitchen closing
      the door behind her.

                             three rivers
                velma, seen any smugglers tonight?

      velma says nothing.

                             jimmy

                smugglers before.

                rosalie is worried people are gonna think
                the mohawks let in terrorists. plus, i
                got the troopers on my back. they want
                the illegals and they say there's some
                white lady with them too. is that true,
                jimmy?
