     ray and lila drive across the smooth surface of the
     river. ray smokes with one hand and holds the gun with
     the other.


                             lila
               how many bedrooms?

                            ray

                            lila
               how old?

                            ray
               five and fifteen.

                            lila
               i got a boy. almost one.

     ray looks at her.

                            lila (cont'd)
               he lives with my mother-in-law. (after a
               moment) she stole him from me.

                            ray
               stole him?

                            lila
               yeah. right out of the hospital.

                             ray
               stole him?

                                                           37.


                            lila
               tribal police don't get involved in stuff
               like that.


     lila looks out across the river at dusk with no
     expression. the ice looks clean and still.

     ray picks up speed to climb the river bank.
