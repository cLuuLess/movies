     the tv is on and ricky is untangling a ball of red
     christmas lights.

                            t.j.
                      (dials the phone)
               -hi, is mitch there? (a long pause)

     the microwave dings. holding the phone, t.j. takes out
     two hungry man dinners and sets them on the table.

                            t.j. (cont'd)
               -hi mitch. it's t.j. no, t.j. from
               school. yeah, man. right. uh, i was
               wondering if you still needed those
               numbers we were talking about `cause i
               got one.
               -how much?
               -cool, but the thing is i don't really
               have any wheels at the moment.

               -yeah, but there's one more thing...(he
               whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no

               -yeah, exactly. yeah, man. thanks a lot.
               bye.

                                                              61.


                            t.j. (cont'd)
                      (to ricky)
               ricky, time to eat.

     t.j. turns around. ricky has wrapped himself in christmas
     lights from head to toe, by slowly revolving while
     holding the strings.

                            ricky
               hey t.j., watch this!

     he plugs in the lights and they turn on.

                            t.j.
               yeah, that's pretty cool. but it's gonna
               hurt when you sit down.

     ricky giggles.

                            t.j. (cont'd)
               now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time.
