     bernie hands her a paper cup of coffee.

                            bernie
               rita said you quit.

                            lila
               she fired me.

                            bernie
               that's not what she said.

                            lila
               well, she should have. i can't see to
               count the money. i told you that. i come
               up short half the time.

                            bernie
               then get some glasses.

                            lila
               they make me carsick.

                            bernie
               gimme a break.

     she sips the coffee.

                            lila
               so where are we going?

                            bernie
               the tribal council needs someone to
               answer phones.

                              lila
               no way!

     she reaches for the door handle.

                            bernie
               why not? you can answer a phone, can't
               you?

                                                             52.


                            lila
               not there! not with them.

     she starts to get out. he notices the horizon, buried
     under the snow, near the camper.

                            bernie
                      (suspicious)
               what's that?

                              lila
               i bought it.

                              bernie
               from who?

                            lila
               some white lady.

     he says nothing. taps his thumbs on the steering wheel,
     suspicious. a long moment passes.

                              lila (cont'd)
               what?

                            bernie
               what do you need a car for?

                            lila
               to get to work. so i don't have to walk
               in the breakdown lane. last week i almost
               got hit by the plow.

                            bernie
               you'll live. and you know what i'm
               talking about.

                            lila
               it doesn't have a trunk.

     he stares at straight ahead.

                            lila (cont'd)
               all right, all right! i'll go.
