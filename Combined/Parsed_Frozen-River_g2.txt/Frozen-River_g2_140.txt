139   int. village bakery, kitchen - night                      139

      lila and ray listen from the kitchen. ray eyes the back
      door.

      ray grabs her jacket off the oven and takes half the cash
      out of the pocket and hands it to lila.

                              ray
                i gotta go.

      lila takes the money. the chinese girls look on confused.
      one gets up and grabs her jacket, but ray motions her
      back.

                             ray (cont'd)
                no. you stay here.

      ray hurries to the back door, opens it, but bernie
      littlewolf is there. at the sight of him, ray backs up.

      he walks in.

                              bernie
                hi, lila.

                              lila
                hi bernie.

                             bernie
                you're in a lot of trouble.

      lila looks at him, unfazed.

                             bernie (cont'd)
                the council voted to expel you.

                              lila
                expel me?

                             bernie
                for five years. you can appeal, but
                you'll never be able to change rosalie's
                mind.

                                                      99.


                       lila
          they can't do that.

                       bernie
          they'll make your life miserable if you
          try to stay.

                       lila
          they've already done that.

                       bernie
          believe me, it could get even worse.

                       ray
          i thought this was all legal on the
          reservation.

bernie ignores her.

                       ray (cont'd)
                 (to lila)
          look, i gotta get home.

she moves for the door, but bernie blocks her.

                       bernie
          if she leaves, they'll turn you in lila.
          the troopers want somebody.

                       ray
          but, she's a mohawk.

                       bernie
          the chiefs want her out, so there's
          nothing standing between her and the
          troopers.

                       ray
          listen, my kids got no one but me.

                       bernie
          if you leave she won't see her son again.

ray and bernie stare at each other.

                        lila
          let her go.

                       bernie
          lila, you're giving up on him and he's
          only one year old.

                                                             100.


                             lila
                       (to ray)
                just go.

      ray goes to the door, but turns around...

                             ray
                at least you got family to take care of
                him, ya' know?
