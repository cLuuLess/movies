78   ext. acclaim at bob's motel -   night                       78

     the pakistani man and woman hurry out of the trunk,
     looking around, and rush to the passenger door of the
     acclaim, speaking frantically to each other.

     the dealer tries to hustle them to the garage, but they
     won't be moved.

     ray starts to back out, but the dealer knocks on their
     window. ray rolls it down.

                            dealer
                      (heavy accent)
               they say there's a bag.

                            ray
               it was too heavy. we had to unload it.

                                                            62.


     the dealer tells the woman in urdu. she becomes
     hysterical. she grabs ray through the window and the
     dealer pulls her off.

                            ray (cont'd)
               what's the matter with her!?

                            dealer
               she had something in the bag.

     the woman continues screaming in urdu.

                            ray
               what is she saying!?

     he speaks to her in urdu.

                            dealer
               she says her baby. her baby was in the
               bag.

     the dealer and the man hurry the wailing pakistani woman
     into the garage.
