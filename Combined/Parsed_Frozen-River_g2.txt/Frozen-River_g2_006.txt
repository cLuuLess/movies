5   ext. ray's trailer - day                                       5

    a pick-up truck draped with a "wide load" banner leads
    two semis hauling halves of a double wide mobile home
    wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind.

    ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly,
    trying not to pee himself.

    t.j. comes out of the shed.

    the doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard.

    guy versailles, pot-bellied, in a green velour running
    suit, squeezes out of his truck. on the door: "massena
    modular and mobile homes, new and reconditioned."

    ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and
    tries to climb the side of it. the truck driver looks
    down from his cab.

                           t.j.
                     (to ricky)
              get down.

    ray peeks out the kitchen curtain.

                                                       6.


after a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a
pasted-on smile.

                       ray
          we're all ready for ya'.

she points to the new concrete foundation. he consults a
clipboard.

                       versailles
          we'll need the balloon payment to unload.

t.j. looks at ray.

                       ray
          we have it, it's just that they called
          troy from titus last night. that's where
          troy works. the ski place? and anyway-

                       versailles
          have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?

                       ray
          it was some emergency with the lifts. so
          he took off without thinking with the
          money. completely forgot you were coming.
          so as soon as he gets back-

                       versailles
          when's he gonna be back?

                       ray
          as soon as he can get here, i'll just run
          it down to you.

t.j. could crawl out of his skin.

                       versailles
                 (ironic smile)
          this is the second time you've dragged me
          out here. if you don't come up with it by
          christmas, you've lost your fifteen
          hundred dollar deposit.

he walks toward his car. she follows him.


                       ray
          look, mr. versales, i have a good job at
          all for a dollar. they're probably gonna
          make me a manager after christmas so i
          can handle the payments if you just leave
          the house-

                                                         7.


he gets in the car.

                       versailles
          call me when you have the balloon
          payment.

he makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's
rev their engines and grind into reverse.

                       ray
          i'll call you...

her voice is drowned out by revving engines.

ricky rushes to her.

                       ricky
          wait, where are they going?

she takes his face in her hands.

                       ray
          listen to me. we'll get them back.

                       ricky
          but why are they leaving?

                       ray
          ricky, i'll get them back. i promise,
          honey.

                       ricky
          that's our house!

he breaks away from her and runs down the road chasing
after the semis. ray chases after ricky until he runs out
of steam and stops, panting.

she catches up to him and tries to hug him. he pushes her
away. she gets down on her knees and takes his face in
her hands.

                       ray
          we're gonna get it back.

she picks him up and walks back to the trailer. ricky
looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down
the road.

                       ray (cont'd)
                 (to t.j.)
          you better hurry or you're going to miss
          the bus. let's get your clothes on,
          ricky.

                                                           8.


    t.j. just stares at her.

                           t.j.
              i can get a job you know.

                           ray
              you're 15, t.j.

                           t.j.
              they won't ask any questions.

                           ray
              you're finishing school.

                           t.j.
              come on, you don't think we can live on
              what you make at all for a dollar do you?

                           ray
              you're going to school.

    she goes inside.   t.j. follows.

                           t.j.
              i bet i could make more than you do.

    she ignores him.
