13   ext. mohawk bingo palace, parking lot - day                13

     ray walks out of the front entrance back across the
     parking lot toward the horizon through rows of cars...

     across the parking lot, lila littlewolf, 20, a mohawk
     girl with long black hair bursts out of the "employees
     entrance" and hurries across the parking lot pulling off
     her scratch card apron as she walks.

     ray catches sight of her, but before ray reaches the
     horizon, lila reaches the acclaim, gets in it and backs
     out.

                            ray
               hey!

                                                              15.


     but lila drives off.

     ray jumps back in the horizon and takes off after her.
