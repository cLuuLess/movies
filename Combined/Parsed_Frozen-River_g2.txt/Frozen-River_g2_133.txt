132   ext. river bank - night                                    132

      two headlights are seen in the distance coming toward
      them. a pickup truck approaches along the shore.

      jimmy drives it. he gets out, gathers ray, lila and the
      two chinese girls into the back of the truck and drives
      away.

      ray looks back as the acclaim slips through the ice and
      disappears.

      trooper napoli reaches the scene, too late. no one is
      there.
