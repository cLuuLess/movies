85   int. acclaim on frozen river - night                        85

     ray and lila creep along.

                            lila
               look, there. tracks.

                              ray
                        (squints)
               where?

                              lila
               up there.

     ray speeds up. faint tire tracks appear in the distance.

                            lila (cont'd)
               slow down, i don't want to run over it.
               stop. i think it was here.

     ray stops the car. lila gets out. ray puts her jacket
     over her head and follows.

     ray's cell phone plays "old macdonald" on the seat of the
     acclaim.
