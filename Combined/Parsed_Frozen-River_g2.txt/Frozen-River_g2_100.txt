      lila and ray drive away.

                               lila
                he was dead.

                             ray
                he was just cold.

                               lila
                he was dead.

                             ray
                okay, whatever, you brought him back to
                life.

                             lila
                that was the great spirit, not me.

                             ray
                all i know is kmart is closed and i got
                nothing for under the tree.

      lila looks at ray.

                               ray (cont'd)
                what?

      lila says nothing.


                             ray (cont'd)
                look, i don't have time for that. i can't
                get deep about every little thing. i just
                have to keep on going. i only need one
                more run to have enough for my double.
