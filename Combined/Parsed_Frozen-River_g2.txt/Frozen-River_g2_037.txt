                       mike

                       mike

                       lila
          does bernie littlewolf run your whole
          life?

                       mike
          no, but he said not to sell you a car.

                       lila
          i gotta walk down 37 with the semis
          kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just
          to get to the work.

                       mike
          for you, all i got are two chevettes,a
          horizon and a civic.

                       lila
          i don't like chevettes.

                       mike

she holds out a wad of cash.

                       lila

               that thing has been sittin' here for six
               months.

               i don't want bernie in my face. okay?

                            lila
