145   int. house on point - night                                145

      evelyn tires to push her out, but lila walks in the
      house.

                             evelyn
                what do you want?

      lila walks up to the little jake sitting in his high
      chair, his face covered in carrots.

      she reaches out to touch him, but evelyn pushes her hand
      away.

                             lila
                i need his coat.

      lila picks up the baby, and looks around.


                             lila (cont'd)
                where's his coat?

                             evelyn
                you can't have him.

                                                             103.


      she grabs lila's arm, but lila shakes her arm free and
      wraps little jake in her own jacket.

                             lila
                say goodbye to your dudah.

      evelyn stands in front of the door, blocking lila. lila
      stops and they stand for a moment looking at each other.
      there is anger and sadness. evelyn moves aside.

      lila walks out with the baby.
