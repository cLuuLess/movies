39   ext. lila's camper - day                                    39

     ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops.

     the horizon is still there and all is quiet.

     ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the
     bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking
     over her shoulder every once in while at the camper.

     once she has tied the cars together she gets back into
     the acclaim, but instead of driving off, she just sits
     there.

     after a moment, she gets out with the gun and walks up to
     the camper.

     the bullet hole in the door has a sock stuffed in it.
