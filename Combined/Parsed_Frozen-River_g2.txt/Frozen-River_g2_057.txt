56   ext. house on point - night                                 56

     near the river, smoke curls from the chimney of a modest
     house.

     lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of pringles
     potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below
     where a huge white dog, part wolf, takes his share.

                                                              46.


     from the tree lila looks inside the window of the house
     where:

     a baby boy, "little jake," about a year old, bangs his
     spoon on his high chair tray then throws it down.

     evelyn littlewolf, 48, a tall thin mohawk woman with long
     hair pulled back, picks it up and gives it back to him.

     he throws it again. she knows the game. she gives it
     back, but the third time she holds it just out of his
     reach and laughs at him. he bangs his fists on the tray.

     lila drinks in the sight.

     abruptly, the door opens and evelyn leans out.

                            evelyn
               chance! chance, get in here before you
               freeze your ass off.

     the white dog looks up at lila who shakes the pringles
     can upside down to show it's empty.

     chance goes inside. the door shuts behind him.

     lila stuffs a wad of cash in the can and jumps down from
     the tree. she leaves it near the front door and hurries
     into the woods.

                                                        cut to:
