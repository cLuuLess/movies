7   int. all for a dollar store - day                              7

    ray stacks shelves with a knock-off version of plastic
    "my little pony" in a messy aisle of boxes.

    matt, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by.

                            ray
                     (soft)
              matt. could i talk to you?

    he looks at her.

                           ray (cont'd)
              i need to come on full-time.

    matt blinks with a blank expression then:

                           matt
              i see you as a short timer.

                           ray
              what is that?

                           matt
              a short timer. not here for long, not
              really committed.

    ray follows him to the stock room.

                                                             11.


                           ray
              when i started you said it would be six
              months before i could come on full-time.
              and that was two years ago.

    he opens a can of red bull and takes a sip.

                           matt
              it's my opinion.

                           ray
              well, i mean, you know, i do show up.
              pat's late everyday. she's late now.
              she's always late.


    he stares blankly at her. she can think of nothing else
    to say. he walks out.

    ray resumes unpacking ponies.

    a moment later pat, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. as pat
    hangs up her coat, ray glimpses a tatoo just above her
    low riding pants with the words "how you doin'?".

    ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and
    heads out the back door.

                           ray (cont'd)
              see ya' tomorrow.
