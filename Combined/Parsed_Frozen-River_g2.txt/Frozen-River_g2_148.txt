      ray sits in the backseat. the two chinese girls beside
      her.

                             ray
                how long is it for me. you know if i
                confess?

                             trooper napoli
                as long as they're not on a watch list.
                four months.

      he glances around at them.

                             trooper napoli (cont'd)
                i don't think you have much to worry
                about judging from the look of them,
                probably brought here to work in the sex
                trade.

      ray looks at the two girls.

                             ray
                will they get sent back?

                             trooper napoli
                not necessarily. they can apply for
                asylum.

      he lights one for her. she takes it, shaking.

                             trooper napoli
                is there somebody i can call for you? to
                take care of your children.

                              trooper napoli
                a relative.

                              ray
                a friend.

      trooper napoli looks at her.
