129   int. acclaim on frozen river - night                       129

      ray and lila hold their breath as they cross the river.
      they make it over the midpoint and ray accelerates toward
      the shore.

      two hundred feet from the bank, the back right tire hits
      a crack in the ice. the tire drops and the under belly of
      the car scrapes the ice. sparks fly.

      the right rear end of the car drops down and the front
      left tire lifts off the ice. the car teeters back and
      forth.

      ray and lila sit perfectly still.

                             lila
                we gotta crawl out the window.

      lila rolls down her window. the car shifts. the wad of
      cash slides toward the edge of the dashboard. ray grabs
      it.

      lila pops the trunk. the two chinese girls scramble out.
      the four begin running for the shore.

      angle from the under the bridge:

      trooper napoli watches the action on the ice.

                                                               93.
