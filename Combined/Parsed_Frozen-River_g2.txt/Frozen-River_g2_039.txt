               what about them?

     she finds change and hands it to him.

                            ray (cont'd)
               here, lunch money.

                            ray

               get the horizon and kick some serious
               butt.

     t.j. goes out the door behind ricky and slams it in ray's
     face.

     ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror
     to put on her mascara. she cakes it on trying to ignore
     the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it. finally she
     stops and stares at herself.

                                                          cut to:
