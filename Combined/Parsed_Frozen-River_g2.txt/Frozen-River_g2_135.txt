134   int. village bakery, kitchen - night                      134

      an industrial oven sits beside an old couch. lila, ray
      and the teenage girls stand near it shivering.

      velma looks them over, frowning and shakes her head.


                              velma
                i don't see how i can get any baking
                done. i'm supposed to be baking 200
                doughnuts for pee wee lacrosse and now i
                have people bleeding and dripping all
                over my kitchen.

      she opens a closet filled with indian medicine plants and
      takes out several kinds.

                              velma (cont'd)
                       (to ray)
                sit down, i can't reach up that high.

      ray sits down. velma reaches up and dabs ray's grazed and
      bleeding forehead.

                             velma (cont'd)
                       (to ray)
                looks like somebody tried to blow your
                brains out.

      ray winces in pain.

                             velma (cont'd)
                get outta here, jimmy. they gotta strip
                down. (to girls) gimme those jackets.

      velma motions to the chinese girls to take off their
      coats. they stare at her shivering.

      she gently goes to one of the girls and helps her out of
      her jean jacket. under it she wears a short sleeved shirt
      showing her bruised arms.

      velma sees the bruises.

                             velma (cont'd)
                somebody's been beatin' up on you.

      lila and ray see the girl's black and blue arms.

                                                             95.


      velma hangs the girl's jacket on the big oven to dry and
      gives her an old blanket to keep warm.

      then velma turns to lila.

                               velma (cont'd)
                you, too.
