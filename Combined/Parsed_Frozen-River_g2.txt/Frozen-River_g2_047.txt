     ricky watches cartoons on the big screen tv. t.j. flips
     through the telephone book to the back section: akwesasne
     and scans columns of names mostly either "bonaparte"
     "littlewolf" or "threerivers". he chooses a name and
     dials the number.

                            t.j.
               -hello (in a grown-up voice) is this mrs.
               irene threerivers?
               -mrs. bonaparte, i have good news.

                             t.j. (cont'd)
                -i'm the business manager of mr. e.f.
                threerivers and i have been authorized to
                inform you that you have inherited money.

                -wait, i don't want any money, i want to
                give you money.
                -that's right. you have inherited money
                from his computer fortune.
                -he was the second richest man next to
                bill gates.
                -he left you twenty-six thousand seven
                hundred and fifty dollars.(pause)
                -twenty-six thousand seven hundred and
                fifty dollars!
                -oh no, you have no obligation
                whatsoever, mrs. threerivers, just a
                small processing fee of 29.00 dollars
                will authorize me to send out your first
                payment of thirteen-thousand three
                hundred and seventy five dollars.
                -you can put it on any major credit card.
                (pause) of course, you can always refuse
                the money.
                -sure, i can hold.

     t.j. holds his pen poised to write and looks at ricky
     watching tv, then at the clock. it reads 3:40 pm.
