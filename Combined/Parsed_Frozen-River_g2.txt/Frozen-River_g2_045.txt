44   ext. cornwall island woods, old casino -    night           44

     ray and lila bounce through the woods to a collapsed
     building. an old black suv pulls up from the opposite
     direction, facing them.

     two middle-aged chinese men, get out of the back. one
     carries an envelope. at the sight of ray and lila, he
     stops and says something to the other one.

     both turn around and head back to the suv.

     the driver jacques bruno, a large quebecois man, wearing
     a full-length fur coat gets out. they argue. he pulls out
     a long pistol and motions the men to the acclaim.

                            ray
               what the hell is he doing?

     ray reaches for her gun.

                            lila
               keep that thing down.

     bruno walks towards the acclaim.

                            lila (cont'd)
               roll down the window and see what he
               wants.

                            ray
               what the hell is going on here?

                            lila
               just roll it down.

                                                            39.


     bruno stands at ray's window.

     ray slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the
     window. bruno hands her a tim horton's bag. she takes it.

                            bruno
                      (quebec-french accent)
               d'ey don't like de women driver.

     he hands ray the envelope of cash.

                            lila
               count it.

     ray nervously counts the money as the chinese men shiver
     outside.

                            ray
               twelve hundred.

     lila pops the trunk. bruno and the chinese men disappear
     around the back of the acclaim. they hear the trunk
     shut.

     bruno comes back to ray's window and taps on it.

     ray looks at lila.

                            lila
               open it.

     ray rolls down the window again.

                            bruno
               d'is will keep d'em from running.

     he hands her men's shoes and dirty socks.

     ray takes the belongings and rolls up the window and
     drives away.
