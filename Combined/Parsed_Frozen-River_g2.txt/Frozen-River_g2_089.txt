     ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat,
     unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off
     it's clothes. it is a boy.

     she tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response.

                              lila
               it's dead.

     ray keeps giving it air. there is no response but she
     keeps at it. then, between breaths:

                            ray
               tap the bottom of his feet.

                              lila
               why?

                            ray
               that's what they did to get ricky
               breathing when he was born.

     ray puts the baby on lila's lap. she pulls away.

                            lila
               i don't want to touch it.

                            ray
               well, i can't hold it and drive.

                                                              66.


     ray cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby.
     lila stares down at the baby in her lap, not touching it.

                            lila
               i don't think it matters.

                            ray
               at least put him next to your body. that
               will warm him up.

                            lila
               but it's too late.

                            ray
               just do it! we can't give it back to her
               cold.
