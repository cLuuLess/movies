55   ext. ray's trailer yard - day                              55

     the rentaworld men get out of the car and start toward
     the trailer.

     from down the road the acclaim comes roaring along,
     kicking up dust.

     ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men.

                            ray
               it's okay. i got it right here. (she
               waves a wad of fifties and twenties). two
               fifty five, right?

     the men nod, relieved. ray counts out the money.

     ricky bursts out the door and runs towards ray.

                              ricky
               mommy!

                                                           45.


     she catches him in her arms and hugs him. t.j. stands at
     the trailer door, watching as the men drive away.

                            ray
                      (to ricky)
               who wants to go the price chopper and get
               some cap'n crunch?

                             ricky
               i do!

                            ray
               wanna to go to the price chopper?

     t.j. walks out, looking at the money suspiciously.

                            t.j.
               where'd you get that?

                            ray
                      (a beat)
               matt made me an assistant manager.

                             t.j.
               no way.

                            ray
               is that so hard to believe?

                            t.j.
               it's been like two years.

                            ray
               exactly, and that's why he gave me a
               bonus.

     he isn't convinced.

                            ray (cont'd)
               do you wanna go to the price chopper or
               not?

     t.j. gets in the car.
