70   int.   acclaim jimmy's garage lot - night                   70

     ray and lila drive up. jimmy runs out with his jacket
     pulled over his head. he sees lila and signals to the
     garage.

     two figures start toward the car. as they get closer, ray
     sees a man and a woman. both pakistani.

                             ray
                wait. they're not chinese.

                             lila
                they're "pakis."

                             ray
                what does that mean?

                             lila
                they're from pakistan.

                             ray
                well where's that?

                                                      57.


                       lila
          i don't know. what difference does it
          make?

                       ray
          a big difference.

the pakistani couple stand outside the car, shivering and
holding out the cash. the man carries a heavy duffle bag.

ray rolls down the car window. the man holds out money to
ray but she doesn't take it.

                       lila
          if we wait much longer we won't be able
          to get back across the river.

                       ray
          look, i'm not driving just anybody across
          the border.

                       lila
          do you want the money or not?

                       ray
          i wanna know what's in the bag.

ray looks out the car window and points to the bag
speaking loudly.

                       ray (cont'd)
          what's in there?

the man looks at the woman.

                       lila
          they don't understand you.

                       ray
          well, if they want to come over here so
          bad, they ought'a take the time to learn
          english.

lila pops open the trunk.

                       ray (cont'd)
          just hold on a second.

ray gets out.

                                                              58.
