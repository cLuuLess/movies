24   int. acclaim on frozen river - day                          24

     ray stares straight ahead clutching the wheel, barely
     breathing. lila glances at the gun in ray's hand, then
     out at the river, unfazed.

     they reach the midpoint of the river and pass it
     silently.

                            lila
               you gotta pick up some speed to get up
               the bank.

                                                              22.


     ray speeds up. the acclaim bounces up the steep bank.

                               lila (cont'd)
                  it's just on the other side of those
                  trees.
