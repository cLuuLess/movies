     ray and lila return down route 37 past the sign
     "akwesasne, land of the mohawk"

     lila keeps the gun on ray.

                               lila
                  turn down there.

     ray looks at the dirt road leading into the woods.

                                 lila (cont'd)
                  stop here.

     ray stops.

                               lila (cont'd)
                  now open the door.

     ray hesitates. lila jams the gun in her side.

                               lila (cont'd)
                  open the door.

     ray opens the door.

                                 lila (cont'd)
                  now get out.

     ray doesn't move.

                               ray
                  you can't have my car.

                                 lila
                  get out.

                               ray
                  you can't have my car.

     lila tries to push ray out the driver's door with her
     feet.

     ray clings to the steering wheel.

                                                              28.


                            ray (cont'd)
               no!

     suddenly, ray grabs lila by the hair and pulls her head
     down to the car seat. lila hits ray in the head with the
     gun.

                            ray (cont'd)
                      (gasps)
               fuckin' bitch!

     bleeding and holding lila's hair, ray pries the gun out
     of lila's hand. lila grabs the sack of money, jumps out
     of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the
     woods.

     ray chases her, but lila is faster and gets ahead, then
     disappears into the woods. ray stops, panting, and wipes
     the blood from her forehead.

                            ray (cont'd)
                      (calls after her)
               little bitch!

     ray stares after her for a long moment then gets back in
     the acclaim.
