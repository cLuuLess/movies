               jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, 
               honking constantly. evelyn sits between him and o'connell, 
               looking scared and nervous, then she gives o'connell a look.

                                     evelyn
                         you called me your girl?

                                     o'connell

                         you know, figure a speech.

                                     evelyn
                         i think you were jealous

                                     o'connell

                         that guy's face?

               daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                                     daniels
                         shut-up! just shut-up! we gotta do 
                         somethin'! we gotta do somethin, 
                         now! before it's too late!

               they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities.
