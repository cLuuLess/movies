               o'connell., jonathan, daniels, the curator and ardeth ray

                                     evelyn
                         last month i came across an 
                         inscription that mentioned the book 
                         of the dead.

                                     daniels
                         that book we found at hamunaptra?

                                     evelyn
                         yes. i dismissed it, because it talked 
                         about bringing people back from the 
                         dead. a notion i was unwilling to 
                         believe.

                                     o'connell
                         believe it, sister. that's what 
                         brought our buddy back to life.

                                     jonathan
                         and now he's going to use it to bring 
                         his girlfriend back

                                     ardeth ray
                         and if he succeeds, the two of them 
                         together will bring about the 
                         apocalypse.

               the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
               stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                                     the curator
                         the plagues we have seen so far, are 
                         merely imhotep flexing his muscles. 
                         only at the moment of anck-su-namun's 
                         resurrection will he be truly 
                         invincible.

               they reach the display cases. evelyn quickly opens them.

                                     evelyn
                         i'm thinking that if the black book 
                         of the dead can bring people back to 
                         life --

                                     curator
                         -- then perhaps, the golden book of 
                         the living can return them to the 
                         underworld.

                                     evelyn
                         exactly --

                                     o'connell
                         so your sayin', if we find the book 
                         made outta gold --

                                     curator
                         -- and read the sacred incantations 
                         contained inside it.

                                     o'connell
                         you think it'll send this guy back 
                         to hell?

                                     curator
                         correct, and that's when --

               loud chanting is heard coming from outside. they all rush 
               over to the upper windows and look down -- outside: a large, 
               crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores comes chanting 
               up the driveway: 'anck-su-namun! anck-su-namun!'

                                     ardeth ray
                         it has begun. the beginning of the 
                         end.

                                     evelyn
                         not quite yet it hasn't. c'mon.

               evelyn dashes back to the display cases. everyone follows.
