               int. cemetery

               chained tight to the top of the altar, evelyn hopelessly 
               struggles to free herself. she stops as priest mummies start 
               surrounding the altar. evelyn is horrified as the hideous 
               mummies kneel down and begin to chant, -- which now sounds 
               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths 
               in the room.

               imhotep steps up carrying the black book of the dead. his 
               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses anck-su-namun's decayed 
               cheek.
