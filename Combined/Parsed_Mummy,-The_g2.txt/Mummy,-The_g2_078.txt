               int. museum of antiquities - upper balcony - night

               the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the 
               curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

               the others watch. evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                                     evelyn
                         got it!

                                     o'connell
                         got what?

               the banging gets louder. multiple windows shatter. evelyn 
               talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                                     evelyn
                         since the black book of the dead was 
                         found inside the statue of anubis, 
                         then according to this, the golden 
                         book of the living should be inside...

               evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                                     o'connell
                         what?

                                     jonathan
                         what?

                                     daniels
                         what!?

                                     evelyn
                         the golden book of the living, is 
                         inside the statue of horus.

                                     curator
                         which would be located not far to 
                         the east of the anubis statue.

                                     o'connell
                         don't tell me we gotta go back out 
                         there?

                                     curator
                         if we want to kill the creature, 
                         yes.

               two hideous boil & sore-covered men charge out of a doorway, 
               screaming. o'connell and ardeth ray grab them and chuck them 
               over the railing. the men fly through the air and crash into 
               the lower display cases. the front doors suddenly burst open, 
               the crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass 
               across the balcony and down the staircase.
