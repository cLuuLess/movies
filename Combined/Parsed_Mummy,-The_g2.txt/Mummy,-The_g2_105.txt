               ext. plateau - day

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan stand in the middle of the 
               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. they stare off at the 
               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to rumble-ominously.

                                     jonathan
                         well,... i guess we go home empty 
                         handed.

               o'connell looks at evelyn.

                                     o'connell
                         wouldn't say that.

               evelyn returns the look, a beat, and then she wraps-her arms 
               around his neck and kisses him. o'connell returns it.

               jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs 
               up onto a camel.

               when the kiss is over, o'connell and evelyn share a smile, 
               then o'connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs 
               evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. evelyn wraps her 
               arms around his waist. o'connell and jonathan slap the reins.

                                     o'connell/jonathan
                         tuk-tuk-tuk!!

               the camels start to move out. we pan down: to the saddlebag 
               behind evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can 
               see that it's filled with beni's stolen treasure.

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan ride off into the sunset.
