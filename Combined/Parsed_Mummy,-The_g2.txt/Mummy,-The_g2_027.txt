               int. embalmer's chamber - day

               o'connell waves a torch as jonathan, evelyn and the warden 
               drop down next to him. evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                                     evelyn
                         do you realize, we are standing inside 
                         a room that no one has entered in 
                         over four thousand years.

                                     warden
                         who cares? i don't see no treasure.

                                     o'connell
                         you're welcome to my share of the 
                         spider webs.

                                     jonathan
                         and it stinks to high heaven in here.

               evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                                     evelyn
                         cretins.

               jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden 
               and realizes where the smell is coming from. he stops 
               sniffing.

               evelyn brushes cobwebs away from a metal disk on the wall, 
               then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a ray of 
               light shining in from the outer mirrors. -- the ray of light 
               hits the disk and quickly shoots around the room from one 
               disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up. light 
               rays shoot off down the passageways. it's the embalmer's 
               chamber.

                                     o'connell
                         that is a neat trick.

                                     evelyn
                         oh my god, it's a preparation room.

                                     o'connell
                         preparation for what?

                                     evelyn
                         for entering the afterlife.

               o'connell quickly draws his gun. jonathan gently nudges him.

                                     jonathan
                         mummies, my good son, this is where 
                         they made the mummies.

               evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. the others follow.
