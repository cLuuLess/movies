               ext. gallows courtyard - day

               hundreds of filthy prisoners stare down onto the gallows as 
               the hangman's noose is draped over o'connell's head and 
               cinched tight around his neck. evelyn follows the warden 
               onto a balcony above the gallows. the prisoners all go dead 
               quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh 
               meat.

                                     warden
                         no women allowed.

                                     evelyn
                         i am an english woman.

               this seems to confuse the warden, he shrugs and sits down.

               o'connell looks up as evelyn plops down beside the warden.

                                     evelyn
                         i will give you one hundred pounds 
                         to spare his life.

                                     warden
                         i would pay one hundred pounds just 
                         to see him hang.

                                     evelyn
                         two hundred pounds.

                                     warden
                         proceed!

                                     evelyn
                         three hundred pounds!

               o'connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. other than 
               evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. the hangman turns to him.

                                     hangman
                         any last requests, pig?

                                     o'connell
                         yeah, i'd like ya to let me go.

               the hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                                     evelyn
                         five hundred pounds!

               the warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on evelyn's leg.

                                     warden
                         and what else?

               evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

               insulted, the warden angrily turns and gestures to the 
               hangman, who pulls the lever. the trapdoor drops away.

                                     evelyn
                         nooo!

               o'connell drops through the hole. the rope pays out. then 
               jerks taught. o'connell's body snaps at the end of the rope.

               but he's still alive, because --

                                     warden
                         his neck did not break! good! now we 
                         watch him strangle to death.

               the prisoners go ape-shit, screaming and shouting in anger.

               the guards look around, nervous. o'connell struggles at the 
               end of the rope, gagging. evelyn is horrified, she quickly 
               turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                                     evelyn
                         he knows the location to hamunaptra.

               the warden spins around and faces her.

                                     warden
                         you lie.

                                     evelyn
                         i would never!

               at the end of the rope, o'connell is choking and gagging and 
               turning several shades of red. the warden stares at evelyn.

                                     warden
                         are you saying this filthy godless 
                         son of a pig knows where to find the 
                         city of the dead? truly?

                                     evelyn
                         yes and if you cut him down, we will 
                         give you ten percent.

                                     warden
                         fifty percent.

                                     evelyn
                         twenty.

                                     warden
                         forty.

               evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. o'connell's eyes bulge as 
               he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                                     o'connell
                         give... give him... give him glaaaa--
                         !

                                     evelyn
                         twenty-five percent, and not one 
                         single farthing more.

               the warden flashes a big green smile, then yells in arabic. 
               a scimitar slashes the air. the rope is cut. o'connell crashes 
               to the ground. half dead. rolls over. gagging.

               all of the prisoners burst into cheers. o'connell looks up 
               at evelyn. she smiles broadly and waves down at him.

               curator's office - night

               candle light flickers across the curator's face.

                                     curator
                         she must die.

               standing in the shadows across from his desk are three mumia: 
               blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. one 
               of the mumia has a rusty metal hook for a hand. he shrugs.

                                     hook
                         she is like all the others. she will 
                         die in the desert.

                                     curator
                         no! she has seen too much. she knows 
                         too much.

               the curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                                     curator
                         not only does she have a map, but 
                         she has the key.

               spooks the hell out of the mumia guys.

                                     hook
                         the key!? she has the lost key!?

                                     curator
                         yes. no one has ever had so much, 
                         been so close. we must stop her, or 
                         it will be the end of us all.

                                     hook
                         then we will kill her, we will kill 
                         her and all those with her.

                                     curator
                         and burn the map and retrieve the 
                         key.

                                     hook
                         it will be done. but what of the 
                         american expedition? they leave 
                         tomorrow as well.

                                     curator
                         forget the bumbling americans, they 
                         will be like all the others. without 
                         the map to guide them, how can they 
                         possibly find hamunaptra?
