               int. labyrinth corridor - night

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan race down the labyrinth, 
               slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                                     jonathan
                         did you see that!? grasshoppers! 
                         billions of grasshoppers!

                                     o'connell
                         that's one of the plagues, right? 
                         the grasshopper plague!

                                     evelyn
                         this is not a plague. it's 
                         generational. every so many years 
                         the locusts of egypt have a population 
                         explosion and they all take flight.

               evelyn steps forward, something squishes. o'connell lowers 
               his torch, -- the entire floor is filled with slimy frogs.

                                     o'connell
                         okay,... and what about frogs?
