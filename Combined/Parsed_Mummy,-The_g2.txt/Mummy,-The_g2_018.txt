               ext. the bar at the bow - night

               jonathan and the three americans are playing poker. o'connell 
               comes out a door carrying a gunny-sack.

                                     jonathan
                         sit down, o'connell, sit down, we 
                         could use another good player.

                                     o'connell
                         i only gamble with my life, never my 
                         money.

                                     daniels
                         never? what if i were to wager five 
                         hundred dollars says we get to 
                         hamunaptra before you?

               o'connell returns daniel's cocky look.

                                     o'connell
                         yer on.

               burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                                     burns
                         what makes you so confident, sir?

                                     o'connell
                         what makes you?

               henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                                     henderson
                         we got us a man who's actually been 
                         there.

               o'connell's poker face drops, perplexed. same with jonathan.

                                     jonathan
                         i say, what a coincidence, why --

               o'connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the 
               gunnysack, shutting him up. jonathan quickly covers.

                                     jonathan
                         -- whose deal is it? is it my deal? 
                         i thought i just dealt?
