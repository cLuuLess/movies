               int. labyrinth passageway - night

               the americans, beni and the diggers race into a passageway.

               burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground, 
               they get crushed in the stampede. burns staggers to his feet, 
               squinting. blurry figures vanish into the darkness,

                                     burns
