               ext. cairo bazaar - night

               a full moon now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling 
               with activity. suddenly, a breeze kicks-in. green mist begins 
               to swirl down the street and through the stalls. the people 
               begin to choke and cough and retch, as if being hit by a 
               severe sickness -- it's already too late.

               imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted 
               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. beni is at his 
               side, looking very nervous.

               and then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow 
               imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous boils 
               and sores.
