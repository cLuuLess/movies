               ext. giza port - day

               smash cut to: our old traitorous friend beni.

                                     beni
                         it is three days down the nile, then 
                         two days by camel, sahibs.

               we crane back: to reveal beni standing on the bow of a 
               passenger barge. surrounded by daniels, henderson and burns.

                                     daniels
                         for all the money we're paying you, 
                         something better god-damned well be 
                         under that sand.

               we keep craning back: as henderson slaps daniels on the back.

                                     henderson
                         "hamunaptra," daniels, that's all ya 
                         gotta keep sayin, to yourself, 
                         "hamunaptra."

               now we see all of giza port: team of explorers swarm the 
               docks. across the nile, the pyramids spike the sky. evelyn 
               and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers 
               selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures.

                                     evelyn
                         do you really think he'll show up?

                                     jonathan
                         undoubtedly, i know the breed, he 
                         may be a cowboy, but his word is his 
                         word.

                                     evelyn
                         personally, i think he's filthy, 
                         rude and a complete scoundrel. i 
                         don't like him one bit.

                                     o'connell (o.s.)
                         anyone i know?

               they both turn. o'connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit 
               and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. he looks more 
               dashing and handsome than ever. evelyn is suitably impressed.

                                     evelyn
                         oh... um,... hello.

               jonathan grabs o'connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                                     jonathan
                         smashing day for the start of an 
                         adventure, eh, o'connell?

               o'connell quickly checks his pockets.

                                     o'connell
                         yeah, sure, smashing.

               he finds his wallet and relaxes. directly above him: on the 
               bow of the barge, burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni.

                                     burns
                         you're sure hamunaptra is out there?

                                     beni
                         along with the scorched bones of my 
                         entire garrison, sahib.

               and that's when beni spots o'connell. beni shakes his head, 
               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the 
               men.

                                     beni
                         a thousand pardons, my good sahibs 
                         but there is much work to be done.

               beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

               back down with: evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                                     evelyn
                         mister o'connell, can you look me in 
                         the eye, and guarantee me this is 
                         not some sort of flimflam? because 
                         if it is, i'm warning you --

               o'connell steps up close to evelyn, invading her space looks 
               her straight in the eye. evelyn doesn't back away.

                                     o'connell
                         all i can tell you, miss, is that my 
                         colonel found that map in an ancient 
                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison 
                         believed in it so much, that without 
                         orders, we marched halfway across 
                         libya and into egypt to find that 
                         city. like i told ya, all i saw was 
                         sand. everybody else was wiped out 
                         by tuareg warriors. i'll take your 
                         bags.

               o'connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
               the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on.

               evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. jonathan sees it.

                                     jonathan
                         yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, 
                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to 
                         like there at all.

               evelyn gives him a look. jonathan just grins. and that's 
               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy 
               hat.

                                     warden
                         a bright good morning to all.

                                     evelyn
                         what are you doing here?

                                     warden
                         i have come to protect my investment, 
                         thank you very much.

               and up the plank he goes. evelyn and jonathan share a look.

               we go wide again: as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
               nile. we tilt up: to the sun, which then dissolves into --
