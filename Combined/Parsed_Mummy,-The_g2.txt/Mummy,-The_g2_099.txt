               int. horus' chamber - day

               ardeth ray blasts away at the oncoming mummies. over at the 
               base of the statue, o'connell and jonathan pull an ornate 
               chest out of the secret compartment. o'connell rips off the 
               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

               he and jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. then he 
               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the solid gold 
               book of the living -- golden light reflects off their faces 
               as they stare at it in wonder.

               the elephant gun goes empty. ardeth ray takes it by the barrel 
               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                                     ardeth ray
                         save the girl! kill the creature!

               the mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

               o'connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it 
               against the far wall. he and jonathan hit the deck.

                                     o'connell
                         that's the last one, we better get 
                         lucky.

               the wall blows. debris collapses, -- but now here's a hole 
               for them to get out. o'connell and jonathan race out through 
               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.
