               int. imhotep's chamber - day

               o'connell and jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the 
               ceiling. evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                                     evelyn
                         according to my calculations, we 
                         should be right under the statue. 
                         we'll come up right between his legs.
                              (she blushes and laughs)
                         oh my.

                                     jonathan
                         and when those dirty yanks go to 
                         sleep --
                              (looks at o'connell)
                         no offense.

                                     o'connell
                         none taken.

                                     jonathan
                         we'll sneak up and steal that book 
                         right out from under them.

                                     o'connell
                         and you're sure you can find the 
                         secret compartment?

                                     evelyn
                         yes, if their egyptologist hasn't 
                         already found it.

               jonathan looks around.

                                     jonathan
                         i say, what's our smelly little friend 
                         got himself up to?
