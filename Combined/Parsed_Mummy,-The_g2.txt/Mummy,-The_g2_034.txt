               int. imhotep's chamber - day

               the dust is starting to clear. o'connell, evelyn and jonathan 
               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

               we immediately recognize it as imhotep's sarcophagus.

                                     evelyn
                         oh my god,... it looks like, it looks 
                         like a sarcophagus.

                                     o'connell
                         why would they bury somebody in the 
                         ceiling?

                                     evelyn
                         they didn't, they buried him at the 
                         foot of anubis. he was either someone 
                         of great importance. or he did 
                         something very naughty.
