               int. curator's office - day

               the curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's 
               eyepiece at the key/box. evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                                     evelyn
                         see the cartouche there, it's the 
                         official royal seal of seti the first, 
                         i'm sure of it.

                                     curator
                         perhaps.

               jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                                     jonathan
                         two questions. who the hell is seti 
                         the first? and was he rich?

                                     evelyn
                         he was the last pharaoh of the old 
                         kingdom, said to be the wealthiest 
                         pharaoh of them all.

                                     jonathan
                         alright, good, that's good. i like 
                         this fellow, like him very much.

               the curator picks up the map. it's actually the exact same 
               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                                     evelyn
                         i've already dated it, this map is 
                         almost four thousand years old. and 
                         the hieratics over here...
                              (inhales deeply)
                         it's hamunaptra.

               the curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

                                     curator
                         my dear girl, don't be ridiculous, 
                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. 
                         hamunaptra is a myth.

                                     jonathan
                         are we talking about the hamunaptra?

                                     evelyn
                         yes. the city of the dead. where the 
                         early pharaohs were said to have 
                         hidden the wealth of egypt.

                                     jonathan
                         right, right, in a big underground 
                         treasure chamber. everybody knows 
                         the story. the entire necropolis was 
                         rigged to sink into the sand. on 
                         pharaoh's command, a flick of the 
                         switch! and the whole place could 
                         disappear beneath the dunes.

                                     evelyn
                         all we know is that the city 
                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 
                         b.c.

               the curator holds the map closer to the burning candle-lamp.

                                     curator
                         as the americans would say: it's all 
                         fairy tales and hokum.

               the map 'accidentally,' catches on fire. the curator throws 
               it to the floor. jonathan drops to his knees and quickly 
               puts it out. lifts it up. the left third of the map is now 
               missing.

                                     jonathan
                         you burned it! you burned off the 
                         part with the lost city!

                                     curator
                         it's for the best, i'm sure. many 
                         men have wasted their lives in the 
                         foolish pursuit of hamunaptra, no 
                         one has ever found it, most have 
                         never returned.

                                     jonathan
                              (devastated)
                         you killed my map.

                                     curator
                         i'm sure it was a fake, anyway, i'm 
                         surprised at you, miss carnarvon, to 
                         be so fooled.

               the curator reaches for the key/box. evelyn quickly snatches 
               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.
