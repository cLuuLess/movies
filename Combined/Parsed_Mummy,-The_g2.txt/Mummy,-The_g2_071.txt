               ext. bazaar - day for night

               down in the bazaar, people are screaming and quickly backing 
               away from the shriveled corpse of the egyptologist.

               a partially decayed hand reaches down and takes the sacred 
               canopic jar out of the egyptologist's shriveled hand. it's 
               imhotep, having regenerated even further. he looks up and 
               catches eyes with o'connell. imhotep grins, then unhinges; 
               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a 
               huge swarm of flies comes out of his mouth and races straight 
               up at o'connell and jonathan. they both slam the shutters.

               the flies slam into the closed window and immediately spread 
               throughout the bazaar. sending people screaming and running.

               egyptologist's office - day for night

               o'connell and jonathan look at each other, panicked.

                                     o'connell
                         damn-it! that's two down and only 
                         two to go.

                                     jonathan
                         and then he'll be coming after evy.

               they turn and race out of the office.

               british fort - window --night

               daniels stares out a window, watching the british guards at 
               the front gate. more soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                                     soldier
                         ten o'clock! all is well!
