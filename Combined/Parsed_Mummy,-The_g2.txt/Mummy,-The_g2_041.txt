               int. imhotep's chamber - day

               evelyn's hand slips the key into the sarcophagus, lock and 
               turns it. a series of strange mechanical-like sounds are 
               heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a giant hiss.

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan all look very, very hungover.

               they start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

               pushing, shoving and groaning, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                                     evelyn
                         i can't believe i allowed the two of 
                         you to get me drunk.

                                     jonathan
                         don't blame me, i don't even remember 
                         being there.

                                     evelyn
                         well neither do i, thank you.

               o'connell gives her a hurt look.

                                     o'connell
                         you don't?

               evelyn gives o'connell a nervous look.

                                     evelyn
                         no... why?... should i?

                                     o'connell
                         gee, yeah, you told me it was the 
                         best time you ever had.

               o'connell gives her a big cheesy smile. evelyn's face drops, 
               appalled and embarrassed. and that's when the lid falls off 
               and loudly crashes to the ground. all three of them instantly 
               grab their sore heads and moan.
