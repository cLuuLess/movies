               int. imhotep's chamber - day

               o'connell, evelyn and jonathan slowly creep forward and 
               carefully look back inside imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

                                     o'connell
                         is he supposed to look like that?

                                     evelyn
                         no. i've never seen a mummy look 
                         like this. he's, he's still...

                                     jonathan
                         juicy?

                                     evelyn
                         yes. he's more than four thousand 
                         years old and still decomposing.

                                     o'connell
                         and look at this.

               o'connell points at the inside of the coffin lid, where there 
               are fingernail scratches and dried blood all over the inside.

                                     evelyn
                         oh my god, he was buried alive.

               this sends a chill through everyone. evelyn leans in closer.

                                     evelyn
                         and he left a message.

               we push in on a grouping of hieratics written in blood.

                                     evelyn
                         it says: 'death is only the 
                         beginning.'

               jonathan shivers. o'connell looks around.

                                     o'connell
                         where's my gun?

                                     jonathan
                         what are you going to do? shoot him?

                                     o'connell
                         if he decides to wake up, hell yes!
