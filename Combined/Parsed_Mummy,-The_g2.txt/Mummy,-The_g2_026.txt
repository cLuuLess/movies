               ext. our heroes dig - day

               o'connell, evelyn, jonathan and the warden are working next 
               to a narrow crevice, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

               o'connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
               the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. jonathan 
               bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he yelps 
               and backs away. it's the decrepit face of anubis.

                                     jonathan
                         that thing gives me the creeps.

                                     o'connell
                         be nice. that thing saved my life.

               evelyn is positioning ancient mirrors along the crevice.

                                     evelyn
                         that "thing" gets me excited.

                                     o'connell
                              (sarcastic)
                         the things that get you excited.

                                     evelyn
                         according to bembridge scholars, 
                         inside the statue of anubis was a 
                         secret compartment, perhaps containing 
                         the book of the living.

                                     o'connell
                         what are those mirrors for?

                                     evelyn
                         ancient egyptian trick. you'll see.

               o'connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.
