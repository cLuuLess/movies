               int. anubis' chamber - day

               several fear-filled, sweaty-faced diggers reach into the 
               secret compartment. henderson and burns hold guns on them.

               daniels has his arm in a sling. the diggers slowly pull out 
               the ornate chest. they set the chest down on the sandy floor.

               beni watches as the egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                                     egyptologist
                         there is a curse upon this chest.

                                     daniels
                         curse my ass.

                                     henderson
                         yeah, who cares.

               the egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                                     egyptologist
                         in these hallowed grounds, that which 
                         was set forth in ancient times, is 
                         as strong today, as it was then.

                                     henderson
                         yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

               the egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                                     egyptologist
                         "death will come on swift wings to 
                         whomever opens this chest".

               a gust of wind blows through the chamber. torches flicker 
               all the diggers suddenly turn tail and run off screaming.

               the americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                                     egyptologist
                         it says, there is one, the undead, 
                         who if brought back to life, is bound 
                         by sacred law to consummate this 
                         curse.

                                     henderson
                         yeah, well, let's just make sure we 
                         don't bring anybody back from the 
                         dead then, huh?

               the three americans laugh.

                                     egyptologist
                         he will kill all who open this 
                         chest,... and assimilate their organs 
                         and fluids.

                                     daniels
                         assimilate their organs and fluids? 
                         ya mean eat 'em?

                                     egyptologist
                         and in so doing he will regenerate. 
                         and no longer be the undead, but a 
                         plague upon this earth.

               the wind whistles. torches flicker. very spooky. beni and 
               the egyptologist share a fear-filled look. henderson just 
               shrugs.

                                     henderson
                         ah hell, let's open it anyways.
