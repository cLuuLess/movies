               ext. museum of antiquity - night

               jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
               convertible. suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob 
               comes around the side of the museum. jonathan instantly bugs 
               his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins chanting --

                                     jonathan
                         anck-su-namun! anck-su-namun!

               the crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
               of the museum. jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it 
               up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

               o'connell, evelyn, daniels, ardeth ray and the curator jump 
               inside the car. beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                                     beni
                         imhotep! imhotep!

               imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
               windows just as the convertible peels out. o'connell points 
               a finger at beni as they race past him.

                                     o'connell
                         you're gonna get yours, pal!

               imhotep unhinges his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial shrieks.

               his disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out 
               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.
