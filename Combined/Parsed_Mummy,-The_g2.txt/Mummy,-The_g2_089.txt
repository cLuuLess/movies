               int. cemetery - day

               the gunshot echoes into the cemetery as imhotep, evelyn and 
               beni step-up to the strange altar, where four thousand years 
               ago imhotep tried to bring anck-su-namun back to life.

               imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a canopic 
               jar. he pulls out the crusted remains of anck-su-namun's 
               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading 
               from the book of the dead. then he blows the dust against a 
               mausoleum wall, -- the wall starts to come alive.

               evelyn and beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

               two forms emerge from the mausoleum's wall. horrific-looking 
               mummified corpses. two of imhotep's long dead priests.

               they bow to imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.
