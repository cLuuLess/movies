               int. anubis' chamber - day

               henderson and daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
               chest. beni and the egyptologist watch. in the background, 
               beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                                     beni
                         the curse,... beware the curse!

               beni turns and bolts from the chamber. daniels spits.

                                     daniels
                         stupid superstitious bastard.

               and that's when the seal breaks, -- a black vapor blasts out 
               of the chest. everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.
