	int. hallway - day
	
	woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with marsha
	and theresa. karl stands down the way a few feet with melvin.
	
	                    marsha 
	          is he leaving right this minute?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          we've got some paperwork to take
	          care of. pretty soon. don't worry,
	          you won't run into him in the
	          parking lot.
	
	                    marsha 
	          i didn't mean that.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          i hope the best for you, miss
	          dwiggins, with your school and your
	          paper and all.
	
	                    marsha 
	          where will he go?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          wherever he wants to. i think he's
	          going back to millsburg where he's
	          from. it's just about twenty miles
	          from here.
	
	                    marsha 
	          will he be supervised?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          as much as anybody else is, i
	          guess. y'all have a good rest of
	          the day now.
	
	marsha and theresa walk toward the exit. as they pass karl he
	speaks to marsha.
	
	                    karl
	              (looking down)
	          thank you.
	
	                    marsha
	              (immediately extends her
	               hand) 
	          thank you.
	
	karl doesn't take her hand.
	
	karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit.
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon i'm gonna have to get used
	          to looking at pretty people.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          yes, i guess you are.
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon i'm gonna have to get used
	          to them lookin' at me, too.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          you better go get your things.
	
	                    karl 
	          i ain't got nothing but them books.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          you better go get 'em.
	
	                    karl 
	          all right then.
	
	karl walks slowly down the hallway.
