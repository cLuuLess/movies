	ext. street - day
	
	karl is walking down a residential street. he stops in front
	of the house where the boy, frank, lives and stares at the
	house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares
	at it. a curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the
	window. he comes and opens the door.
	
	                    frank
	          hey there. i thought i heard
	          somebody on the porch. wasn't your
