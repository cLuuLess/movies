	int. house - day
	
	as frank and karl enter, they see doyle sitting on a
	footstool facing linda who's in a chair. doyle is holding
	both her hands and talking very softly to her. he sees the
	guys and looks up.
	
	                    doyle 
	          well, i'll be damned, there's the
	          boys. i'm glad y'all came in. i
	          wanted to talk to y'all, too. i was
	          just tellin' linda here -- oh hell,
	          i'll just start over, set down you
	          boys.
	
	they do, on the couch.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          well, what it is is, i just, well i
	          took off work early today and your
	          mama was good enough to do the same
	          so we could talk. i guess you'd say
	          i'm really here to apologize, which
	          ain't easy for me to do, about the
	          way i acted the other night. i was
	          just drunk and kinda got a little
	          too worked up and one thing led to
	          another. i care about y'all a lot,
	          i do. i don't mean to be so damned,
	          assholish i guess the word would
	          be. now karl, i don't believe i hit
	          you, did i? so no apology needed
	          there i guess, but frank, i'm
	          sorry. i'm sorry i hit your mama.
	          i'm just jealous of her. i don't
	          like her life or the way she runs
	          it. i don't like homosexuals and
	          she buddies with one. i don't like
	          little wimpy ass kids or fuckin'
	          mental retards and she's got one of
	          each livin' with her. 
	              (laughs)
	          i was just kiddin'. but really i
	          guess people need to get along even
	          if they have differences. 
	              (pause)
	          you see, i work construction. i
	          build things. do you realize how
	          important that is to the world. i
	          have a lot of pressure on me. the
	          upshot is, i'm gonna spend a lot
	          more time over here and we're gonna
	          get along. like a family should. 
	              (to linda)
	          i may even surprise you one day and
	          pop the question. 
	              (he gets up)
	          well, i'm goin' back to work. i
	          just wanted to give y'all some
	          little piece of happiness today. 
	              (kisses linda)
	          see you tonight honey. karl. be a
	          good boy, frank.
	
	he leaves.
	
	                    linda
	          well, at least he's tryin'. but who
	          knows for how long.
	
	                    frank 
	          he's lyin' mama. he ain't gonna do
	          better.
	
	                    linda 
	          i know honey. just remember what i
	          said, we'll bide our time. you just
	          steer clear of him as much as you
	          can. doyle's had a real hard life.
	          it's just about run him crazy i
	          think.
	
	                    frank 
	          we've had a real hard life, too,
	          mama.
	
	linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around frank.
	
	                    linda 
	          you're a hell of a boy, frank.
	          someday you're gonna get all the
	          good things you deserve. and karl
	          here's gonna get some more biscuits
	          tonight. what do you think about
	          that?
	
	                    karl 
	          i could shore use some. thank ye.
