	close up on karl's face. charles has started another
	monologue.
	
	                    charles 
	          there was a young man named john
	          liggit hunter who was in the
	          filling station business and a good
	          filling station business. he was
	          one of those young men that we run
	          across so often in life. i'm sure
	          you've run across them, that didn't
	          deserve the things he had. one of
	          those things was his beautiful
	          bride, sarah. she was a georgia
	          peach. as a matter of fact she
	          looked more like the picture i've
	          had in my head than any woman i've
	          ever seen. i took it upon myself to
	          take her away from john liggit
	          hunter, who didn't deserve her. i'm
	          not sure if i mentioned that he was
	          a frenchman who claimed to be an
	          englishman. it took some very
	          strong nylon cord to take her away
	          from him. she was a fighter as well
	          as a georgia peach.
