	int. an office - day
	
	jerry woolridge stands up from behind the desk as they enter.
	he's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop
	class or perhaps eighth-grade science.
	
	                    guard
	          these are the people from that
	          newspaper deal.
	
	                    woolridge
	          oh yeah, from the college?
	
	                    marsha
	          yes sir.
	
	woolridge shakes hands with them. 
	
	                    woolridge
	          my name's jerry woolridge.
	
	                    marsha
	          nice to meet you. i'm marsha
	          dwiggins and this is theresa evans.
	          she's here to take the pictures.
	
	                    woolridge
	          y'all have a seat. is this all of
	          you?
	
	                    marsha
	          yes sir.
	
	                    woolridge
	          i think there must have been a
	          little mix up. i told your sponsor
	          or teacher or whatever he is, there
	          couldn't be any pictures. it's
	          s'posed to be just a little story
	          or article or something, isn't that
	          right?
	
	                    marsha
	          well, yeah, it's for the school
	          newspaper. but it has pictures. i
	          mean it's a regular paper, you
	          know. 
	
	                    woolridge
	          karl's real sensitive about having
	          his picture made. he wouldn't even
	          be on the bulletin board for the
	          easter collage. 
	              (to guard) 
	          melvin, would you get me a good hot
	          cup with two sugar substitutes? you
	          girls want some coffee?
	
	                    marsha 
	          no thank you.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          the other thing is i told your boss
	          on the phone to send a man. karl
	          won't talk to women.
