	int. woolridge's office - day
	
	karl finds woolridge doing paper work. woolridge looks up
	startled.
	
	                    woolridge
	          karl, what in the world are you
	          doing here?
	
	                    karl 
	          i want to come back and stay here.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          well, you can't do that. you're a
	          free man. you've been let out to do
	          as you please.
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon i don't care nothin' about
	          bein' a free man. i don't know how
	          to go about it.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          well, you have to learn. it'll take
	          some time. don't you know anybody
	          down there to help you out?
	
	                    karl 
	          naw.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          your daddy's still livin' down
	          there from what you told me. 
	              (pause)
	          i guess he wouldn't help you any,
	          would he? i wasn't thinking. you
	          don't know anybody?
	
	                    karl 
	          naw. never did know too much of
	          nobody. not to he'p me out anyway.
	
	                    woolridge
	              (sighs)
	          listen, karl, the truth is i don't
	          know where they expect you to go or
	          what they expect you to do. if it
	          was up to me, i'd let you stay here
	          if that's what you wanted. i'm just
	          doin' my job. 
	              (they sit in silence for a
	               moment)
	          you follow me? 
	              (no answer)
	          listen, i know an old boy that runs
	          a fix-it shop deal down in
	          millsburg. he used to go to church
	          with me. you're good workin' on
	          small engines and things. if i put
	          my neck out for you with him, will
	          you work at it if he'll hire you?
	
	                    karl 
	          i'm pretty handy i reckon on lawn
	          mowers and whatnot.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          i know, i've seen it myself. would
	          you give that a try?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          i can't promise he'll hire you.
	          i'll have to tell him about your
	          history.
	
	                    karl 
	          i never was no good with history.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          no, i mean your past. about why you
	          were in here. 
	              (pause)
	          i'll take you first thing in the
	          mornin'. you have anyplace you can
	          stay tonight at all?
	          i just can't let you stay here.
	          it's the rules. if something
	          happened well, i'd be liable.
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon i can just walk around
	          till the mornin'. or set and read
	          me a book somewhere.
	
	they sit and stare at each other for a moment.
