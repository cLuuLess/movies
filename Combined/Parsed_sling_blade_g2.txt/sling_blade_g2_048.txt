	int. living room - night
	
	linda cleaning up the last of the mess. frank comes in sleepy
	eyed in his pajamas.
	
	                    linda 
	          what are you doin' up again, frank?
	          you need to get a little sleep.
	
	                    frank 
	          did vaughan go home?
	
	                    linda 
	          yeah, he has to go to work in a
	          little while. i do too.
	
	                    frank
	          did karl go to bed?
	
	                    linda
	          i guess. he went to the garage.
	          poor thing, he's probably never
	          seen such a crazy mess. he probably
	          wants to go back and live in mr.
	          cox's shop.  
	
	                    frank
	          i bet he don't. karl likes me. 
	
	                    linda
	          i know he does.
	
	                    frank
	          mama?
	
	                    linda
	          huh?
	
	                    frank
	          is everything gonna be all right
	          someday? i just stay nervous all
	          the time just about. 
	
	                    linda
	          yeah, honey, someday everything's
	          gonna be all right.
	
	                    frank
	          doyle wouldn't really kill you,
	          would he?
	
	                    linda
	          i promise we're gonna get away from
	          him. the time has to be right,
	          that's all. i'd rather him get
	          tired of me and leave me. then he
	          wouldn't want to hurt me. he
	          wouldn't care then. we'll be fine.
	          i promise. you go to bed now. 
	              (she hugs him)
	          i love you.
	
	                    frank 
	          i love you, too, mama.
	
	he goes to his room.
