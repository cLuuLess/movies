	int. backyard - night
	
	white christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. karl
	sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground
	alongside vaughan, frank, and linda. the "band" is set up on
	the patio. the band consists of morris, a heavyset guy in a
	military uniform on tambourine, terence, a skinny guy in a
	wheelchair on bass, randy, a long haired younger guy who's
	not an indian on guitar, doyle on a guitar which he can't
	play and monty "the johnson " johnson, a large guy with a zz
	top beard on drums. a tub of beer is in front of them.
	they're all hooting and hollering and drinking. they've
	obviously been at it for a while. doyle steps forward to
	address the 'crowd.'
	
	                    doyle 
	          okay ladies and gentlemen 
	              (points to vaughan)

	          our show when we like to introduce
	          the band. over here on lead guitar
	          mr. randy horsefeathers. come on
	          hit a hot lick, randy. 
	              (randy plays a lick)
	          well, come on, y'all are supposed
	          to clap now. come on! 
	              (they clap a little except
	               for karl)
	
	angle on linda
	
	                    linda 
	          karl, you better clap your hands or
	          he'll just keep on.
	
	karl claps his hands a little.
	
	                    doyle 
	          on the bass, give it up for terence
	          "one ball" atkins. 
	              (more half-assed clapping)
	          on the tambourine and lyrics morris
	          hobbs the fuckin' genius of the
	          group. 
	              (claps)
	          on drums "the johnson." 
	              (claps)
	          and last and most importantly,
	          doyle hargraves on rhythm guitar
	          and business affairs and the only
	          motherfucker with a truck big
	          enough to haul this outfit on the
	          next world fuckin' tour. come on, a
	          big hand for these guys. they're
	          workin' their asses off here. 
	              (pauses for a slug of
	               beer)
	          okay i'd like to dedicate this next
	          one to some very special people in
	          our audience tonight. to my lovely
	          female companion linda, her lovely
	          son frank, our new boarder karl -
	          what's your last name karl?
	
	                    karl 
	          childers.
	
	                    doyle 
	          karl childers just in from the
	          state facility. make one of them
	          gruntin' sounds karl or whatever it
	          is you do. 
	              (nothing)
	          oh well, karl's a little retarded,
	          he don't know what the hell i'm
	          talkin' about. and to vaughan who
	          fucks a mortician in the rear
	          entrance right in front of his
	          clients. now that takes balls. our
	          number one tune for the folks,
	          boys. kick it off johnson!
	
	they play "walk don't run" while the audience of four sits in
	motionless silence. they finish the song and hoot and holler
	and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          you like that vaughan?
	
	                    vaughan
	          sure. it sounded like a number one
	          tune all right.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you enjoying yourself, karl?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon.
	
	we hear the voice of an old man neighbor in the near
	distance.
	
	                    voice (o.s.) 
	          i wished you all would lay off for
	          tonight. i can't hear myself think
	          for that racket. it's nighttime,
	          now let folks be! i'll call the
	          law!
	
	                    doyle
	              (hollers back)

	          laws on my side. i play cards with
	          j.d. shelnutt, chief' of police.

	              (to the party)

	          clean up and get a tarpaulin over
	          this instruments. me and the boys

	          late. i have to work tomorrow.

	          come on, don't be a pussy.
	          everybody has to work.
	
	                    linda 
	          he don't want to doyle. don't go
	          vaughan if you don't want to.
	          you'll wreck doyle, you're drunk.
	
	                    doyle
	              (very sincere)
	          but honey, i'll be good. i promise.

	          to help these two be part of
