	ext. covs parking lot - day
	
	bill cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man.
	bill is trying to crank it up, but it won't start. a car
	pulls into the parking lot and gerry woolridge gets out of it
	and comes over to bill.
	
	                    bill 
	          how 'bout you, jerry.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          how are you, bill?
	
	                    bill 
	          doin' pretty good. got a sick
	          tiller here. what's got you down
	          this way?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          just thought i'd check on karl and
	          see if everything's working out.
	
	                    bill 
	          well, he's pretty quiet. except for
	          them rackets and breathin' things
	          he does. ain't threatened me with a
	          killin' or anything. 
	              (laughs)
	          but boy you couldn't of been more
	          right about him fixin' things. that
	          son of a bitch is a regular eli
	          whitney on a lawnmower. loves
	          french fries. eats four larges and
	          don't even so much as belch. i'm
	          proud to have him.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          is him stayin' here workin' out?
	
	                    bill 
	          he's gone to stayin' over with that
	          wheatley boy and his mama in their
	          garage. i think that little boy
	          adopted him damn near like a
	          mascot. but he's got a key here to
	          come and go as he pleases.
	          everything's worked out good.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          can i see him?
	
	                    bill 
	          sure.
	
	bill looks over at scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on
	new mowers in the front window.
	
	                    bill (cont'd)
	          scooter! run get karl for me.
