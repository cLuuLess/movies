	they walk in silence for a while before the boy finally
	speaks.

	          around with you.
	
	                    karl
	          ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
	
	                    frank
	          don't you live somewhere?
	
	                    karl
	          i did live there in the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    frank
	          why'd you live there?
	
	                    karl
	          i killed some folks quite awhile
	          back. they said i wadn't right in
	          the head and they put me in there
	          in the nervous hospital instead of
	          puttin' me in jail.
	
	                    frank
	          they let you out?
	
	                    karl
	          yeah.
	
	                    frank
	          how come?
	
	                    karl 
	          they told me i was well. they had
	          to turn me loose.
	
	                    frank
	          are you well?
	
	                    karl
	          i reckon i feel all right.
	
	                    frank
	          you don't seem like you'd kill
	          nobody.
	
	they reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up
	the sidewalk.
	
	                    frank (cont'd)
	          this is my house. you can just set
	          those bags on the porch.
	
	karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each
	other in silence for a moment.
	
	                    frank (cont'd)
	          do you like to play football?
	
	                    karl
	          i never was much count at it. i
	          never did get picked out fer it.
	
	                    frank
	          me and the burnett twins and some
	          boys plays down at the junior high
	          practice field all the time. if you
	          ever want to come by and play. we
	          ain't no good either. well, i'll
	          see you later.
	
	he goes inside leaving karl staring at the front door.
