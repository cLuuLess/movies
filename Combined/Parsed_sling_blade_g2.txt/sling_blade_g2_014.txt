	marsha is staring at karl. karl, still breathing and rubbing
	his palms, starts to speak. his voice is low and raspy, but
	not just low and raspy; strange.
	
	                    karl 
	          well, i reckon what you're a
	          wanting to know is what i'm doing
	          in here. i reckon the reason i'm in
	          here is 'cause i killed somebody.
	          but i reckon what you was a wanting
	          to know is how come me to kill
	          somebody. well, i reckon i'll start
	          at the front and tell you. 
	              (pause, heavy breathing)
	          i lived most of my life out behind
	          my mother and father's house in a
	          little old shed and my daddy'd
	          built for me. they didn't too much
	          want me up there in the house with
	          the rest of 'em. i mostly just set
	          around out there in the shed all
	          the time a lookin' at the ground.
	          it didn't have no floor but i had
	          me a hole dug out to lay down in
	          and a quilt or tow that i put down
	          there. 
	              (pause, more breathing)
	          my daddy was a hard workin' man
	          most of his life, not that i can
	          say the same fer myself. i most
	          just set around the shed and
	          tinkered around with a lawn mower
	          or two and went to school off and
	          on from time to time but the
	          children there made quite a bit of
	          sport of me, made fun of me quite a
	          bit. some of 'em roughed me up
	          sometimes so mostly i stayed out
	          back there in the shed. my daddy
	          worked down at the sawmill there,
	          down there at the planer mill for
	          an old man named dixon.
	          old man dixon was a very cruel
	          feller, he didn't treat his
	          employees very well, didn't pay 'em
	          much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
	          much of a wage, just barely enough
	          to get by on. but i reckon he got
	          by all right, they come out one or
	          the other of 'em, usually my
	          mother, and fed me pretty regular.
	          at least i know he made enough for
	          me to have mustard and biscuits
	          three or four times a week. old man
	          dixon had a boy named jesse dixon.
	          jesse was really more cruel than
	          his daddy. he made quite a bit of
	          sport of me and takened advantage
	          of the little girls around the
	          neighborhood quite a bit. 
	              (pause)
	          he used to say my mother was a very
	          pretty woman. he said it quite a
	          bit from time to time, when i was
	          at the school house. well, i reckon
	          you want me to get on and tell you
	          what happened so i reckon i'll tell
	          you. i was settin' out in the shed
	          one evenin' not doin' too much,
	          just kindly starin' at the wall and
	          a waitin' fer my mother to come out
	          and give me my bible lesson and i
	          heared a commotion up in the house
	          there so i got up and run up on the
	          screened-in porch there to see what
	          was a goin' on, and i looked in the
	          kitchen window and i seen my mother
	          a layin' there on the floor without
	          any clothes on. 
	              (pause, breathing)
	          and seen jesse dixon a layin' on
	          top of her having his way with her. 
	              (pause)
	          well, i just seen red. i picked up
	          a kaiser blade that was a layin'
	          there by the screen door, some
	          folks calls it a sling blade, i
	          call it a kaiser blade. it's just a
	          long handle like a axe handle with
	          a long blade on it that's shaped
	          kind of like a banana. sharp on one
	          edge and dull on the other. it's
	          what the highway boys use to cut
	          down weeds and whatnot.
	          i went in the kitchen there and i
	          hit jesse dixon up side the head
	          with it and knocked him off my
	          mother. i reckon that didn't quite
	          satisfy me so i hit him again in
	          the neck with the sharp edge and
	          just plumb near cut his head off.
	          killed him. well, my mother, she
	          jumped up from there and started
	          yellin', "what did you kill jesse
	          fer? what did you kill jesse fer?"
	              (pause, intense breathing)
	          well, come to find out my mother
	          didn't really mind what jesse was a
	          doin' to her. i reckon that made me
	          madder than what jesse had made me.
	          i takened the kaiser blade, some
	          folks calls it a sling blade, i
	          call it a kaiser blade and hit my
	          mother up side the head with it an'
	          killed her.
	              (long pause, breathing)
	          some folks has asked me if i had it
	          to do over again would i do the
	          same thing. i don't know, i reckon
	          i would. anyhow, they seen fit to
	          put me in here and here i've been
	          for a great long while. i've
	          learned to read some; took me four
	          years to read the bible. i reckon i
	          understand a good deal of it. it
	          wasn't what i expected in a lot of
	          places. i've slept in a good bed
	          for a great long while. they've
	          seen fit to put me out now. they
	          tell me they're a settin' me free
	          today. anyhow, i reckon that's all
	          you need to know. if you want any
	          more details i reckon i can tell
	          'em to you. i don't know if that's
	          enough for your newspaper or not.
	
	suddenly marsha speaks from the darkness.
	
	                    marsha 
	          will you ever kill anybody again,
	          karl?
	
	this seems to startle the very room itself. woolridge motions
	for marsha to shut up and karl stops still. very still. he
	breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. he seems
	almost at ease. he slowly looks up. from karl's point of view
	we barely see marsha's face in the dim light. karl is looking
	straight at marsha.
	
	                    karl 
	              (slowly)
	          i don't reckon i got no reason to
	          kill nobody.
