	                    doyle
	              (points to tape player)
	          not that you afflicted sons of
	          bitches would know anything about
	          it, but this is art.
	
	they are stopped by a red traffic light. a police car pulls
	up beside them and doyle looks over at the red-faced cop on
	the passenger side and turns down the music.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          hey freddy, what's goin' on boy. i
	          seen your pitcher in the paper for
	          catchin' that big-ass bass.
	
	                    freddy 
	          yeah she was a big 'un. you ain't
	          drunk drivin' are you doyle?
	
	                    doyle 
	          yeah.
	
	                    freddy 
	          i figured that. well you better be
	          careful with that cripple in the
	          back. you'll throw him out. looks
	          like you got a wagonful.
	
	                    doyle 
	          we run outta somethin' to drink.
	          goin' to the county line. you want
	          to race?
	
	                    freddy
	              (laughing)

	          duty. catch me in that camaro next
	          week one night.
	
	                    doyle 
	          catch you later freddy!
	
	doyle peels out and the music blares again.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          i bet you like sittin' between two
	          men in a dual wheel truck don't
	          you?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          oh, yeah, i'm thrilled.
	
	                    doyle 
	          sarcastic right? 
	              (pause)

	          probably gonna stay over tonight.
	          we'd be glad to have you.
