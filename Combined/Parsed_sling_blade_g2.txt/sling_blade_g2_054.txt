	int. cox's shop - day
	
	karl is on the floor working on a mower with scooter, they
	are ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things. bill cox
	appears in the door.
	
	                    bill 
	          hey karl, they's somebody out here
	          to see you. some gal holding a nice
	          bouquet. 
	              (karl doesn't move)
	          come on now, she wants to talk to
	          you. don't just set there.
	
	karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by scooter.
	melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a
	cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. nobody
	says anything for a moment.
	
	                    melinda 
	          hi, karl, i'm on lunch break. these
	          was on sale 'cause they're not
	          fresh. two ninety-nine a bunch plus
	          my ten percent employee discount.
	          since i didn't bring you anything
	          to our date last night, i thought
	          you'd like to have 'em.
	
	she hands them to him.
	
	                    karl 
	          thank ye.
	
	                    bill 
	          scooter, let's me and you go over
	          to dairy queen and pick up a few
	          things for lunchtime.
	
	                    scooter
	          i can go. you don't have to. you
	          don't never go.
	
	                    bill 
	          goddamnit, scooter, come on. pardon
	          my language, ma'am.
	
	they start to leave. at the door, bill cox turns and winks at
	karl. they exit leaving karl and melinda staring at the
	counter. they are silent for a while.
	
	                    melinda 
	          well, i just thought i'd give you
	          them. i liked walkin' with you. i
	          got a blister the size of a quarter
	          on one heel. well, i'll see you
	          sometime, i guess.
	
	she walks to the door and stops as if she expects karl to say
	something.
	
	                    karl 
	          a blister shore can hurt.
	
	                    melinda 
	          yeah.
	
	                    karl
	          flowers is pretty. i've always
	          thought that.
	
	                    melinda 
	          me, too.
	
	she leaves and karl goes to the window holding the flowers
	and watches her walk away.
