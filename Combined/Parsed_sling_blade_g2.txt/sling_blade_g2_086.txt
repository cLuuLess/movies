	int. living room - night
	
	doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching tv. he looks
	up as karl comes around and sits on the sofa.
	
	                    doyle 
	          where's ever'body else? you seen
	          'em? 
	              (no response)
	          i thought i told you to get the
	          hell moved out of here anyway.
	
	                    karl 
	          how does a feller go about gettin'
	          ahold of the police?
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          pick up the fuckin' phone and call
	          'em, i guess.
	
	                    karl 
	          what numbers do you punch?
	
	                    doyle 
	          i told you to get away from here,
	          didn't i? i'm tryin' to relax and
	          look at tv. 
	              (notices blade)
	          what are you doin' with that piece
	          of iron? i swear to god you're the
	          weirdest son of a bitch i ever
	          heard of.
	
	                    karl 
	          i aim to kill you with it.
	
	doyle keeps drinking and watching tv.
	
	                    doyle 
	          yeah, okay. well, to get the police
	          you push 911. you'll need to tell
	          'em to send an ambulance, too. or a
	          hearse. you fuckin' idiot. you're
	          gonna kill me. 
	              (laughs)
	
	karl gets up and walks slowly toward doyle out of frame. we
	see the flickering light of the tv on the wall. o.s. we hear
	one short dull thud.
	
	                    doyle (o.s.) 
	          oh god! oh god!
	
	we hear one more thud, then the sound of doyle's body hitting
	the floor. karl appears in frame again and we follow him to
	the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. he stares at it
	for a moment, then pushes 911. he has a few specks of blood
	on his face, hand and shirt.
	
	                    karl 
	              (into phone)
	          yes ma'am. i need the police over
	          here at the wheatley house. 
	              (pause)
	          i've killed somebody with a mower
	          blade. 
	              (pause)
	          yes ma'am, i'm right sure of it. i
	          hit him two good whacks. that
	          second time just plumb near cut his
	          head in two. 
	              (pause)
	          hits a little old yeller house
	          right on the corner of marigold
	          street and some other street.
	          they's a red pickup truck out front
	          says doyle hargraves construction
	          on it. i'll be a settin' here
	          waitin' on ye. beside sendin' the
	          police, doyle said you might want
	          to send a ambulance or a hearse.
	          thank ye.
	
	he hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar
	of mustard. he gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the
	kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering
	up some leftovers. he picks up a biscuit and opens the
	mustard jar and runs the knife around it.
	there's hardly any mustard in it. he dabs a little on the
	biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.
	
	                                        cut to:
	
	close up of charles the nut case
	
	he's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. we pull
	back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital
	again with karl in his usual chair listening to charles. karl
	is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.
	
	                    charles 
	          ... on the third day i washed her.
	          she wasn't very clean. i got all
	          the right spots. she was the first
	          one i ever kept for any length of
	          time, you see i get bored easily, i
	          have a short attention span. i
	          can't say she enjoyed her stay,
	          although the washcloth in her mouth
	          held in place by good duct tape
	          kept any complaints to a minimum. i
	          don't really like people who talk a
	          lot. i like to do the talking. i
	          guess that's why i'm so fond of
	          you. you're so easygoing, although
	          i do sense a little tension in you
	          sometimes. by the way, how was it
	          out there? did you have any fun?
	          make any new acquaintances? tell me
	          what it was like.
	
	                    karl 
	          they was a boy. we made friends.
	
	                    charles 
	          i bet you did. i was never bent
	          that way. i'm bent the other way.
	          so, you liked it out there in the
	          world.
	
	                    karl 
	          it's too big.
	
	                    charles 
	          well, it's not too big in here, is
	          it? 
	              (pause)
	          i feel very generous today. i feel
	          like listening. i'm sure you have
	          plenty to tell me. and please bore
	          me with the details. 
	              (long pause) )
	          come on karl, who did you kill? was
	          it the boy?
	
	                    karl 
	          don't say nothin' about that boy.
	
	karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.
	
	                    karl
	          fact the bidness, don't you say
	          another word to me. i ain't
	          listenin' to you no more.
	
	karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the
	grass that separates him from the next building. he stares
	out the window, as we:
	
	                                        fade out.
