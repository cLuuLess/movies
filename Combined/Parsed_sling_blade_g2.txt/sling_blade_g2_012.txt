	int. classroom - day
	
	it's just woolridge and the two women in the room.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          well, it surprised the dickens out
	          of me. he said he'll talk to you.
	
	marsha smiles and looks at theresa.
	
	                    woolridge (cont'd)
	          but, here's the thing. he'll only
	          talk to you. he doesn't want you to
	          ask him anything. and you shouldn't
	          stare at him.
	
	                    marsha 
	          how am i going to conduct an
	          interview if i can't ask him any
	          questions?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          it's the best you're gonna get. i'm
	          sorry.
	
	                    marsha 
	          can i ask you a question? if he's
	          so troubled, why are you letting
	          him out? what if he does it again?
	          it happens all the time.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          he's free. his time's up. that's
	          the rules. he's been treated and
	          reevaluated. he doesn't show any
	          signs any more.
	
	                    marsha 
	          signs?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          homicidal signs. oh, we're gonna
	          change the light in here for karl.
	          i hope you can see to write.
	
	woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
	overhead lights. he opens the door and melvin brings karl in.
	in the semidarkness woolridge pushes a chair up and motions
	for marsha to sit. karl stands beside melvin motionless.
	woolridge whispers to theresa.
	
	                    woolridge (cont'd)
	          you'll have to step outside.
	
	theresa starts to protest.
	
	                    woolridge (cont'd)
	          please.
	
	karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as melvin
	ushers theresa outside into the hallway. karl sits staring at
	the floor. rubbing his palms together and breathing
	strangely, as usual. he sits silent for what seems like
	forever.
