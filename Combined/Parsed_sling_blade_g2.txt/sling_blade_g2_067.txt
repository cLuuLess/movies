	int. shed - day
	
	sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood. the shed has
	nothing but dirt for a floor. a few tall patches of grass
	shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers. a few old garden
	tools hang on the wall. in the center is a low circular spot
	in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt.
	karl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and
	walks out of the shed.
