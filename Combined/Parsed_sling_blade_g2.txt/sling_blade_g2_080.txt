	ext. vaughan's house - day
	
	karl knocks on the door. after a moment, vaughan answers in a
	pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt.
	
	                    vaughan
	          karl, what are you doing here? come
	          in.
	
	                    karl
	          i ain't a-stayin'. i need to ast
	          you fer a favor.
	
	                    vaughan
	          okay.
	
	                    karl
	          this evenin' i want you to go get
	          mizz wheatley and that frank and
	          have them stay with you tonight.
	
	                    vaughan
	          what's wrong? is everything okay?
	
	                    karl 
	          that dern doyle is in a bad way
	          again with that drinkin' and bein'
	          mean to folks. will you give me
	          your word you'll do it?
	
	                    vaughan
	          well, sure, okay. he hasn't hurt
	          them, has he?
	
	                    karl 
	          naw, not yet. 
	              (hands the bag to vaughan)
	          i want ye to give this to mizz
	          wheatley. hit ain't much, but maybe
	          there's a little somethin' to hep
	          out. hits what i've earned fixin'
	          lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill
	          cox.
	
	vaughan takes the bag.
	
	                    vaughan
	          what about you, karl? do you want
	          to stay here?
	
	                    karl 
	          i don't reckon you have to go with
	          women to be a daddy to a boy. 
	              (pause)
	          you've been real square dealin'
	          with me. the bible says two men ort
	          not lay together. but i'll bet you
	          the good lord wouldn't send nobody
	          like you to hades. some folks calls
	          it hell, i call it hades. 
	              (karl starts away)
	          that boy lives inside of his own
	          heart. hits an awful big place. you
	          take care of that boy.
	
	vaughan watches karl walk away.
