	ext. laundromat - day
	
	karl sits on a bench eating french fries. after a moment, a
	twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy comes out of the laundromat
	wrestling three or four big bags of laundry. he can't seem to
	get a plan together for carrying them all. karl gets up and
	goes over to him. the boy looks up at karl, a little startled
	by karl's strange figure looming over him.
	
	                    boy
	          these dang things are heavy. hard
	          to carry, too.
	
	                    karl
	          what you got in there, warshing?
	
	                    boy
	          yeah.
	
	                    karl
	          ain't you got no mama and daddy to
	          tend to it?
	
	                    boy
	          i got a mama, but she's at work
	          over at ben's dollar store. my
	          daddy's dead. 
	              (pause)
	          he got hit by a train.
	
	                    karl
	          how fer you going with them sacks
	          full of warsh?
	
	                    boy
	          about a half a mile i think it is.
	
	                    karl 
	          i'll help you tote 'em if i don't
	          give out first.
	
	                    boy
	          okay. you don't have to though.
	
	karl picks up two sacks and they walk away.
