	int. classroom - day
	
	woolridge is opening a door. he enters and the women follow
	him in. he flips on a light switch and very bright florescent
	lights illuminate the room.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          you see, karl, growing up, only
	          knew that sex was wrong and that
	          people who did it should be killed
	          for it. he couldn't really read
	          but, well, neither could his
	          mother. but, his father made sure
	          that his mother knew what the bible
	          said. and she made sure karl knew.
	          you know he slept in a hole in the
	          ground under a toolshed, right?
	
	                    marsha 
	          i knew he slept in a toolshed.
	
	                    woolridge
	          his mother told him that he was
	          their punishment. hers and his
	          father's; from god, for having sex--
	
	                    marsha 
	          before they were married?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          i don't think so. just period, i
	          think. she told him... god gave
	          them the ugliest creation he could
	          think of. karl has an entire book --
	          a notebook. on every page it says
	          "franklin chapter 1 verse number
	          1." he wrote that a few years ago
	          after he'd learned to write. his
	          father's name was franklin.
	
	                    marsha 
	          that's really strange. what does it
	          mean?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          one of his daddy's bible lessons i
	          imagine. y'all pull up a chair.
	          i'll go out and talk to him.
