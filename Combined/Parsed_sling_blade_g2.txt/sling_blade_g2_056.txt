	ext. secret place - night
	
	karl and frank sit in the clearing, karl on the stump, frank
	on the ground. frank is shining the flashlight on the book.
	he finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight.
	
	                    frank
	          i'm gettin' tired of readin' for a
	          while.
	
	                    karl
	          all right then.
	
	                    frank
	          boy, folks sure had it rough back a
	          long time ago, didn't they?
	
	                    karl
	          yeah, i reckon they did. hit like
	          to tore me up when i read about
	          that pore little cripple boy.
	
	                    frank
	          yeah, me too. 
	              (pause)
	          that was nice of that woman to give
	          you them flowers.
	
	                    karl
	          hit was right thoughty of her.
	
	                    frank
	          i was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
	
	                    karl 
	          all right then.
	
	                    frank
	          you know that girl i told you
	          about. the one i love.
	
	                    karl
	          yeah, i recollect it.
	
	                    frank
	          would you go see her with me? i
	          kind of thought i might take her
	          some flowers like that woman done
	          you.
	
	                    karl
	          if you want me to.
	
	                    frank 
	          i ain't got no money to get 'em
	          with but i bet vaughan will let me
	          have some of them flowers at the
	          store.
	
	                    karl 
	          i bet he will. i got a little money
	          if he don't. i'll get 'em for ye.
	
	                    frank 
	          i usually get run off by her mama
	          or daddy if they're home. reckon
	          why they don't like me?
	
	                    karl 
	          they ort to. you're a good boy.
	
	                    frank 
	          just 'cause i'm not rich don't mean
	          i don't love her.
	
	                    karl 
	          naw.
	
	                    frank 
	          and i don't try to touch her. you
	          know, in a bad way. foolin' around,
	          sex and all.
	
	                    karl 
	          that's real good. you ort not to if
	          ye ain't married to somebody. bible
	          tells you that much. hit tells some
	          things that don't seem right too, i
	          reckon. i guess a feller ort to
	          foller it close as he can, though. 
	              (pause)
	          you don't touch yourself, do you?
	
	                    frank 
	          what do you mean?
	
	                    karl
	          pull on your works. your privates.
	
	                    frank 
	          oh, jackin' off?
	
	                    karl 
	          yes sir. you ort not know that
	          language.
	
	                    frank 
	          i didn't know till here while back
	          a year or two ago when i spent the
	          night with ronnie smart one time.
	          he said just tug on your peter and
	          think about your mama. i tried it,
	          but i felt funny thinkin' about my
	          mama. so, i switched over to
	          thinkin' about his mama and then
	          what he told me would happen,
	          happened. it sure tingles, don't
	          it?
	
	                    karl 
	          you ort not to pull on yourself
	          that away.
	
	                    frank 
	          i kind of like you tellin' me what
	          to do and not to do. just like my
	          daddy. i didn't mind him tellin'
	          me. i hate doyle to tell me what to
	          do. mama said the only way to ever
	          get away from him is for him to get
	          away from us. that we can't leave
	          him or he'll try and hurt her.
	
	                    karl 
	          he ain't no count.
	
	                    frank 
	          you don't seem like a daddy. you
	          seem like a brother. 
	              (pause)
	          wonder what makes you like somebody
	          right off when you don't even know
	          'em like what happened with me and
	          you.
	
	                    karl 
	          i don't reckon i know.
	
	                    frank 
	          and then some people you don't like
	          right off. it's funny. 
	              (pause)
	          you know why i want you to play
	          ball with me?
	
	                    karl 
	          naw.
	
	                    frank 
	          'cause it's fun. it don't matter if
	          you ain't no good. it takes your
	          mind off of everything else while
	          you're doin' it. when you run real
	          fast tryin' to make a touchdown you
	          don't think about anything else. i
	          ain't no good, but my daddy always
	          said he was proud of me when i
	          threw a ball or ran with it. did
	          you have any brothers and sisters
	          growin' up to play with?
	
	                    karl
	          i had one there for little bit. hit
	          didn't get old enough to play with.
	
	                    frank
	          why not? it died?
	
	                    karl
	          yeah.
	
	                    frank
	          why?
	
	                    karl
	          hit was borned a little too early
	          on. my mother and father made hit
	          come too early some way or other. i
	          reckon they changed their mind
	          about havin' another'n. i was about
	          six or eight year old then and they
	          didn't care too much for me so i
	          reckon they didn't need somethin'
	          else to worry 'em with.
	
	                    frank
	          so it died when it come out?
	
	                    karl
	          my daddy come to the shed out back
	          and got me and said throw this here
	          away and handed me a towel with
	          somethin' in it. i went for the
	          trash barrel there and opened up
	          the towel to see 'cause they was a
	          noise and somethin' movin' in it.
	          hit was bloody-like around that
	          towel. hit was a little ol' bitty
	          baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
	
	                    frank 
	          it was alive?
	
	                    karl 
	          yes sir. right then it was.
	
	                    frank 
	          a boy or girl?
	
	                    karl 
	          a little ol' boy.
	
	                    frank 
	          you threw it in a trash barrel?
	
	                    karl 
	          i didn't feel right about doin'
	          that. i takened a shoe box from
	          there in the shed and emptied out
	          some screwdrivers and nuts and
	          warshers from it and put the little
	          feller in that and buried him in
	          the corner of the yard there. that
	          seemed more proper to me, i reckon.
	
	                    frank 
	          it was still alive when you buried
	          it?
	
	                    karl 
	          i heared it cryin' a little through
	          that box.
	
	                    frank 
	          that don't seem right. it seems
	          like you should have kept him alive
	          and took care of him if he was your
	          brother.
	
	                    karl 
	          i wadn't but six or eight. i reckon
	          i didn't know what to do. i didn't
	          know how to care for no baby. mama
	          and daddy didn't want him. they
	          learned me to do what they told me
	          to. these days i figure it might of
	          been best to give him right back to
	          the good lord right off the bat
	          anyhow.
	
	                    frank 
	          that makes me feel real sad.
	          couldn't you have done somethin',
	          karl? i would have. i wish i would
	          of had him. he'd be here right now.
	          livin'.
	
	                    karl 
	          hits been hard thinkin' about it.
	          they ain't a day goes by i don't
	          think about it. i kindly have a
	          picture of it up in my head that i
	          see. hit makes me sad, too. i have
	          bad thoughts on it. i wished they
	          was somethin' i could of did, too.
	          shouldn't no bad things happen to
	          childern. all the ol' bad things
	          ort to be saved up for folks that's
	          growed up, the way i see it. i
	          shouldn't of told you about that. a
	          boy ort not hear about such things.
	          it just kindly come out.
	
	                    frank 
	          i didn't mean to say anything bad
	          about you. i know you're good. you
	          didn't mean no harm. 
	              (pause)
	          did you ever think about killin'
	          yourself on purpose like my daddy
	          did?
	
	                    karl 
	          i've studied about it. the bible
	          says not to or you end up goin' to
	          hades. some folks calls it hell, i
	          call it hades.
	
	                    frank 
	          bible says the same thing about
	          killin' others, too.
	
	                    karl 
	          yes sir, i reckon it does.
