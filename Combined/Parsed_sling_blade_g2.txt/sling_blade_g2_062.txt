	int. wheatley garage - day
	
	karl is on his cot reading a book. frank comes in. he looks
	very depressed. he sits beside karl.
	
	                    frank 
	          what you readin'?
	
	                    karl 
	          readin' on this book on how to work
	          carpentry. i aim to learn how to
	          build things out of wood one of
	          these times. i've always been
	          partial to wood buildin's and
	          cabinets and whatnot. these
	          drawin's they got here don't make
	          no sense to me so far. 
	              (he looks directly at
	               frank, which he seldom
	               does)
	          you seem like yore tails a'draggin'
	          a might. you got somethin' wrong
	          with ye?
	
	                    frank 
	          seems like doyle's wormed his way
	          back in. mama said he's stayin'
	          over tonight and he's talkin' about
	          movin' in for good. we ain't ever
	          gonna be happy. we'll always be
	          nervous, won't we karl?
	
	                    karl 
	          i don't reckon i know. i ain't
	          found no way yet and i'm three or
	          four times as old as you. might be
	          that's just the way folks is.
	
	                    frank 
	          i feel sad about karen cross, too.
	          i just make like to myself she
	          loves me. i know better, though. it
	          just feels good to me when i
	          imagine it.
	
	                    karl 
	          make believin' always made me feel
	          good too from time to time.
	
	they sit in silence for a moment.
	
	                    karl (cont'd)
	          bill cox is goin' to a funeral for
	          a mister turner tomorrow and a
	          closin' up shop early.
	
	                    frank 
	          is that right?
	
	                    karl 
	          i'll play ball with ye. i reckon if
	          neither one of us is no count it
	          won't make no difference.
	
	                    frank 
	          you will? for sure?
	
	                    karl 
	          yeah.
	
	                    frank 
	          we'll be on teams, me and you?
	
	                    karl 
	          yessir.
