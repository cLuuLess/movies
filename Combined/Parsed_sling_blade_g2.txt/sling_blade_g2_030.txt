	int. shop workroom - night
	
	the place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed-eaters, and
	other equipment, most of it in pieces. a small cot is in a
	little clearing in the corner by the bathroom. karl is
	sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while scooter
	puts some tools away. bill comes to the door.
	
	                    bill
	          all right then, i'll see y'all
	          later. karl you done a good day's
	          work. they right about you.
	          scooter, he's gonna knock you out
	          of a job if you're not careful.
	          i'll see you tomorrow.
	
	                    scooter 
	          wait up, i'll leave with you and
	          lock up.
	
	                    bill 
	          karl, they's a blanket up in under
	          that cot and soap in the bathroom
	          to clean up with. 
	              (pause)
	          now there's one more thing. the way
	          we lock these doors at night, you
	          can't get out. you didn't want to
	          go anywhere, did you?
	
	                    karl 
	          i don't reckon.
	
	                    bill 
	          if it works out and all, maybe
	          we'll get you a key so you can get
	          out at night if you need to. see
	          you later.
	
	they leave karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. he
	sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. after a
	moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.
