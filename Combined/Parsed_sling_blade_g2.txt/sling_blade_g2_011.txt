	outside the door of the classroom. they reach him and
	woolridge talks quietly to karl.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          karl, you know, do you remember
	          when i told you about those people
	          from that newspaper? 
	              (pause)
	          they want to ask you some questions
	          about your release. they think it
	          would make an interesting story.
	          will you talk to 'em? get
	          interviewed. 
	              (pause)

	          might be good for you to. you're
	          gonna be seein' all kinds of people
	          when you go on the outside. this'll
	          help you i believe.
