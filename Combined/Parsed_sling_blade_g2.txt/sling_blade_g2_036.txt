	int. wheatley living room - night
	
	doyle is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle
	drinking beer. he's in his late thirties and dressed in his
	construction clothes. linda sits on the arm of the chair and
	frank stands before them.
	
	                    doyle 
	          well, honey, i don't guess i give a
	          shit. i ain't here half the time
	          anyway. if you want a retard livin'
	          in the garage, i don't guess i
	          care. i've got a good tool box and
	          socket set out there i don't want
	          stol'd. i guess i could take it
	          home with me.
	
	                    frank
	          he's real honest. he wouldn't steal
	          nothin'.
	
	                    doyle 
	          now son, i wadn't talkin' to you,
	          was i? 
	              (pause)
	          was i?
	
	                    frank 
	          no sir.
	
	                    doyle 
	          no sir's right. i'm talkin' to your
	          mama. this is your mama's decision,
	          not yours. i'm lettin' it go on
	          because she asked me, not you. 
	              (to linda)
	          now is this the kind of retard that
	          drools and rubs shit in his hair
	          and all that, 'cause i have trouble
	          eatin' around that kind of thing.
	          just like i am about antique
	          furniture and midgets. i can't so
	          much as drink a glass of water
	          around a midget or a piece of
	          antique furniture. same thing with
	          a droolin' retard.
	
	                    linda
	          doyle, you're awful. you shouldn't
	          be that way.
	
	                    doyle 
	          i ain't sayin' it's right. i'm just
	          tellin' the truth. what was he in
	          the nuthouse for?
	
	                    linda 
	          he's just mentally retarded, i
	          guess.
	
	                    doyle 
	          he had of went nuts and did
	          somethin'. they don't put you in
	          there for just bein' a retard.
	          they's retards all over the place
	          that ain't in the nuthouse. do you
	          know, frank?
	
	                    frank 
	          i ain't sure.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you might want to find out. he
	          might of hacked his family to
	          pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
	
	                    linda 
	          yeah, that's right, frank, you
	          better ask him. i mean, don't hurt
	          his feelin's or anything, but it
	          would be good to know. i'm sure
	          it's nothin'. he seems real sweet.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you sure are hung up on people
	          bein' sweet. 
	              (takes a long pull on his
	               beer)
	          speakin' of which, where's your
	          girlfriend? i thought he was comin'
	          by here for something.
	
	                    linda 
	          he'll be here in a little while,
	          he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
	
	                    doyle 
	          ain't that the sweetest thing. what
	          am i supposed to do about supper
	          with you traipsin' around with that
	          fag?
	
	                    linda 
	          you're not crippled. get in there
	          and make somethin'.
	
	                    doyle 
	          boy, ain't you somethin' else.
	          talkin' back and everything. it
	          kinda makes me horny when you talk
	          back.
	
	                    linda 
	          frank, why don't you go off and
	          play in your room if doyle's gonna
	          talk nasty.
	
	                    frank 
	          i want to watch t.v.
	
	                    doyle 
	          yeah, honey, let the kid watch t.v.
	          hell, let's all watch t.v. like a
	          family till your retarded friend
	          and your homosexual friend gets
	          here.
