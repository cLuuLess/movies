	int. living room - day
	
	karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an old
	man in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap.
	karl stands facing him for several moments.
	
	                    karl 
	          i'm ye boy.
	
	                    old man 
	          i ain't got no boy.
	
	                    karl 
	          i'm ye oldest boy name karl.
	
	                    old man 
	          i ain't got no boy.
	
	                    karl 
	          they turned me aloose from the
	          nervous hospital. said i was well.
	
	no response.
	
	                    karl (cont'd)
	          i got hired to work for a mr. cox
	          fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.
	
	no response.
	
	                    karl (cont'd)
	          that grass out in the yard's all
	          growed up. i figured i might cut it
	          fer ye.
	
	                    old man 
	          i told you, i ain't got no boy, now
	          get on out from here and let me be.
	
	long silence.
	
	                    karl 
	          i learned to read some. i've read
	          on the bible quite a bit. i don't
	          understand all of it, but i believe
	          i understand a good deal of it.
	          them stories mama and you told me
	          ain't in there. you ort not to of
	          done that to ye boy. 
	              (pause)
	          i've studied on killin' you. but i
	          don't reckon they's no reason fer
	          it if all you're gonna do is set
	          there in that chair. you'll be dead
	          soon enough i reckon and the
	          world'll be shut of ye. 
	              (karl walks toward the
	               kitchen and turns back to
	               the old man)
	          you ort not to of killed my
	          brother. he ort to have had a
	          chance to grow up. sometimes he
	          would of had fun.
