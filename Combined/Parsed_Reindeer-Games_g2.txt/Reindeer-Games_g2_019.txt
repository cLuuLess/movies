               int. motel room - day - later

               the bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. rudy and ashley 
               rest naked amidst them. her pretty young head on his chest, 
               all their inhibitions gone. rudy strokes her arms.

                                     rudy
                         tell me something. this the first 
                         time you've ever done this?

                                     ashley
                         go to hell, nick mason, what's that 
                         supposed to mean --

                                     rudy
                         no, not that, no...
                              (laughs, kisses her)
                         i mean this, the whole thing. start 
                         writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. 
                         get a boyfriend like this. tell me 
                         the truth.

                                     ashley
                         well. you're not the first guy i 
                         wrote to. but you're the only one i 
                         kept writing to.

                                     rudy
                         yeah. me too.
                              (considers)
                         why? i mean i know why for me, why i 
                         paid for the ad. but you... why start 
                         writing to some guy -- some con -- 
                         you don't even know?

               ashley studies his face, smiles in reflection.

                                     ashley
                         i told you, nick. remember?

                                     rudy
                         tell me again.

                                     ashley
                         all the guys i've ever been with... 
                         they never want to know me. who i am 
                         on the inside. they just want to qet 
                         inside. when they do, they think 
                         that means they know who i am. that 
                         i trust them. that they know me. 
                         that there's nothing left to learn.
                              (beat)
                         a guy like you, nick -- six months 
                         before you can even touch my face. i 
                         figure a guy in that kind of bind, 
                         he's gonna hafta work to get to know 
                         me some other way.

                                     rudy
                         had some bad relationships, didn't 
                         you.

                                     ashley
                         not bad. just regular.
                              (smiles)
                         you wrote me wonderful things, nick.  
                         personal things.

               she turns to him, kisses his chest --

                                     rudy
                         well, wasn't all me, y'know.

                                     ashley
                         yes it was all you --

                                     rudy
                         guy i was in with... he helped 
                         sometimes... some of the romantic 
                         stuff, actually... you'd like him --

                                     ashley
                         i'm talking about the heart, nick. 
                         i'm not talking about the words.

                                     rudy
                         y'know, some of the heart mighta 
                         been his too...

                                     ashley
                         then he shoulda signed his name.

               she turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. ready 
               to make up for lost time. with a kiss:

                                     ashley
                         and he'd be here right now.
