               ext. knights inn parking lot - day

               the three truckers stride to the nova, where jumpy guards 
               rudy and ashley. in the b.g., the ice fishermen are by their 
               car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces 
               overnight.

               gabriel marches straight to rudy and slugs him in the gut. 
               rudy hits the snow --

                                     ashley
                         gabriel!

                                     gabriel
                         that's for the hundred bucks worth 
                         of pay-per-view.
                              (then kicks him)
                         and that's for the two hundred you 
                         took outta your minibar.

                                     rudy
                              (chokes, pained)
                         you guys were paying for the room, i 
                         just figured --

               gabriel kicks him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at 
               rudy's head. ashley screams, rushes him --

               -- as gabriel's gun shoots a thin stream of water into rudy's 
               face.

               it's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.

                                     gabriel
                              (cruel smile)
                         you wanted a weapon, convict? you 
                         got one.

               gabriel tosses the water pistol onto rudy's chest. jumpy and 
               pug haul him up. with venom:

                                     gabriel
                         merry christmas-eve.
