               int. tomahawk

               rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar. onto 
               the floor with bear the bartender, whispering hard:

                                     rudy
                         get down and stay down, and you're 
                         gonna be fine. just don't do anything. 
                         my friends are disturbed --

               the hostages do as told. rudy breathes relief, squirt gun in 
               hand. and then stares at the array of bottles around him.

               in the cashier's cage

               merlin and pug force the cashiers to the floor:

                                     pug
                         what's the security code to the count 
                         room?

                                     cashier #1
                         security code? what security code?  
                         you just use a key!

                                     pug
                         nick said security code!

                                     cashier #1
                         who's nick?!

               pug bangs the guy's head off the floor, stalks to the count 
               room door. just a key lock. pug blows it away with his guns, 
               kicks the door open --

               -- and gets shot to hell by three count men inside, pistols 
               blazing! pug puppets, dead. a wad of chaw hits the ceiling.

               stunned merlin fires back.
