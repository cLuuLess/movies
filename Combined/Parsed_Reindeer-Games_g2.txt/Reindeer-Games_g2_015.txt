               the young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy 
               road. but it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.

               the door opens. and rudy steps out.

               the bus revs up again and groans off into the winter.

               the young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. we

                                     rudy

               ashley nods. and rudy sadly smiles.

                                     rudy
                         i'm nick.

                                                                    cut to:
