               ext. woods

               merlin, jumpy and pug keep up their steady march. rudy's 
               running figure now only fifty yards distant.

                                     merlin
                         you keep running, nick! keep running 
                         now! can't keep warm if you don't 
                         keep running! we'll just be right 
                         back here... keeping track of your 
                         trail.

               angle to show merlin's striding right in rudy's bootprints. 
               pug fires off two shots.

               they kick up snow just behind rudy, struggling, panting...

                                     merlin (o.s.)
                         wherever you run... we'll get there. 
                         fast as you want... we'll be there.  
                         we drive for a living, nick. twelve, 
                         fifteen, twenty-hour days.

               rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush 
               away his footprints. realizes it's useless.

               a bullet whistles through the pine branches.

                                     merlin (o.s.)
                         we got nothing but time.

               rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --

               -- then stops at the sound of a rumbling. getting louder. 
               closer. it's a car's engine.

               rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out 
               a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. 
               another bullet smashes treebark. rudy runs for it.
