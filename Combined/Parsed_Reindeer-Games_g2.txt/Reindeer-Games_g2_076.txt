               ext. knights inn parking lot - night

               light snow falling. rudy drops from the second floor window 
               into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. he 
               stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's blazer.

               at the fishermen's blazer

               rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and 
               gear boxes in the back seat.

               he takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and 
               slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming 
               it around until it trips the door lock.

               the lock pops up; rudy pops in --
