               int. bathroom

               as merlin crashes in, seeing the cowboy hat and jacket, back 
               turned, adjusting a belt. as the figure turns around.

               it's the college kid. merlin stops in his tracks --

               -- as rudy crashes into him from a stall, kicking his legs 
               out, driving his throat into a countertop. merlin hits the 
               ground, gagging. rudy wears the kid's sweatshirt:

                                     rudy
                         go! go!

               the college kid, shaking, hustles out the door.
