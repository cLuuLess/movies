               ext. rudy's journey - montage - night/day

               in his burnt and battered santa suit, rudy's figure trudges 
               the snowy night. two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty 
               roads and highways. and passing a roadsign that reads "sidnaw -- 
               35 miles."

               drummer boy" start to rise --

               with snow falling, he passes a new sign: "sidnaw -- 27 miles."

               with the sun rising, a pair of children huddle at a window, 
               seeing the man in the santa suit at the end of their driveway. 
               giving them something from his sack and ambling on.

               mailboxes. at every-stop on the way.
