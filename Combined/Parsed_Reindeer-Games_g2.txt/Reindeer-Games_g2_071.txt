               int. rudy's room

               ashley nestles against him. rudy stares skyward. hard.

                                     rudy
                         they'll have guns.

                                     ashley
                         what?

                                     rudy
                         you said they've run guns, in their 
                         trucks. so they'll have guns. to do 
                         this robbery. they'll have serious 
                         guns.

                                     ashley
                         i don't know...

                                     rudy
                         we'll need one.

               ashley frowns. there's a new look in rudy's eyes.

                                     rudy
                         i'm going to have to be inside that 
                         casino. when it happens. i'll need 
                         to be part of it. i can't just be 
                         drawing some map.

                                     ashley
                         nick, what are you talking about?

                                     rudy
                         we need to find a way to make me 
                         part of it.

                                     ashley
                         part of... with them?

               rudy meets her eyes.

                                     rudy
                         if we're helping them with their 
                         robbery, we're gonna be doing more 
                         than just walking away. like that's 
                         some christmas bonus.

               he nods, scheming the way he's always known.

                                     rudy
                         you want him outta your life? you 
                         want a real new year to look forward 
                         to?
                              (bravely)
                         if we're gonna do this... we're gonna 
                         do it to get it all.
