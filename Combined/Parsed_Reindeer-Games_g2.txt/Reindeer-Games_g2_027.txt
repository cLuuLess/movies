               ext. interstate - night

               as we swoop down onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, 
               arcing into the blackness.

               closing on an 18-wheel tractor trailer, rumbling onward, 
               emblazoned with "great lakes trucking." there's an airbrush 
               painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru 
               a flaming radial tire, and the legend "motor city monster."
