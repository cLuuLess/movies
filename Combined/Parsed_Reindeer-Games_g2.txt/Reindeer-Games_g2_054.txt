               ext. parking lot/int. nova

               gabriel and pug sit sentry, seeing the cowboy figure leave 
               the casino. wandering into-the parking lot... away from them.

                                     gabriel
                         where the hell's he going?

                                     pug
                         where the hell's your sister?

               as the figure unlocks the driver's door of a trans am --

                                     gabriel
                         get him!

               pug revs the engine, speeds through the lot, cutting off the 
               trans am from backing away.

               gabriel jumps out, hauls the cowboy from his car and sees 
               it's the college kid. rudy's gone.

                                     college kid
                              (scared shitless)
                         oh man. it's your jacket, isn't it...
