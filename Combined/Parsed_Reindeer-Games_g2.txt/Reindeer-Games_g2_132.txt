               ext. ravine's edge - same

               the last of the opening images. rudy's motionless santa 
               figure, upside-down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit 
               still aflame. he opens his eyes.

               angle on snowy road

               rudy staggers to his feet. battered and dazed. looks at 
               gabriel's body. then looks to the trailer.

               inside, nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist 
               down.

               he's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:

                                     nick
                         ...rudy... help me... rudy...

               rudy climbs the tire ramp. and pulls the trailer gate shut.

               he climbs into the rig's cab. starts the engine. puts the 
               truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.

                                     nick (o.s.)
                         ...rudy! rudy! help me!!!

               the truck rolls backwards. and into the ravine.

               rudy listens to its tumbling sounds all the way to the bottom. 
               he then looks up the road one way. then the other.

               and notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.

               he stares at them.

               a long time.

                                                               dissolve to:
