               int. game room - morning

               a wood-panelled room adjacent to a small indoor pool, with 
               arcade games and a dart board. gabriel's with pug, tossing 
               darts, as jumpy and a chain-smoking merlin haul rudy in.

                                     pug
                         goddamn, merlin. there any part of 
                         the day you don't smoke?

                                     merlin
                         there anytime you don't got a mouthful 
                         of shit?

                                     pug
                         cancer-sucker.

                                     merlin
                         acid-chewer.

               gabriel thwaps a dart into the board, to shut them up.

                                     gabriel
                         take a look what pug's bought for 
                         ya.

               pug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine. cowboy boots, 
               spurs, a black cowboy hat, a black rhinestone jacket and a 
               longhaired wig tumbles out.

                                     rudy
                         a cowboy. you're going to send me 
                         into an indian casino disguised as a 
                         cowboy. have you thought this entirely 
                         through?

                                     gabriel
                         put it on.

               merlin and jumpy shove rudy toward the merchandise. gabriel 
               slams another dart into the board, then turns:

                                     gabriel
                         you're a country-western singer up 
                         from nashville for the the holidays. 
                         visiting your grandma on the lake, 
                         driving into the tomahawk for some 
                         scotch and slots. you only play the 
                         slots, you got that? don't want no 
                         dealer friend of yours recognizing 
                         you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.

                                     rudy
                         what kind of half-ass cowboy plays 
                         the slots?

                                     gabriel
                         you do.

                                     rudy
                         at least gimme video poker.

                                     gabriel
                         shut the fuck up. you play what your 
                         girlfriend plays. ashley's going in 
                         with you. you talk to her, otherwise 
                         you don't talk to nobody. you walk 
                         the room as many times as you want, 
                         but the second you come out, i want 
                         to know the run of the place.

               rudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear.

                                     rudy
                         do i get a country-western name?

                                     gabriel
                         you get recognized, convict, you get 
                         a country-western funeral.
