               ext. snow-filled ravine - night

               where the fifth and final santa lies at the edge of a ravine, 
               which plummets a hundred feet down. the man rests precariously 
               atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.

               his burned suit is smoldering. he has a sly but tired face, 
               late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. this is rudy duncan.

               he opens his eyes.

                                     rudy (v.o.)
                         i never was much for the holidays.

                                                              cut to black:

               the sound of a winter wind

               rises, as a title appears: "seven days before..."

               and then, to complete the sentence: "...xmas."

               fade in:
