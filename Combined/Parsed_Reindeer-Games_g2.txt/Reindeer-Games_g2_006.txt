               int. prison cell - day

               rudy duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- 
               where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.

               the sounds of yelling inmates and gates slamming shut echo 
               through the fortress. rudy watches a spider scurry across 
               the paper snow. it's his excitement for the day.

               he turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage 
               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. and a family 
               photo, cheery midwesterners, with rudy a scowling artful 
               dodger.

               a wall calendar

               shows the dates have been crossed off up to december 18th.

               december 22nd is circled again and again.

               rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. drops 
               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. 
               turning back to the beds we reveal --

               the lower bunk

               where rudy's cellmate, nick mason (32), rugged, mustached 
               and well-built, sleeps soundly. in contrast, his bed-wall is 
               a collage of photographs, twenty, maybe thirty of them. almost 
               a mural.

               all of them photos of a beautiful young girl, mid-twenties, 
               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. gorgeous 
               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. effortlessly sexy.

               rudy

               stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. nick snores, 
               turns over. rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen 
               this time. and crosses december 18th off the calendar.

                                                                    cut to:
