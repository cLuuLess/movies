               int. supermarket - day

               close on conveyor

               as bottles of wine, vodka and rum, cartons of egg nog and 
               orange juice, and countless prepackaged sandwiches come 
               scrolling past.

                                     ashley (o.s.)
                         you know what i was thinking, after 
                         our holiday hideaway? instead of 
                         going back to detroit, maybe we could 
                         go gambling. y'know? drive up to 
                         that indian place you worked at. 
                         wouldn't that be fun? i haven't gone 
                         gambling in forever!
