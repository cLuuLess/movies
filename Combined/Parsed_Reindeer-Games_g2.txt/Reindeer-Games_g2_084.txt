               ext. parking lot

               rudy jumps from the blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, 
               the woods. his own footprints in the dusting snow.

                                     rudy
                         how far you gonna get, rudy...

               realizing the answer, rudy looks to his room's window. forced 
               to race back. he tries clambering the wall, standing an 
               shrubbery, but he can't reach. he whirls, desperate.

               and his eyes find the blazer.
