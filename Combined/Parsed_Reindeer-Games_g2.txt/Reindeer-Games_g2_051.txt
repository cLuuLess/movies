               merlin's at a slot machine, watching the hall to the 
               bathrooms. a waitress arrives, hands him a beer:

                                     merlin

                         five years. since it opened.

                                     merlin
                         how long ago was your makeover?

                         no, the place. the remodeling. moving 
                         everything around.

               the waitress frowns.

                                     waitress
                         the tomahawk's looked the same since 
                         i started, mister.
                              (shrugs)
                         only the losers change.

               merlin stares at her. then drops his drink to the floor, 
               charging for the bathroom.
