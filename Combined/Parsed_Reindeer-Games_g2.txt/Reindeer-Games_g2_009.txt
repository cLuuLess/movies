               int. main prison floor - day

               guards monitor prisoners as they file out of their cells for 
               the afternoon meal. rudy and nick are motioned out by a mean 
               guard, his bitter world etched in his face. they join the 
               line.

                                     rudy
                         shit. alamo's back.

               across broadway, a parallel line is forming. a tall, tattooed 
               native american, the alamo, steps out of his cell. his hands 
               are the size of a man's skull.

                                     nick
                         don't look like he missed the 
                         sunlight.

                                     rudy
                         pinscher told me alamo thinks i'm 
                         the one ratted on him beating up 
                         cree. since i was there, i saw it, 
                         he thinks i got him sent to solitary.

                                     nick
                         aw, rudy.

               at that moment, alamo glances over. finds rudy's eyes. rudy 
               swiftly looks away --

                                     rudy
                         count me outta mealtime --

               he slaps nick an the back, heads back for their cell --

                                     mean guard
                         get back in line!

                                     rudy
                         i'm not hungry, i'm gonna --

                                     mean guard
                         shoulda stayed in your hole! get 
                         back in fucking line!

               the mean guard pulls his blackjack. another guard's ready 
               behind him. they want rudy to give them trouble.

               rudy stops. slides back into the line of prisoners. looks 
               across broadway. the alamo's walked on up ahead. rudy 
               swallows, heads toward the mess hall.
