               ext. supermarket parking lot - dusk

               light snow falls. rudy, in his new black fringe eyesore, and 
               ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt:

                                     rudy
                         well, i don't know about that --

                                     ashley
                         blackjack, nick, blackjack i am good 
                         at. i mean, they'd give us some free 
                         games or something, wouldn't they? 
                         since you worked there?

                                     rudy
                         security, ash, i just worked security.  
                         they wouldn't be rolling out the red 
                         carpet --

                                     ashley
                         and the slots, slots i'm good at 
                         too. wouldn't that be fun?

                                     rudy
                         we'll have more fun in detroit.

                                     ashley
                         we could live it up and --

                                     rudy
                         ashley. we're not going anywhere i 
                         used to work.

               it comes out too harsh. ashley stops, a little hurt.

                                     ashley
                         i just... i thought you'd have friends 
                         there...

               rudy softens, touches her arms:

                                     rudy
                         hey. i been in prison for two years, 
                         ash. believe me. those guys wouldn't 
                         want to see me.

               he kisses her. she nods, dismisses it, kisses back.

                                     ashley
                         well, they don't know what the hell 
                         they're missing.
