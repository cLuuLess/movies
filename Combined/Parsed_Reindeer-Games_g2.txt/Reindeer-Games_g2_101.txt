               int. gabriel's rig

               gabriel hands copies of rudy's sketched map to merlin and 
               jumpy.

               rudy and ashley are in the sleeper.

                                     gabriel
                         commit this thing to memory. every 
                         guard, every exit... don't tape it 
                         to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. 
                         that's the gospel right there. the 
                         gospel. matthew, mark, luke and 
                         john...

               rudy watches them studying his made-up map. ashley strokes 
               his arm, gives a loving smile. rudy stares at her.

               he smiles right back.
