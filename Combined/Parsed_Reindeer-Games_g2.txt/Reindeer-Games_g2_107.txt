               int. security level

               a ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level 
               through smoked glass. desks, file cabinets, pin-up 
               centerfolds. a room with video monitors to one side. stairs 
               to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.

               jack bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. he opens a 
               battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the 
               bottle for himself. walks over to his head of security, 
               watching the lack of activity below:

                                     jack bangs
                         and all through the house... not a 
                         creature was stirring...
                              (sighs)
                         why don't you go ahead and send most 
                         of your guys home, ed.

                                     security boss
                         thanks, jack. merry x-mas.

               the boss smiles, heads off. jack bangs swigs his brandy, 
               eyes his high-tech security gear glumly:

                                     jack bangs
                         hell. nobody even comes here to 
                         cheat...
