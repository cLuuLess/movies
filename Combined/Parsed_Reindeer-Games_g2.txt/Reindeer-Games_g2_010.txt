               int. mess hall - day

               a gloopy spoon of chunky red and green jello gets splooshed 
               on rudy's plate. same with nick. it's the cafeteria line.

                                     nick
                         what the fuck is this?

                                     ugly staffer
                         holiday jello.

                                     nick
                         what's this shit in it?

                                     ugly staffer
                         swallow and see.

               the ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. nick 
               looks to rudy, then turns back to the help:

                                     nick
                         just so you know, this man and i are 
                         outta here in two days. so while 
                         we're inhaling london broil and 
                         lobster bisque, you're gonna still 
                         be standing here smelling up the 
                         mystery creamfuck.
                              (nods)
                         who's in prison now?

               the ugly staffer curls his lip. nick smiles. rudy moves on, 
               taking his tray off the rail and turning --

               -- right into the chest of the alamo. he looks up -- into 
               the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to 
               see. the alamo's a lifer. many times over.

                                     the alamo
                         when you don't expect it.

                                     rudy
                         it wasn't me, alamo --

                                     the alamo
                         that's when.

               the alamo strides into the cafeteria line. rudy finally takes 
               a breath, as if he's dodged death. nick's at his shoulder. 
               they share a grave and worried look. trying to help:

                                     nick
                         two days.
