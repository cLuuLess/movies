               int. gabriel's rig - cab - night

               gabriel drives, with ashley beside him. rudy sits in the 
               sleeper, jumpy sitting guard.

               out the window

               they pass a brightly neon-lit building, with a parking lot 
               full of cars. the tomahawk casino, with a red neon axe 
               pointing the way.

               and a marquee which reads: "10x odds on craps. $5.95 prime 
               rib. performing tonight: dakota!"

               the truck motors on by. gabriel nods to rudy:

                                     gabriel
                         bring back some memories, nick?

                                     rudy
                         more than you know.
