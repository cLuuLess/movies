               int. tomahawk - day

               rudy and ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket 
               of quarters. rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two 
               security guards punch a code in a private door, step inside:

                                     ashley
                         so does it look a lot different?

                                     rudy
                         here and there. restaurant, uh, that's 
                         the main expansion. tables've been 
                         moved around; the big man's office, 
                         i dunno, might be upstairs now.

               they settle at a slot machine. another security guard walks 
               past them. rudy turns his back. ashley notices.

                                     ashley
                         that guy knows you?

                                     rudy
                         yeah, uh. mike. that's mike.

               at the door, merlin and jumpy enter, wandering through the 
               slots.

               rudy sees them.

                                     rudy
                         you start spending your brother's 
                         money. i'm gonna take a circuit around 
                         the joint, check for any new ins and 
                         outs. i'll snag us some drinks.

               as he strides away --

                                     ashley
                              (sotto)
                         be careful, nick...

               moving through the casino

               with rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking 
               out the layout. in reality, he's surveying the gamblers.

               passing the cage, he walks right by jack bangs and the indian 
               governors. jack bangs is all smiles, while the governors 
               turn their backs an him and storm out.

               arriving at the bar

                                     rudy
                         couple rum and cokes, please.

                                     indian bartender
                         you want that rum and coke or rum 
                         and pepsi?

               rudy gives him a strange look. the bartender shrugs. rudy 
               still scans the tables, settling on --

               a blackjack table

               where a trio of college kids are forking over chips. one of 
               them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. 
               rudy studies this kid for moment.

                                     jack bangs (o.s.)
                         gimme a goddamn bottle of anything.

               back at the bar

               jack bangs sidles up, distraught. the barkeep hands him a 
               bottle. bangs takes a swig.

                                     jack bangs
                         i can't go back to vegas, bear. 
                         they'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? i 
                         can't go back...

                                     bartender
                         what does the tribe want?

                                     jack bangs
                         they want gold-paved roads is what 
                         they want. talking 'bout the fuckin' 
                         paiutes. fuckin' paiutes are on the 
                         interstate. nothing i can do about 
                         that, man, i didn't pick the spot 
                         for your reservation.

                                     bartender
                         neither did we.

                                     jack bangs
                         yeah, yeah, whatever.

               rudy gets his drinks, as jack bangs turns his way:

                                     jack bangs
                         hey. hey, cowboy. jack bangs, i run 
                         the place. nice to have you in the 
                         tomahawk. tell me something...

               rudy winces, glancing to see merlin and jumpy watching him. 
               frowns on their faces.

                                     jack bangs
                         ...does upstate michigan need another 
                         roadside casino or does upstate 
                         michigan need an international gaming 
                         destination?

                                     rudy
                              (wants outta here)
                         roadside casino?

               jack bangs, smile falls flat.

                                     jack bangs
                         well, so how'd you hear about this 
                         place, then. word-of-mouth? mass 
                         mailings? cable tv?

                                     rudy
                         prison.

                                     jack bangs
                         prison?!

               rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. bangs looks 
               sick, turns to a fat guy on the next stool over. but before 
               he can ask, the guy shakes his head --

                                     fat guy
                         i just stopped in to use the can.

               bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands:

                                     jack bangs
                         i can't go back to vegas, bear... i 
                         can't...

               from the slots, we hear a jackpot payoff.

                                     jack bangs
                         aw fuck.

               through the tables

               walks rudy, as merlin sidles up next to him:

                                     merlin
                         what the hell was that about --

                                     rudy
                         he didn't recognize me. back off, 
                         willya? he didn't recognize me.

               merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. 
               as he nears ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where 
               the college kid has left... heading for the bathroom --

                                     ashley
                         hey nick! we're up fifty cents!

               -- and as a barely-dressed cocktail waitress crosses between 
               rudy and ashley, blocking her view of him --

               rudy pretends to crash into her, splashing the rum and coke 
               into his own face --

                                     rudy
                         heyyyy!

               reaching ashley, his goatee is dripping --

                                     ashley
                         nick, what happened --

                                     rudy
                         there went my... damn... well, doesn't 
                         seem like security's all that 
                         switched... ash, shit, this mustache 
                         is starting to fall off. i gotta fix 
                         this thing --
                              (hands her his glass)
                         -- drink this for me.

               he hustles for the bathroom. a moment later, jumpy storms 
               by.

               stops at ashley.

                                     jumpy
                         what happened?

                                     ashley
                         he started losing his hair.
