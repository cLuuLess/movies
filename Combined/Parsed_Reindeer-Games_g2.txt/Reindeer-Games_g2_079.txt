               int. halllway to indoor pool - night

               rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads 
               "pool closed. open 9 am to 9 pm, no lifeguard on duty."

               rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. the 
               small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. from an 
               unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --

               it's ashley. hair wet, naked beneath the surface. smiling 
               and splashing someone offscreen --

                                     ashley
                         ...and he's saying "we're not gonna 
                         help him just to walk away. if we're 
                         gonna help him... we're gonna get it 
                         all...

               she splashes again. taunting --

                                     ashley
                         ...he wants to help now, he wants to 
                         rob it now we could probably stay 
                         right here, he'd go on and rob it by 
                         himself --

               as gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward 
               her in the pool.

                                     gabriel
                         he wants the money.

                                     ashley
                         no, baby. he wants me.

               gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. she smiles.

                                     ashley
                         he wants... your "sister"...

                                     gabriel
                         ...whoever she is.

               and they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. 
               a steamy embrace.

                                     ashley
                         nick mason's gonna help us more than 
                         we ever dreamed.

               angle on rudy

               in the shadows, hearing them. staring into darkness.

               in the pool

               gabriel turns with ashley, wrapped together. moving slow.

                                     gabriel
                         all those letters are about to pay 
                         off, baby... all those letters...

                                     ashley
                         to all those cons...

                                     gabriel
                         searching for a money man...

                                     ashley
                         we musta written what, twenty of 
                         'em? and they were before this guy.  
                         one, two letters apiece, ten to the 
                         racetrack guy in leavenworth --

                                     gabriel
                         -- till he fucked his parole --

                                     ashley
                         -- plus the forty to mason... how 
                         many letters is that?

                                     gabriel
                         that's a book, baby.
                              (presses closer)
                         that's a book of love.

               they kiss again. gabriel strokes her wet hair:

                                     gabriel
                         i can't take watching you touch him.  
                         i can't take his hands on you.

                                     ashley
                         one more day, baby. one more day to 
                         christmas.

                                     gabriel
                         i've been doing good, though.

                                     ashley
                         didn't have to hit me so fucking 
                         hard. didn't have to throw me outta 
                         the goddamn truck.

                                     gabriel
                         didn't have to send me down a fucking 
                         mountain.

                                     ashley
                         what, he should see me help you catch 
                         him?

               on rudy

               still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.

                                     ashley (o.s.)
                         he's shown us the setup, he's drawn 
                         us the map, he's helped us do the 
                         plan. he wants a gun, give him a 
                         gun. take the bullets out, whatever, 
                         but give him the gun. the more 
                         manpower we've got in there, the 
                         better. he won't try and make his 
                         move till the money's in hand.

                                     gabriel (o.s.)
                         he'll be dead when he does.

               back in the pool

               gabriel and ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water.

                                     gabriel
                         y'know something, baby? if you were 
                         my sister? i'd still want to wake up 
                         christmas morning with you...

                                     ashley
                         mmm, baby. and i'd still want to be 
                         the tinsel round your tree...

               and as their words turn to moans and murmurs...

               in the shadows

               rudy is gone.
