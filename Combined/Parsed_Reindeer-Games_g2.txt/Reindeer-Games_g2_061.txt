               ext. woods - on chase - day

               rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper 
               into snowdrifts, slowing him down. stumbling forward, 
               shivering, breath frosting --

               -- as merlin, jumpy and pug reach the treeline. gaining but 
               struggling too. with guns held.

               rudy keeps battling through the drifts --

               -- as gunshots start to ring out. rudy glances back to rest; 
               the truckers are a hundred yards distant. but as he turns to 
               struggle on, treebark splits apart beside him.

               rudy keeps running.
