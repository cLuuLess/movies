               int. rudy's room - night - later

               pitch dark. rudy asleep on the floor, as ashley creeps back 
               in.

               seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket 
               over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.

                                     ashley
                         merry christmas-eve, my love. my 
                         love, my love. merry christmas-eve...

               ashley closes her eyes. with a smile.

               a moment later, rudy's eyes open. turning to look at her 
               smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...
