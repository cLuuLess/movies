               int. truck stop bathroom - night

               rudy slams in, letting the door smack shut behind him. it's 
               a tiny windowless closet. rudy kicks a stall door, pacing.

                                     rudy
                         ...goddamn it, rudy... goddamn it... 
                         goddamn girl, goddamn nick... you're 
                         so smart, so fucking smart...

               he stalks a circle, grabs a sink, and stares at his reflection 
               in the mirror. he looks a wreck. he settles down.

                                     rudy
                         where's your christmas dinner now...
