               ext. river beneath the ice

               -- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body 
               like needles. he writhes, spinning around --

               -- and sees ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at 
               the ice above her. strength giving out.

               rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. she fights, 
               panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further 
               away from the opening.

               with ashley safely in hand, rudy raises his rifle-arm, 
               pressing the barrel against the ice above them --

               -- and fires. a hole blasts a shaft of light into the gray-
               blue. rudy fires again. another hole caves in. ashley reaches 
               for a sheath of ice, splashing --

               to the surface

               -- clutching frozen ground, treading water. rudy surfaces 
               beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.

               instinctively, they spin around --

               to find gabriel, merlin, jumpy and pug

               -- standing right behind them. guns trained.

                                     gabriel
                              (rubs his jaw)
                         at the rate you're going, nick...  
                         i'm gonna have a hard time ever 
                         considering you family.

               he extends his hand, a gesture of help. but menacing.

                                     gabriel
                         how lucky ya feeling now.

                                                                    cut to:
