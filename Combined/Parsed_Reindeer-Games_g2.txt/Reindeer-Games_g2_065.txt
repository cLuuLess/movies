               ext. frozen river - continuous

               rudy and ashley race out across the ice. the traction's 
               slippery, but there's no way around. there's a highway bridge 
               two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.

                                     rudy
                         we get to the bridge, we're all right!

                                     ashley
                         nick, the ice is --

                                     rudy
                         get to the bridge!
                              (waving at traffic)
                         hey! hey! down here!

               he grips her hand tighter, as shots crash into the ice at 
               their feet. suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --

               -- and ashley goes plummeting through to the river! she 
               vanishes from sight in an instant!

               rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. he stares, stunned, at 
               the ripples in the freezing water.

               ashley's not coming up.

               rudy

               looks to the truckers in pursuit. coming down the ridge.

               then the highway. safety within sight.

               but he can't run. cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly 
               and leaps into the ice-hole --
