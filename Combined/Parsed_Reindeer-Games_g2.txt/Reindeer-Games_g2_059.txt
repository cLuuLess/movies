               ext. snowy meadow - day

               rudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. he keeps 
               struggling, losing his footing, fighting his way toward the 
               cover of trees. from far away...

                                     ashley (o.s.)
                         nick! run! run!!!

               rudy turns back to see merlin, jumpy and pug round into view 
               back at the parking lot. they see him.

               and charge into the snowfield.

               rudy breaks into the trees.
