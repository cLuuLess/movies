               ext. parking lot - night

               rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the 
               same blazer. he jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free 
               the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.  
               stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --

                                     rudy
                         catch, dammit, catch! like riding a 
                         bike, it's like riding a bike!

               but there's nothing. the engine won't start.
