               int. bathroom - same

               rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his 
               grip, ready to strike. listening... listening...

               as the door slams open, swinging fast and bashing him in the 
               head.

               rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out.

               merlin and pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. pug 
               spits tobacco. hits merlin's boots again.
