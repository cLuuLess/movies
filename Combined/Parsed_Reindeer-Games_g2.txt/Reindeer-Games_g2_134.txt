               ext. a suburban neighborhood - day

               a cul-de-sac of norman rockwell michigan homes. graced with 
               pines and a pristine snowfall. christmas trees in windows, 
               lights on inside, figures of families in holiday gear.

               no one noticing the man in the santa suit, his sacks long 
               gone, walking up the road.
