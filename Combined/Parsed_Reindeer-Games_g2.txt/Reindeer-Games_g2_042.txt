               int. hallway - morning

               rudy is brusquely dragged out by jumpy and merlin, passing 
               ashley, who lies asleep in the hall, head on a pillow.

                                     merlin
                         having romance problems, romeo?

                                     rudy
                         not with you.

               they march him onward. rudy glances over his shoulder at 
               ashley.

               who spent the night at his door.
