               int. truck stop - moments later

               rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. ashley reaches for 
               his hand; he pulls it away. gabriel unfolds a piece of paper -- 
               it's a crude map.

                                     gabriel
                         here ya go, convict. we cased the 
                         place in the fall, got the layout 
                         down. what you're gonna do is show 
                         us where each of these doors go, 
                         what the upstairs level looks like, 
                         where they got the alarms, all of 
                         it.

                                     merlin
                         and where they hide the real money.

               merlin exhales some smoke in pug's face. pug hacks, shoves 
               him.

                                     gabriel
                         and nick? if you even think about 
                         setting us up, giving us some bad 
                         information? we go down... you go 
                         down...
                              (lets it settle)
                         now. christmas eve. how many guards 
                         are there gonna be?

               rudy surveys the table. all five waiting for him. sighs.

                                     rudy
                         hell. ten?

                                     gabriel
                         and which of these doors here lead 
                         up to the security level?

               gabriel passes the map across the table. rudy stares at it.

                                     merlin
                         start talking, nick.

               rudy's still staring.

                                     pug
                         start talkin

                                     rudy
                         who the hell made this map.

                                     gabriel
                         what?

                                     rudy
                         i said, who the hell made the map?

                                     gabriel
                         i did.

                                     rudy
                         this isn't the tomahawk.

                                     gabriel
                         what the fuck are you talking about.

                                     rudy
                         this is the front entrance, right?  
                         you get through the slots, you hit 
                         craps here, not blackjack. blackjack's 
                         here to here -- lined up. what's 
                         this, the cage? cage is over there, 
                         hard to get to, you got it all mixed 
                         around --

                                     pug
                         that's what it looks like!

                                     rudy
                         since when? what the hell is this 
                         room?

                                     merlin
                         buffet. whaddya think it is?

                                     rudy
                         buffet is by the goddamn bar! what 
                         the hell kind of map is this?!

               gabriel reaches across the booth, grabs rudy's shirt, pulls 
               his face to table level:

                                     gabriel
                         we walked the place for a week.

                                     rudy
                         and i worked there. for a year.

               neither man blinks.

                                     pug
                         map is kinda dirty, monster...

                                     rudy
                         they changed the layout.

                                     gabriel
                         what?

               rudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon.

                                     rudy
                         they changed the layout -- whadda 
                         they call you? mr. monster? they 
                         remodeled the place. when i worked 
                         there -- listen to me -- guy that 
                         managed the joint, guy who ran it--

                                     ashley
                         jack. jack bangs.

                                     rudy
                         right, jack bangs. uh... guy was 
                         always talking bout fixing the place 
                         up. maybe get a better crowd. musta 
                         gone and done it while i was in the 
                         mountain.
                              (pushes map away)
                         i don't know this map, man. how the 
                         hell am i supposed to tell you what 
                         door goes where?

                                     gabriel
                         they wouldn't have changed the 
                         security setup.

                                     rudy
                         when i worked there, this was bangs, 
                         office. back here. he kept a little 
                         safe in the... uh, the wall, money 
                         held take for himself, skim from the 
                         indians. called it the... uh...
                              (stumbling)
                         ...the powwow safe.

                                     jumpy
                         the powwow safe?

                                     rudy
                         his personal safe, he gave it a name.  
                         now you're telling me they've taken 
                         his office, put the buffet there?  
                         then who knows what else they changed.

               gabriel stares at him, suspicious.

                                     gabriel
                         so what the hell good are you...

                                     rudy
                         you'd have to get me inside.
                              (carefully)
                         get inside, watch where the money's 
                         moving, see where the guards are 
                         going. then i could work with your 
                         map.

                                     gabriel
                         wrong, convict. you walk in there, 
                         they recognize you.

                                     pug
                         so what?

                                     gabriel
                         they recognize him, they'll remember 
                         him after the job goes down.

                                     rudy
                         they won't recognize me.

                                     gabriel
                         why not.

                                     rudy
                         trust me. they won't recognize me.

                                     gabriel
                         we'll trust you when we're rich. why 
                         not.

                                     rudy
                         'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.

               rudy locks eyes with gabriel.

                                     rudy
                         i give you the wrong information, 
                         you're gonna shoot me. well, i don't 
                         know your damn map. so you can either 
                         find a way to get me in there... or 
                         you can shoot me right now.

               a waitress comes over, drops their check on the table. it 
               rests near rudy. rudy locks eyes with gabriel.

               and pushes the check his way.
