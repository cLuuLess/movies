               int. tomahawk

               -- while merlin dives out of the cage, joining jumpy, taking 
               cover as the count men fire away --

               -- as rudy scrambles back from the bar --

                                     merlin
                         you said no guns in there! no guns!

               merlin and jumpy leap up, guns blazing, firing through the 
               cage bars at the count men. killing all three just as --

               the off-duty firemen

               storm through the doors, pistols ready --

                                     firemen
                         drop it! drop the guns!

               merlin and jumpy are caught. trade a look. and let their 
               weapons fall, turning just as --

               the chevy nova

               crashes through the casino doors, mowing down the firemen!

               the car slams inside, crashing into slot machines. the slots 
               send sparks showering into the air. which set off the casino 
               floor's sprinklers. the room fills with watery spray.

               ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. rudy stares 
               darkly at her. she knows he knows. and she doesn't care.

                                     ashley
                              (wild-eyed)
                         where's the fucking cash, nick!

                                     rudy
                         yeah. that's love.

               she storms on by. the slots pay off behind her.
