               int. tomahawk

               jumpy has left the table, sidling to a change booth, glancing 
               at his watch. passes a $100 bill:

                                     jumpy
                         could fat-man-with-flying-horse get 
                         some quarters, please?

               at the blackjack

               gabriel slides off his stool, punches rudy in the shoulder:

                                     gabriel
                         be back, wal-mart. watch my bank.

               rudy nods, slugging beer. he's becoming an unruly drinker. 
               the old timer motions to hit; but before the dealer can pull 
               the card, rudy slams the table, points to it:

                                     rudy
                         that is my card, guy. my card.

                                     dealer
                         he hit, mister.

                                     rudy
                         he didn't hit.
                              (to old timer)
                         you didn't hit. you're not hitting.

                                     old timer
                         but you don't even know what it is!

               the dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. then hits rudy and 
               busts him. rudy stares darkly.

               in the hall to the bathrooms

               gabriel walks to the men's room door. then stops. adjusts 
               the rifle under his red coat. and turns back.

               at the change booth

               jumpy is handed a bucket of quarters.
