               int. gabriel's rig - trailer - night

               close on rudy

               eyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. he 
               winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches.

                                     ashley (o.s.)
                         shh, nick, shh. they won't hurt you 
                         now. you're okay...

               her hand strokes his face. rudy's eyes struggle open.

               on full scene

               they're in the back of the truck. there's some packing mats, 
               rope, two tall storage lockers, and ashley's chevy nova.

               rudy's head is in her lap. he struggles to sit up, finds his 
               wrists tied with cord. he looks at ashley, follows her gaze.

               in a corner, pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. he's dipping 
               chewing tobacco, reading road & track, headphones on. gives 
               rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine.

                                     ashley
                         i won't let 'em, nick. they won't 
                         hurt you anymore.

                                     rudy
                         your brother...

               ashley nods. rudy looks around, remembering.

                                     rudy
                         ...the truck driver...

                                     ashley
                         he's not a bad person, nick... he's 
                         not...

               from the corner, pug spits some chaw. ashley wheels.

                                     ashley
                         you're not gonna hurt him anymore!

               pug doesn't even look up. still stroking rudy's face:

                                     ashley
                         since janey moved in... gabriel... 
                         he's come over more and more. to the 
                         apartment. janey's the divorced one, 
                         'member, with the tit job --

                                     rudy
                         what the fuck is going on.

                                     ashley
                         he read the letters, nick. some day 
                         i wasn't there. he went through my 
                         room. he found your letters.

                                     rudy
                         what's going on!!!

               the truck shakes.

                                     ashley
                         he knows you worked in that casino.

               rudy stares at her. she's scared

                                     rudy
                         you motherfucker.

                                     ashley
                         nick, no --

                                     rudy
                         you sold him out.

                                     ashley
                         nick --

                                     rudy
                         when'd you decide to do it, ash?  
                         after which of his letters, huh?  
                         the fortieth? the fiftieth? the 
                         first?!

                                     ashley
                         nick, what are you --

               she reaches out for him; rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles 
               against the opposite wall of the trailer.

                                     rudy
                         i'm not nick!
                              (raging)
                         you thought you'd fuck him over?!  
                         well he's fucked you! i've never 
                         worked at some casino! i can't help 
                         you! because he's not me!

                                     ashley
                         nick, i love you --

                                     rudy
                         jesus christ!

                                     pug
                         watch your mouth, man. it's christmas.

                                     rudy
                         i'm not nick!

               ashley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. he 
               tries to fight her off. she won't let go.

                                     rudy
                         get the hell off of me!

                                     ashley
                              (hard whisper)
                         nick, it won't work. it won't work!

               rudy stops fighting. she has a terrified look in her eye. 
               checks to pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. ashley 
               turns them away from the little guy's view

                                     ashley
                         he'll kill you.

                                     rudy
                         you're not hearing me here --

                                     ashley
                         my brother's killed people, i know 
                         he has. truckers. if you talk him 
                         into thinking you're not you, you'll 
                         only get yourself dead.

                                     rudy
                         he didn't "find" nick's letters, did 
                         he.

                                     ashley
                         nick, please, it's me --

                                     rudy
                         you told him about nick's letters.

                                     ashley
                         no, nick, no --

                                     rudy
                         you're in on this.

                                     ashley
                         i love you!

               rudy stares at her coldly.

                                     rudy
                         y'know, in a way, i'm glad it's me. 
                         'cause you woulda broken his heart.

               ashley stares, panicked. pug's still watching them.

                                     rudy
                         your pen palls dead, lady.

                                     ashley
                         if you say that, if you keep saying 
                         that, they will kill you. if they 
                         think you're not you, they will kill 
                         you. don't you see? i know what you're 
                         doing, but it won't work!

                                     rudy
                         nick died for me....

                                     ashley
                         i won't let him hurt you! he just 
                         wants what you know!

                                     rudy
                              (ruefully)
                         ...maybe i die for nick...

                                     ashley
                         just tell him what you know, nick! 
                         that's all they want! and we'll get 
                         out of this!

               rudy gives her a stone cold stare. ashley crumbles, touching 
               his face, shaking her head, tears. devastated.

                                     ashley
                         he found them... i swear, nick...
                              (helpless)
                         ...he found them...

               the truck shudders through downshifts, to a groaning stop. 
               ashley embraces rudy fiercely, holding on for the last.

               the trailer gate rattles open into the truck's roof.

               ashley shuts her eyes.
