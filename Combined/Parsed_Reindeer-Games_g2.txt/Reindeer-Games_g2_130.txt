               ext. ridgeside road - night

               a winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a 
               grassy overlook. the road is dusted with snow; there's been 
               no traffic here for awhile.

               the motor city monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. 
               then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is 
               fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.

               a hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.

               gabriel and ashley pile out of the cab. they lift the trailer 
               gate, extend the tire ramps. the ramps run from the trailer 
               to five feet away from, the ravine drop.

               in the cab

               gabriel pulls rudy out of the sleeper. marches him back --

               to the ravine's edge

               -- and gives him a look. forces him to his knees. ashley is 
               in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the nova with 
               a can of gasoline.

                                     gabriel
                         you almost got away with it, santa. 
                         got outta the tomahawk, got to your 
                         car, got halfway to canada till you 
                         caught some ice in the road. by the 
                         time you hit bottom down there, whole 
                         car was burning like a comet.  musta 
                         burned up all that money too.

               rudy glances to the trailer. ashley tosses a couple handfuls 
               of bills into the car.

                                     gabriel
                         buncha guys in red suits busted in, 
                         they'll say. started shooting. they 
                         won't be able to remember... if it 
                         was three, or four... or five. four 
                         dead santas and some burned-up cash. 
                         merry christmas, the end.

                                     rudy
                         was it your plan, monster? or was it 
                         hers.

               gabriel smiles at him.

                                     gabriel
                         she told me 'bout the convict 
                         magazines. had to figure there'd be 
                         some boys in the pen with some useful 
                         knowledge. with nobody to talk to. 
                         nobody to listen. so we stocked up 
                         on stationery.

               ashley hops down. gabriel puts an arm around her.

                                     gabriel
                         hard life being a trucker's girl.

               rudy eyes ashley. she stares darkly back.

                                     rudy
                         i saved your life.

                                     ashley
                         you shouldn't have.

                                     rudy
                         he did love you, you know. nick. he 
                         did love you.

                                     ashley
                         who wouldn't.

               so cold. but rudy doesn't pause.

                                     rudy
                         maybe this is where you wanted him, 
                         ashley. at the bottom of a ravine, 
                         dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. 
                         maybe. but it didn't happen. 'cause 
                         what you did for him was make him 
                         the happiest held ever been. you 
                         showed him hope and taught him mercy.  
                         and he died a peaceful man. you wanted 
                         to destroy some convict... and all 
                         you did was save his soul. remember 
                         that. love your money and remember 
                         that.

               ashley shivers, a touch shaken. but steels herself:

                                     ashley
                         merry christmas, rudy.

                                     rudy
                         i'm glad it was me.

                                     ashley
                         merry christmas.

                                     gabriel
                         get in the car.

               gabriel hauls him up. marches him to the trailer. rudy stops 
               at the ramp. gabriel pushes. rudy doesn't move.

                                     gabriel
                         get in the car!

                                     rudy
                         how'd you know my name...

               he turns back to ashley.

                                     ashley
                         what?

                                     rudy
                         rudy. how'd you know my name?

                                     ashley
                         what are you talking about?

               rudy looks at gabriel. he's frowning. to ashley:

                                     rudy
                         you said merry christmas, rudy.

                                     ashley
                         i... you told me your name was rudy. 
                         you told me a million times, back in 
                         the truck, telling me you weren't 
                         nick --

                                     rudy
                         no --

                                     ashley
                         you were screaming you weren't nick! 
                         and we just didn't fucking believe 
                         you!

                                     rudy
                         but i never said rudy.

                                     ashley
                         you said it a million times!

                                     rudy
                         i never told you my name.

               he stares her down. then stares at gabriel.

                                     gabriel
                         ash?

                                     rudy
                         how'd you know my name was rudy.

                                     gabriel
                         ash?

                                     rudy
                         how'd you know my name.

               ashley stares daggers. shakes her head ruefully --

                                     ashley
                         men.

               -- and pulls a handgun, shooting gabriel in the heart.

               gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of 
               shock. blood spurts through his red coat. he stares at ashley, 
               incredulous.

               she steps forward and puts another bullet in his neck. gabriel 
               falls still.

               ashley's breath frosts in the cold.

               rudy watches her. finally, she meets rudy's eyes. they stare 
               each other down for a long moment, before:

                                     rudy
                         where is he.

               a silence.

               no one moves.

               and finally, the crunch of footsteps from around the side of 
               the trailer. and whistling. "silver bells."

               a shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon 
               steps into rudy and ashley's view.

               it's nick mason.

               alive and well.

                                     nick
                         merry christmas, rudy.

               ashley smiles. her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.

                                     nick
                         i missed you, beautiful.

                                     ashley
                         i missed you too, nicky baby.

               they share a passionate kiss. ashley malts at the sight of 
               him, embracing happily. then turns to rudy:

                                     ashley
                         for your information. i never fuck 
                         the wrong guy.

               rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.

                                     nick
                         oh, hey. have you two been properly 
                         introduced? sweetness, this is rudy 
                         duncan, i did almost a year with him 
                         in the mountain. read him all your 
                         letters, talked about you all the 
                         time, made him feel like he really 
                         knew you.
                              (turns to rudy)

                         talk about her much once the ashley 
                         letters started coming, i guess.

               rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.

                                     nick
                         millie here used to serve drinks to 
                         these gunrunning truckers, real big 
                         talkers, talking bout a real score 
                         one day. i was in the mountain, man, 
                         what the hell, why not let her get 
                         friendly with 'em? let her tell 'em 
                         an idea she had, 'bout writing guys 
                         in prison. getting one who could 
                         show 'em a sure thing.

                                     rudy
                         she set them up. all of them.

                                     nick
                         why not have her pretend to find me?  
                         pretend to write me and reel me in?  
                         tell her new trucker-man she'd pose 
                         as some sister of his named ashley?

                                     rudy
                         and you set me up.

                                     nick
                         always wanted to rob that casino, 
                         rudy. way back when i worked there.  
                         what better way than to get some 
                         guys to rob it for me.

               nick shrugs. prods rudy up the ramp. into the trailer:

                                     nick
                         paid the alamo ten bucks to put the 
                         shiv in me. he's a lifer, what does 
                         he care. paid a hospital guard fifty 
                         to put out the story i was dead. 
                         once the wound healed up...
                              (notes cash-sacks)
                         got out of the mountain this morning.  
                         and tonight i'm a rich man.

                                     rudy
                         how'd you know i'd do it.

                                     nick
                         do what?

                                     rudy
                         walk outta there and tell her i was 
                         you.

               nick looks back at ashley.

                                     nick
                         because every time i read her letters, 
                         rudy... you listened.
                              (to ashley)
                         keep your gun on him.

               nick forces rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and 
               lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.

                                     nick
                         five santas walked into that tomahawk, 
                         rudy. that's what the witnesses'll 
                         say. so we gotta have five santas 
                         not walk out. gotta have five...
                              (working)
                         this'll burn right away... in the 
                         fire...

               nick gets rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. he laughs.

                                     nick
                         hell, you never needed to convince 
                         ashley you were me. just the dumb 
                         fucking truckers. i figured i'd talked 
                         enough about the tomahawk in the pen 
                         for you to get by --

                                     rudy
                         talked about the old man's weapons 
                         stash, probably forgot i'd remember

                                     nick
                         hm. well. they'd have killed you if 
                         you weren't me, rudy. we knew you'd 
                         start convincing 'em soon enough.

               nick slams the car door, locking rudy in.

                                     nick
                         they had the weapons and the 
                         willpower. we just gave them their 
                         inside man.

                                     rudy
                         you gave them me.

                                     nick
                         i gave them me.
                              (shrugs, smiles)
                         said some nice things about me, rudy. 
                         i appreciate it. but don't worry. i 
                         do love her. and she loves me. you 
                         had that right all along.

               nick reaches across him, releases the brake. puts the car 
               into "drive." turns to ashley:

                                     nick
                         sweetness! let's light up the tree!

               ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. nick 
               steps further into the trailer, to the back of the nova.

               in the car

               rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his 
               wrists together. trying to press together the white cuffs of 
               his santa suit. trying to get the right pressure point --

               -- as a blade suddenly springs out of the cuff! the 
               switchblade he'd stolen from the blazer -- it's lashed to 
               his right wrist!

               rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through 
               the santa belt --

               -- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either 
               ashley or nick to see --

               in the trailer

               ashley is at the hood of the car, lighting her match. nick 
               is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --

                                     nick
                         goodbye, rudy! nice spending time 
                         with you!

               in the car

               the belt breaks! rudy snaps his hands free! but instead of 
               trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, 
               ripping its panel away and pulling wires free!

               as ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and fire races 
               over the body of the car, tongues racing inside, over the 
               dash, over the seats, lapping at rudy --

               -- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate 
               the right leads --

               in the trailer

               ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. nick pushes the 
               flaming car to the trailer's edge --

               -- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --

               -- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --

               in the car

               rudy sparks two wires together, flames eating at him --

                                     rudy
                         like riding a bike, like riding a 
                         bike, like riding a biiiiike!

               -- and the engine ignites!

               rudy slams the gearshift into "reverse", grabs the wheel and 
               looks over his shoulder at shocked nick behind him --

                                     rudy
                         rule one! never put a car thief behind 
                         the wheel!

               -- and slams the accelerator.

               on full scene

               as the burning nova races backwards up the ramp, and back 
               into the trailer --

               terrified nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --

               -- and the car slams into the trailer's back, crushing nick's 
               legs between metal and metal!

                                     ashley
                         nooooooo!!!

               then rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "drive."

                                     rudy
                         rule two!

               ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage. 
               she grabs her handgun, opens fire --

               -- and rudy slams the gas again, shooting down the ramp --

               -- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --

               -- while the burning nova collides with ashley, throwing her 
               onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off 
               the ridgetop --

               -- arcing slowly as it plummets into the ravine, a smoking, 
               blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.

               the shooting star hits earth and explodes.

                                                          slow dissolve to:
