               int. hotel room

               -- his quarters. jumpy marches rudy to the bed, snaps a 
               handcuff around his ankle --

                                     rudy
                         what the hell is this? what happened 
                         to working together?

               -- and snaps the other cuff to the bedframe.

                                     gabriel
                         rather be back in the mountain?

                                     rudy
                         might as well be.

                                     gabriel
                         don't have weather channel in the 
                         mountain, nick.

               gabriel tosses him a tv remote. merlin rips the room's phone 
               out of the wall, takes it. they return to the hallway.

                                     gabriel
                         sleep good, loverboy. tomorrow you 
                         got singing for your supper to do.

               the truckers leave. rudy tugs at his ankle cuff, sighs, 
               collapses back on the bed. ashley has remained.

               rudy sits up, sees her.

                                     rudy
                         get your own room.

               she approaches instead. sits beside. gently:

                                     ashley
                         he said he wanted to talk to you.  
                         when he found the letters... he said 
                         "when your boyfriend gets out, i 
                         wanna talk to him." i thought he 
                         meant back in detroit. i thought he 
                         meant --

                                     rudy
                         but you knew why. knew why, didn't 
                         ya.

               ashley stands her ground, guilty.

                                     ashley
                         i thought we'd have a few more days.

                                     rudy
                         for what? you to talk me into 
                         "helping"? what, he promise you a 
                         share of the winnings?

                                     ashley
                         no!

                                     rudy
                         well, shit, judas, you shoulda at 
                         least gotten that --

                                     ashley
                         nick! he wants to know how to rob 
                         it, and he'll leave you alone! that's 
                         all he wants!
                              (breaking down)
                         i hate him, nick... you know how...

                                     rudy
                         so get him outta your life. get out 
                         of michigan. they got perfume counters 
                         in chicago, don't they?

                                     ashley
                         not without you.

               she reaches to touch him. rudy turns his back on her.

                                     rudy
                         since when do some trucker pals start 
                         thinking big, anyway?

                                     ashley
                         they run routes mostly east, retail 
                         stuff, warehouses. but gabriel knows 
                         some guys in new york, miami, guys 
                         he helps get guns to detroit. hides 
                         'em with his regular loads.

                                     rudy
                         he working for them on this one?

                                     ashley
                         no. he wants to be working for himself 
                         someday.

                                     rudy
                         and i'm his ticket.
                              (considers)
                         what's the last place they took down?

                                     ashley
                         what?

                                     rudy
                         gabriel and his guys. what's the 
                         last place they robbed?

               ashley frowns.

                                     ashley
                         i don't think they've ever robbed 
                         anything before. i think they've 
                         just driven guns.

               rudy looks at her with new interest.

                                     rudy
                         they've never done a robbery?

                                     ashley
                              (shrugs)
                         they're truck drivers.

               for the first time in a long time... rudy smiles.

                                     rudy
                         then they do need me, don't they.  
                         they really need me...

                                     ashley
                         we're gonna get out of here, nick.  
                         we're gonna get out of this...

                                     rudy
                         we? what "we"...

               rudy stares at her. the smile gone.

                                     rudy
                         get your own room, ashley.

                                     ashley
                         nick...

                                     rudy
                         get your own room.

               ashley pulls away, walks to the door. turns back, wanting to 
               say something, but rudy's not even looking her way.

                                     ashley
                         if i'd told you what he wanted, you'd 
                         have been gone. you'd have gotten on 
                         that bus and stayed on it. and if 
                         that's selfish, i am. if that's lying, 
                         i'm a liar. but i been dealing with 
                         fucked-up brother and his fucked-up 
                         friends for a long time, and i was 
                         stronger than him then and i'm 
                         stronger than him now. 'cause he 
                         showed up for money. i showed up for 
                         love.
                              (hard)
                         and if you're so ready to make me 
                         your enemy... then what did you show 
                         up for, nick. what did you really 
                         want... with me...

               with a fiery look, she strides from the room.

               rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. checks the end 
               table, finds a bible and a deck of cards.

               out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking 
               lot.

               rudy watches as a chevy blazer parks and two drunk fishermen 
               get out. the truck's bumper sticker reads "ice fishermen do 
               it all year long."

               rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. he 
               turns back, surveys his new prison cell

                                     rudy
                         they've never done a robbery...
                              (nods)
                         christmas is looking up.
