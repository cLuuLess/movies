               int. rudy's room

               -- and as merlin opens the door, he finds rudy sitting calmly 
               on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. 
               spreading a deck of cards out before him.

               starting a game of solitaire. he looks up.

                                     rudy
                         hey.

               merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. the 
               window's open. rudy continues his card game.

               merlin watches him for a long time. then pulls the door shut.

               once he's gone, rudy collapses to the floor. breathing hard, 
               heart pounding. the cards go flying.
