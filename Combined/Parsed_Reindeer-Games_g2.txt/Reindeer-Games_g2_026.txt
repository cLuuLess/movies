               int. motel room - night

               pitch dark. rudy fumbles his way in:

                                     rudy
                         ...but i got a girl to be with, rum-
                         pum-pum-pum...

                                     merlin (o.s.)
                         hi, nick.

               rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky 
               black shadow, merlin, all 280 pounds of him, kicks the door 
               shut --

                                     rudy
                         what the fuck --

               -- and swings a baseball bat toward rudy's chest. rudy gets 
               an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a 
               mother. rudy howls. merlin comes at him again --

               -- and this time rudy slips by. merlin's bat shatters a 
               dresser.

               rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests 
               him to the ground. grabs the bat --

               -- and gets decked from behind by another shadow, pug, a 
               little white guy with a snarl. they go crashing onto the 
               bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --

               -- where rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries 
               and bashes it backwards, shattering it over pug's head!

               pug lets go, as rudy scrambles up, and merlin's got him again 
               in a bear hug. rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing 
               into one wall, then another, yelling for help --

                                     rudy
                         heyyy!!! in here!!! heyyy!!!

               -- until he hears the pump-load snap of a shotgun.

               rudy stops still. a lamp clicks on.

               standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a 
               sawed-off on him.

                                     gabriel
                         welcome home, nick.

               another lamp comes on. rudy, still in merlin's choke-hold, 
               gets a look at the gunman, gabriel. weathered face, stringy 
               hair, early 30's. handsome in a scuzzy way. he's seen a lot 
               of road.

               rudy stares, totally thrown. pug, the little guy, bad teeth, 
               bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.

                                     pug
                         i owe ya a drink, ya fuck --

               -- and slugs rudy in the gut. merlin yanks him back up. 
               merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. 
               behind merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced indian 
               in a grateful dead longsleeve. jumpy. guarding the door.

               gabriel's studying rudy, up and down. nods. merlin relaxes 
               his choke-hold so rudy can breathe.

                                     rudy
                         you... you don't know me --

                                     gabriel
                         oh, i know you, nick. i know you 
                         real well.

                                     rudy
                         no, you can't --

                                     gabriel
                         the hell i can't.

               as the room's door gets kicked open --

                                     ashley
                         watch out, baby! i'm bringing in the 
                         fucking tree!

               and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting 
               forced through with ashley's grunts and groans --

                                     rudy
                         ashley!

               merlin traps his jaw shut. the tree comes squeezing through, 
               followed by ashley, face in branches --

                                     ashley
                         i'm telling you, we got the best one 
                         in the store... i don't know why 
                         people want their houses smelling 
                         like the stupid woods...

               she's grabbed from behind by jumpy. ashley screams, but he 
               slams her against the wall. the tree hits the ground.

                                     rudy
                         no!

                                     ashley
                         nick!

               rudy fights to help her, but merlin's got him. pug locks 
               ashley's arms. she fights, muffled cries, but jumpy and pug 
               have her held firmly. her face to the wall --

                                     gabriel
                              (re: the silver tree)
                         hope her taste in men's better than 
                         her taste in christmas.

               ashley's turned to face him. her eyes widen. gabriel nods.

                                     gabriel
                         hey, sis. happy holidays.

               rudy's jaw drops. he looks to ashley. then to gabriel.

               ashley yells, enraged, kicking and clawing. jumpy slams her 
               back against the wall for her trouble --

                                     gabriel
                         jumpy, don't hurt her, now.

               gabriel steps to rudy. studies him.

                                     gabriel
                         so. this is the guy you been waiting 
                         for. man of your dreams.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel -- !

                                     gabriel
                              (unimpressed)
                         must have a way with stationery.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel, what are you doing!

               gabriel raises the sawed-off to rudy's chest. rudy flinches, 
               but merlin's got him.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel!!!

               gabriel fixes her with a stare. she shuts up. to rudy:

                                     gabriel
                         you better be here to be good to 
                         her, loverboy. 'cause she's been 
                         good to you.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel, let him go --

                                     gabriel
                         read a lot about you, nick.

                                     ashley
                         what are you doing here?!

                                     gabriel
                         read you're a man of some knowledge.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel!

                                     gabriel
                         a man of some travels.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel, i love him!

               rudy's trying to speak, voice choked. gabriel nods to merlin, 
               who again eases his hold. rudy coughs.

                                     rudy
                         i'm... not... nick...

               gabriel frowns. rudy turns to ashley.

                                     rudy
                         i'm not him. i...
                              (then to gabriel)
                         you want something from nick, you 
                         got the wrong guy.

                                     ashley
                              (hurt)
                         nick...

               gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed-off, 
               and swings it into rudy's stomach. rudy buckles. panicked.

                                     gabriel
                         who are you now.

                                     rudy
                         you got the wrong guy! she thinks 
                         i'm nick, i'm not!

                                     gabriel
                              (to merlin)
                         put him in the truck.

                                     rudy
                         i was in the joint with him! i knew 
                         about him and her, okay!? i took his 
                         place!

                                     gabriel
                         you what...

                                     rudy
                         i got out, nick didn't! i pretended 
                         i was him! i knew about her letters!  
                         jesus christ, whatever you want from 
                         him -- i'm not nick!
                              (to ashley)
                         i -- i just wanted to be --

               a glance of regret amidst his desperation. ashley stares 
               back, confused, searching his eyes.

                                     gabriel
                         you're not nick mason...

                                     rudy
                         i shared his cell!

                                     gabriel
                         but you were saying you were...

                                     rudy
                         yes!

                                     gabriel
                         so you could get with my sister.

                                     rudy
                         yes!

                                     gabriel
                         so you could get down her chimney.

                                     rudy
                         yes!

                                     gabriel
                         and you think telling me that's gonna 
                         help your cause.

               gabriel ratchets him across the chin with the gun butt. rudy 
               hits the floor. gabriel spins on ashley, enraged:

                                     gabriel
                         is this him!?

                                     ashley
                              (reaches for rudy)
                         don't hurt him...

                                     gabriel
                         is this the fucker you been writing 
                         all year!?

                                     ashley
                              (reaches for rudy)
                         please, gabriel, don't...

               gabriel puts the gun to rudy's head.

                                     gabriel
                         is this nick mason!!??

                                     ashley
                         yes!!!

               gabriel doesn't shoot. studies rudy.

                                     gabriel
                         well, he's gonna have to learn to 
                         give you some respect.

               gabriel kicks rudy in the jaw. ashley screams. gabriel motions 
               to his boys: jumpy and pug drag her outside. gabriel kicks 
               rudy again. rudy lies there and takes it.

               merlin lights a cig, examines rudy and ashley's grocery bags:

                                     merlin
                         hey. they got a shitload of cookies.

                                     gabriel
                         take 'em.

                                     merlin
                         how 'bout the tree? you want the 
                         tree?

                                     gabriel
                         leave the tree.

               merlin nods, tucks the bags under his arms, leaves the room.

               gabriel drops beside rudy, with a sick smile:

                                     gabriel
                         i've read your letters, motherfucker.  
                         don't play no reindeer games with 
                         me.
