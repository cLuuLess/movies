               int. rudy's room - day

               rudy gets hurled inside by merlin and jumpy. he hits the 
               floor beside the bed, where ashley sits prisoner. pug sits 
               guard, watching "how the grinch stole christmas" on tv.

                                     ashley
                         nick! jesus, nick --

               she falls to his side. merlin cuffs rudy's ankle again to 
               the bedframe. he and jumpy head out --

                                     merlin
                         pug.

               pug's engrossed in the cartoon. they're singing in whoville.

                                     merlin
                         pug!

               pug snaps to. shuts off the tv, spits some chaw on the floor 
               and gone. rudy and ashley are left alone.

                                     ashley
                         nick, oh my god, what'd he do to 
                         you? what'd he do?

               she touches his bloodied chest. rudy winces badly.

                                     rudy
                         he had some points to make...

               ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:

                                     ashley
                         jesus christ, stay here, don't move, 
                         stay right here --

                                     rudy
                              (near-delirium)
                         all i wanted... was to make it home... 
                         for a little of dad's turkey, and 
                         mom's stuffing... aunt lisbeth's 
                         acorn gravy... aunt mary's cranberry 
                         buns...

               ashley has leapt to the bathroom. she brings wet washcloths 
               back to clean and dress --

                                     ashley
                         we'll get there, baby... we'll get 
                         there...

                                     rudy
                         ...haven't had cranberry buns... in 
                         five whole years...

                                     ashley
                         shh, now. rest now. two years, nick. 
                         you haven't had cranberry buns in 
                         two years.

               she kisses him softly. rudy meets her eyes. staring to get 
               his bearings back...

                                     ashley
                         you saved my life.
                              (beat)
                         you could have run, but you didn't. 
                         you saved me.

                                     rudy
                         you saved me.

                                     ashley
                         i saved you because i love you, nick.
                              (smiles)
                         why'd you save me?

               rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still 
               weak and distant:

                                     rudy
                         guy i was in with... car thief... i 
                         used to read your letters to him. i 
                         know they were private... i know, 
                         but... you spend twenty-four hours a 
                         day with somebody, you gotta talk, 
                         y'know? you gotta share. or the room 
                         gets even smaller.
                              (beat)
                         and sometimes, i'd be reading them, 
                         and he'd close his eyes, get a smile 
                         on his face... and i'd know somewhere 
                         inside he was pretending you were 
                         writing to him -- he'd see your face, 
                         your pictures on the wall...
                              (beat)
                         some nights i think he fell in love 
                         with you, too.

               rudy touches a hand to her hair.

                                     rudy
                         you gave a couple guys hope, ashley.  
                         and with hope, there ain't nothing 
                         you can't survive.

               ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his 
               chest.

               rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. she kisses him 
               tenderly. lingering.

               and this time rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her 
               neck.

               her eyes flutter closed.

                                     ashley
                         i'm sorry, nick... i'm so sorry...

                                     rudy
                         don't say my name...

                                     ashley
                         i love you, nick...

                                     rudy
                         ash. don't say it. don't say my name.

               ashley hesitates. carefully strokes his chest. he's still 
               kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.

                                     ashley
                              (a small frown)
                         i love you...

               as he returns to her lips, mouths joining. ashley's eyes 
               close again, as they fold into each other...

               ...and move slowly, tenderly, back to the floor.
