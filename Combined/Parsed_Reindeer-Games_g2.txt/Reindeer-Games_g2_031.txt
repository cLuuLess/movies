               int. truck stop - night

               close on hot chocolate and pecan pie 

               the six of them sit in a booth, ashley leaning on rudy's 
               shoulder apologetically. the four truckers watch him scarf 
               his pie. "white christmas" plays over the speakers.

                                     gabriel
                         so when you worked there --

               rudy raises a finger sharply. silence. he continues eating.  
               scrapes the last of his pie crumbs.

                                     gabriel
                         you knew the place --

                                     rudy
                         hey.

               rudy stares hard. gobbles the crumbs, washes it down with 
               his hot chocolate. savors it. sets the mug down.

                                     rudy
                         y'know, i could really go for some 
                         onion rings.

               gabriel nods to jumpy, who snaps his arm up, smashing his 
               knuckles into rudy's face.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel! you said talk to him. that's 
                         all you ever said...

                                     gabriel
                         we're talking, aren't we?

               rudy holds his nose. blood trickles.

                                     gabriel
                         how much money's in that casino?  
                         day-to-day.

                                     rudy
                         i don't know.

                                     gabriel
                         the hell you don't.

                                     rudy
                              (sighs, a guess)
                         five million?

                                     gabriel
                         you wrote ash that letter, you told 
                         her that story 'bout working christmas 
                         eve, bout how they'd send half the 
                         security guys home, nobody comin, in 
                         that night. and the rest of you got 
                         shit-faced drinking hot buttered 
                         rum. that a true story now?

                                     rudy
                         christmas... eve...

                                     gabriel
                         you know where the guards are. you 
                         know how to get in and out. you know 
                         where the money is.
                              (nods)

                         convict. you're the guy gonna tell 
                         us how.

               rudy turns slightly pale.

                                     rudy
                         hey, it's... been two years --

                                     gabriel
                         we got faith in you, nick mason.
                              (smiles)
                         you're our inside man.
