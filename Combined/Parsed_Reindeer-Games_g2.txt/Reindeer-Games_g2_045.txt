                         y'know what, guys? i woke up this 
                         morning, i got a really lucky feeling 
                         going on. i mean it, i'm feeling 
                         that good. i wouldn't be surprised 
                         if i walk in there, pull a handle 
                         and hit jackpot. hell, we wouldn't
