               as the college kid, in rudy's black getup, strides out of 
               the bathroom hall, walking for the casino exit.

               from the slots, ashley and jumpy glance up, seeing him go. 
               from their vantage, it looks like rudy. they frown.

               as they're watching the kid hit the door, rudy darts out of 
               the hall, heads the other way.
