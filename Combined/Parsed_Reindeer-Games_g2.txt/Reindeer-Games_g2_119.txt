               the two guards lie on the floor, with security boss and video 
               guard. and the ruined jack bangs.

                                     jack bangs
                         no... not here... please... mister...

               gabriel storms to the video room's doorway. slams a new clip.

                                     jack bangs
                         mister. i'm begging, 'kay? i'm 
                         begging. this is not some card club,

                         show's over.

               he opens fire, blowing away the wall of monitors and vcr's 
               recording the robbery. sparks and metal fly.
