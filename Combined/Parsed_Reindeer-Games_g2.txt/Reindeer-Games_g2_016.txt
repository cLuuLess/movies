               int. truck stop - day

               rudy and ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. coats still on. 
               big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.

               two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.

               she's watching him in silence.

                                     rudy
                         i like your coat.

               ashley says nothing. rudy looks at his own:

                                     rudy
                         this -- this is just something they 
                         gave me at the door. wasn't snowing 
                         when we signed up, y'know?

               ashley nods.

                                     rudy
                         how's your coffee?

               ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. 
               she lifts the cup, takes a sip. puts it down.

                                     ashley
                         good.

               rudy nods. silence again.

                                     rudy
                         gotta be ten degrees out there.

                                     ashley
                         radio said negative five.

                                     rudy
                         negative five?

                                     ashley
                         yeah.

                                     rudy
                         i don't think it's negative five.

                                     ashley
                         radio said.

               beat.

                                     rudy
                         wind chill. that's probably what 
                         they meant.

               ashley nods. rudy bites his lip.

                                     rudy
                         i was scared. scared you were gonna 
                         take one look at me and change your 
                         mind. scared i was walking into 
                         heartache. all those words... you 
                         put a picture in your mind of where 
                         they come from and when you see where 
                         maybe it's not the same as your 
                         picture.

               he trails off.

                                     ashley
                         i figured you walked outta there and 
                         saw me and walked right the other 
                         way --

                                     rudy
                         no, no --

                                     ashley
                         saw my outfit or something, my coat --

                                     rudy
                         no, hey, i like your coat --

                                     ashley
                         saw me --

                                     rudy
                         ashley, no. that was me, that's what 
                         i was scared of. i mean, be serious...  
                         i ain't exactly looking like mr.  
                         universe here.

                                     ashley
                         you are to me.

               rudy goes silent. whoa. ashley considers.

                                     ashley
                         thought you wrote you had a mustache.

                                     rudy
                         i can get another one going. y'know, 
                         hey, whatever you want me to --

                                     ashley
                         no, no, no. be like you want to be.

               another awkward pause. rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside 
               the coffee, puts it to his lips. it gives him a wide white 
               mustache. he stares straight-faced.

               ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.

                                     rudy
                         do that again.

                                     ashley
                         what.

                                     rudy
                         smile.

               ashley smiles again, blushing now.

                                     ashley
                         no --

                                     rudy
                         one more. smile. one more.

                                     ashley
                              (trying not to)
                         no, c'mon --

                                     rudy
                         i've been dreaming about that smile, 
                         ashley mercer. for a long time.

               they stare across the table, drifting into one another's 
               eyes.

                                     ashley
                         you're better than the picture in my 
                         mind, nick...
                              (softly)
                         you're real.

               outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow.

                                                              smash cut to:
