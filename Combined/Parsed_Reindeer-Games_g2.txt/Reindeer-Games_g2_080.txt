               int. first floor hallway - night

               rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell 
               on his way toward the "exit" sign posted above a door. he's 
               almost there, marching fast --

                                     rudy
                         here's my present to you, truck 
                         drivers --

               as the exit door opens

                                     merlin (o.s.)
                         where the hell's gabriel?

               -- and rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as 
               merlin and jumpy stride back inside.

                                     jumpy
                         with his girlfriend. making up for 
                         "nick" time. i'm going down to the 
                         bar, you want something?

                                     merlin
                         get me a brew. i'm gonna check on 
                         our convict.

               they separate, jumpy down the hall, merlin to the stairs --
