               ext. prison yard - day

               the two of them, nick and rudy, shivering by the fence. nick 
               absently whistles some "silver bells," then digs for a smoke.

                                     nick
                         what's the first thing, man? what's 
                         the first thing you're gonna do?

                                     rudy
                         haven't thought about it.

                                     nick
                         hell you haven't.

                                     rudy
                         get to thinking about it, it won't 
                         happen.

                                     nick
                         we walk outta here, we hit that road, 
                         what's the first thing you're gonna 
                         do.

                                     rudy
                         ain't there yet.

                                     nick
                         three days, man.

                                     rudy
                         not yet.

                                     nick
                         fuckin' christmas, man. fuckin, 
                         christmas on the outs.

               dozens of uniformed inmates wander the yard, stamping feet, 
               hands tucked away, breath frosting. nick tries to light his 
               cig, but the wind plays havoc. nick curses, tosses it.

                                     rudy
                         hot chocolate.

                                     nick
                         what?

                                     rudy
                         get a hot mug of chocolate.
                              (nods)
                         first thing i'm gonna do.

                                     nick
                              (smiles)
                         and a slice of pecan pie, right?

                                     rudy
                         and some pecan pie.

               nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the 
               prison's entrance road. longingly.

                                     nick
                         she's gonna be out there, man. right 
                         there. right there waiting.

                                     rudy
                         yeah.

                                     nick
                         gonna walk out of this shitstorm and 
                         right into her arms.

                                     rudy
                         yeah.

                                     nick
                         got us a motel out highway 5, bringing 
                         her own damn sheets, you read that 
                         part? silk damn sheets. lock ourselves 
                         in the whole week, drinking wine, 
                         taking baths, man, see if they got 
                         those room service steaks... anything 
                         i want to do. remember when she wrote 
                         that? anything i want...

                                     rudy
                         yeah. fuckin' christmas.

               nick grins. they stand there, shivering. it's freezing, but 
               the time they get outside is too precious to give up.

                                     rudy
                         all those pictures she's sent... 
                         y'know... you sure they're all of 
                         her, nick? you hear sometimes they 
                         don't send their real pictures. could 
                         be her cousin or something.

               nick studies him.

                                     nick
                         why you gotta say a thing like that.

                                     rudy
                         i'm just saying.

                                     nick
                         why you gotta. we were gonna give 
                         you a ride someplace, man. now i 
                         just don't know.

                                     rudy
                         i'm just talking.

                                     nick
                         fuck your hot chocolate, rudy.

               they trail off in silence. nick looks out at the prison road 
               again. a snowy wasteland.

                                     nick
                         i'm gonna marry this girl.
