               int. jack bangs' office - day

               close on stereo system

               and some scattered cassettes, labeled "big winners," "little 
               winners," and "medium cash." a hand pops the tape currently 
               in the system -- "big, big winners" and flips it over. presses 
               play. the sounds of jingling and jangling return.

               on full scene

               an office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass. 
               jack bangs, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit 
               and high blood pressure, paces his office. he's got the air 
               of a washed-up gameshow host, wink martindale, peter 
               tommarkin, one of those hacks. right now he's all caffeine.

               the tribal governors stare him down.

                         we understand the paiutes' casino

                         perhaps you have researched this, 
                         mr. bangs. is the snowfall on our 
                         side of the lake that much greater 
                         than the snowfall on theirs?
