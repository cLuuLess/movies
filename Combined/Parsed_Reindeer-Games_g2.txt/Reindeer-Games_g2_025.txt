               ext. motel - night

               ashley's chevy nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside 
               joint. there's an artificial (silver) christmas tree tied to 
               the roof.

               she and rudy climb out; she heads for the office:

                                     ashley
                         baby, i'm gonna go tell 'em not to 
                         disturb us for the rest of the year. 
                         i get back in that room, you better 
                         be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

                                     rudy
                         i'll see what i can do.

                                     ashley
                         no, lover. i'll see what you can do.

               she smiles, sashays sexily away. rudy watches her go, admiring 
               his good fortune. then pops the trunk, collects some of their 
               shopping score. gifts and goodies.

                                     rudy
                              (sings, sotto)
                         i have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-
                         pum-pum. no treasures for the king, 
                         pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...

               loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags 
               on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.
