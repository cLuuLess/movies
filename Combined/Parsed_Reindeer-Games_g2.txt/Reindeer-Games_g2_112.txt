               int. tomahawk - night

               rudy and jumpy sit at a blackjack table, beside the old timer.

               jovial ad libs as the waitress brings rudy's beer. rudy 
               doubles down, busts, and gets belligerent:

                         rudy
                    (to the old timer)
                 that was my card, pop! 
                 my card! you hit for 
                 my card!

                         old timer
                 i... sorry, mister...

                         rudy
                 that was my king!

                         old timer
                 well...sorry...

                                                       jumpy
                                                  (to the waitress)
                                               how are you tonight?

                                                       waitress

                                               santa?

                                                       jumpy
                                               jack and coke.

                                                       waitress
                                               want that jack and coke or jack and 
                                               pepsi? 

               behind them, gabriel slams through the casino doors.

                                     jumpy
                         woolworth's!

                                     gabriel

                                     jumpy

                         hand here!

               gabriel sidles to the table, claps rudy on the back.

                                     rudy
                              (re: old timer)
                         careful. watch out for this guy.

               they throw chips in. the waitress circles around:

                                     waitress
                         what can i get ya, santa?

                                     gabriel
                         american beer.

               the old timer hits and stays. rudy hits and busts:

                                     rudy
                         pop! that was my card!

                                     old timer
                         but... i had a five...

                                     rudy
                         you're hitting for my cards!
