               int. rudy's room - night

               close on sketch

               of a floor plan, a sheet of paper overlaid on gabriel's map 
               of the casino. a pencil draws a boxy room and labels it 
               "security video room." then an eraser wipes it out.

               widen to reveal rudy

               still cuffed to the bedframe, pulled close to a desk. he's 
               sitting, working on the security level map.

               the door opens; ashley enters, looking worried:

                                     ashley
                         he wants to see your map.

                                     rudy
                         i'm almost done.

                                     ashley
                         he says he wants it now.

                                     rudy
                         if he wanted a photographic memory, 
                         he shoulda kidnapped one. i'm working 
                         on it here.

               ashley walks over, puts her arms around his neck. whispers:

                                     ashley
                         how are we gonna do this, nick?

                                     rudy
                         you're the getaway girl. the money's 
                         gonna get to you eventually. gonna 
                         be my job to be the guy who walks 
                         outta there with it. but i can't do 
                         that without a gun. any luck talking 
                         to him?

                                     ashley
                         bullets or no bullets, he won't do 
                         it.

                                     rudy
                         is there any way you could get into 
                         his truck?

                                     ashley
                         no.

                                     rudy
                         we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...

               rudy studies his map, then quickly pencils in the "security 
               video room," in a totally different place than he drew it 
               before. hands the paper to her.

                                     rudy
                         here's the picasso. is he in his 
                         room?

                                     ashley
                         they all are. football's on.

                                     rudy
                              (nods, thinks)
                         keep 'em there for a little while.

               ashley takes the map, frowns. rudy kisses her gently.

                                     rudy
                         we're gonna get you out of detroit, 
                         ash. get you out of beauty and 
                         fragrances.
                              (smiles, then)
                         remember that. after all this is 
                         over, when you know me, when you 
                         really know me... remember it was 
                         me.

               she searches his eyes, not quite understanding. but smiles. 
               rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. ashley slips out.

               when she's gone, rudy stands and turns to the window. outside, 
               the blazer with the "ice fishermen do it all year long" bumper 
               sticker still sits parked.

               rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the 
               game room darts, flecked with blood.

               he gives it a solemn stare
