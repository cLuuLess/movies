               ext. parking lot - continuous

               rudy stamps feet, shivering in the cold, as merlin unlocks 
               his cuffs. gabriel reaches to help ashley out --

                                     ashley
                         get your goddamn hands off me --

               she edges toward rudy, then stops. a chill still there.

                                     gabriel
                         you got one hour.

                                     rudy
                         i'm gonna need some money.

               gabriel hands a bill.

                                     rudy
                         ten dollars? what do i do with ten 
                         dollars?

                                     gabriel
                         don't tip.

                                     rudy
                         monster. if we're working together 
                         here, we gotta be working together. 
                         i can't walk in there looking like 
                         the lone fucking ranger with ten 
                         bucks to throw down. you don't want 
                         me getting noticed, right? not getting 
                         noticed costs a guy at least a couple 
                         hundred.

               gabriel glares, turns to his crew. mutters, rubs his fingers 
               together. merlin, pug and jumpy reach for their wallets, 
               grumbling. gabriel takes a few twenties from each.

               rudy nods thanks as gabriel hands him the cash --

                                     gabriel
                              (threateningly)
                         don't. lose.

               rudy pockets the wad, hooks his elbow for ashley to slip her 
               arm through. grins with a drawl:

                                     rudy
                         you ready to gamble, darlin'?

               she regards him warily, but puts her arm in his.

                                     rudy
                              (to the boys)
                         y'all take care of my guitar.

               he tips his hat, and strides for the casino entrance. gabriel 
               and his truckers watch them go.

                                     merlin
                              (grumbles)
                         who's robbin' who here, gabriel...

                                     gabriel
                         get in there and watch 'em. watch 
                         their every fuckin' move.
