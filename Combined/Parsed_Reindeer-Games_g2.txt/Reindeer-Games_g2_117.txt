               int. tomahawk - on blackjack

               rudy bolts up suddenly, sends chips and his chair to the 
               carpet.

               points sternly at the old timer, slurring:

                                     rudy
                         switch seats with me.

                                     old timer
                         what? no...

                                     rudy
                         you're taking my money. switch seats 
                         with me. switch seats with me if 
                         you're not taking my money --

                                     old timer
                         i'm ninety-two years old --

                                     rudy
                         then get yourself another table!  
                         you're hitting santa's cards and 
                         you're taking santa's money!

                                     old timer
                         there is no other table --

                                     rudy
                         they'll open one!

               rudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his 
               might,

               overturning it, cards, chips, cash scattering --

               and everything happens at once

               two security guards at the door (?) rush for rudy --

               gabriel steps from the restroom, hall, moves toward the keypad 
               door to the security level --

               jumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage --

               rudy tackles the old timer, fists and false teeth flying, as 
               the guards arrive, trying to wrench him off the poor guy --

                                     rudy
                              (hard whisper)
                         stay down, pop! trust me, stay down!

               as gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door --

               in the security level

               the security boss grabs more men, while jack bangs merely 
               smiles at the sight. guards wrestling a drunken santa:

                                     security boss
                         help them down there! help them!

               in the casino

               three guards charge out of the keypad door --

               -- right past gabriel, who slips deftly inside --

               and up the private staircase

               -- opening his coat, pulling his assault rifle --

               gabriel

               right at the top of the stairs, right at the top of the 
               stairs...

               -- charging to the top, starting right and running smack 
               into a wall.

               he spins, sees the doorway's on his left --

               to a private hallway

               with three doors. gabriel stops at the first, grips his gun --

                                     gabriel
                         video room, video room --

               -- and swings open a closet bathroom. he frowns, confused. 
               jumps to the second door --

                                     gabriel
                         map said video room --

               -- and swings open a storage closet. gabriel grumbles, leaps 
               to the third door and flings it open,

                                     gabriel
                         map said goddamn video room!

               to reveal the main security area

               -- with two guards sitting at their posts, and jack bangs, 
               the security boss and the video guard in the doorway to the 
               video room. which is on the far opposite side of the space.

               as they turn to see the furious santa claus with the ak-47 --

                                     gabriel
                         what the fuck is going on??!!!

               -- as he sprays the ceiling with gunfire.
