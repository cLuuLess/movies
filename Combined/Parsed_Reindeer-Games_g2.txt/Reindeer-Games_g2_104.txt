               ext. lakeside rest area - dusk

               lake superior shimmers in the dying light. the rig's in the 
               empty rest area lot. on a nearby bank, four men in santa 
               claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic 
               tables, guns at their sides. staring out at the lake.

               rudy and ashley

               sit apart from the rest. rudy in a red suit, black boots, 
               cap in hand. ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.

                                     ashley
                         where should we go, nick? when we're 
                         gone from here... where should we 
                         go...

               the nova drives into the lot. pug gets out, carrying several 
               fast-food bags. hurrying to stay warm:

                                     pug (o.s.)
                         okay, who had the cheeseburger with 
                         bacon; what about a roast beef, i've 
                         got two roast beefs here --

                                     jumpy (o.s.)
                         cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --

                                     merlin (o.s.)
                         i got a bacon too; there another 
                         bacon in there?

                                     pug (o.s.)
                         i got a bacon for him and a bacon 
                         for me; there's four cheeseburgers 
                         and two roast beefs --

                                     merlin (o.s.)
                         somebody better give me something 
                         with some goddamn bacon --

               as they continue chow dispersal, rudy stares over the lake.

               distant. not even aware ashley's there.

                                     rudy
                         this time right now... dad's stacking 
                         wood out back, getting ready for 
                         tomorrow. little blaze in the 
                         fireplace. mom's setting out the 
                         good silver, hanging her cinammon 
                         sticks, up in the doorways. getting 
                         out her scratchy old records... 
                         singing along...

               rudy smiles to himself. he's got a faraway look.

                                     rudy
                         i don't know where you're going.  
                         but i'm going home.

                                     ashley
                         we go together, nick. wherever... we 
                         go together. remember?

                                     rudy
                         well. i'm going home.

               gabriel

               sits by the water, staring over the lake too. with a white 
               cotton santa beard resting on his chin. he unwraps his roast 
               beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a 
               savage bite.

               munches away, stares to rudy and ashley. she meets his eyes.  
               gabriel smiles. and looks again to the water.

               on full scene

               the snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. and the six figures 
               scattered, watching day turn to night...

                                                                    cut to:
