               int. knights inn restaurant - night

               a medieval-themed biergarten. a happy family of five sits at 
               a booth, singing along to "good king wencelas."

               in the booth beside, merlin and pug are holding court. 
               merlin's puffing smoke rings. pug watches dully, chewing:

                                     pug
                         knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten 
                         packs a day like you. his lungs got 
                         so black they couldn't find 'em with 
                         an x-ray.

                                     merlin
                         that right? shit. i used to run rigs 
                         for a guy loved your chaw there. 
                         shit rotted out his tongue, had to 
                         build him one outta silicon so the 
                         poor boy could talk. you ever see a 
                         motherfucker with a silicon fucking 
                         tongue?

               the happy family stops singing. pug considers, spits a wad.

                                     pug
                         hell. the guy from joliet, those 
                         black-ass lungs were the least of 
                         his problems. got so much smoke in 
                         him his lungs couldn't even hold it. 
                         got into his system, man. into his 
                         blood. coming out his ears, man, 
                         coming out his eyes. guy'd be walking 
                         the row, smoke'd be puffing out his 
                         skin.

               the happy family trade discomfited looks. merlin shrugs, 
               takes another drag.

                                     merlin
                         this trucker? met a girl in a bar 
                         one night, she didn't know his 
                         situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, 
                         they get to mackin' hot and heavy 
                         and the woman swallows it. his tongue. 
                         sucks it right down.

                                     pug
                         my guy would walk into a room, set 
                         off the goddamn sprinklers.

                                     merlin
                         his lips went next. you ever see 
                         some silicon-fucking-lips?

               the happy family flees their booth. pug and merlin glance 
               over. and grab their leftovers. rifling the grub:

                                     merlin
                              (with disgust)
                         vegetarians...

               behind them, gabriel and jumpy file into the biergarten, 
               leading rudy and ashley to the booth. meeting commenced.

               rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. 
               gabriel throws down the casino map:

                                     gabriel
                         start singing.

                                     rudy
                         i have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum-
                         pum-pum

                                     gabriel
                         sing it in pictures, nick.

               rudy takes the map, glances at ashley, and then takes charge. 
               for the first time, he's giving the orders:

                                     rudy
                         what you gotta worry about first is 
                         the guards. place doesn't look much 
                         richer than when i worked there, so 
                         let's figure you're gonna have to 
                         deal with ten of 'em. there'll be 
                         two on the floor, walking the room, 
                         that leaves eight up above. eyes in 
                         the sky. they see something up, 
                         they're the ones who'll hit the silent 
                         alarm and you're fucked.

                                     merlin
                         how do we take them out?

                                     rudy
                         you gotta get someone upstairs.

                                     merlin
                         how do we do that?

               rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:

                                     rudy
                         across from blackjack, there's a 
                         security doorway. keypad access.

                                     gabriel
                         what's the code?

                                     rudy
                         uh... they change it every month. i 
                         wouldn't know.
                              (beat)
                         if there's trouble on the floor, 
                         you'll get security coming through. 
                         what you gotta do, is get inside 
                         that doorway once they do. you gotta 
                         draw 'em out.

                                     pug
                         without having them hit the alarms.

                                     rudy
                         i got an idea on that one. once you're 
                         up there, you gotta hold those guards 
                         down till some backup can get there. 
                         there's a security camera room that 
                         videotapes everything. you've gotta 
                         destroy every last one of those tapes.

                                     merlin
                         what about the money?

                                     rudy
                         you lock down security, you move 
                         behind the cage. you hit the count 
                         room. there'll be a guy in there but 
                         he's got no guns; room's accessed by 
                         another code. cashiers'll know it. 
                         they'll have alarms.

                                     jumpy
                         what about the powwow safe?

                                     rudy
                         what?

                                     jumpy
                         the powwow safe. the secret safe.  
                         you said the manager's got a safe in 
                         his office where he hides skim money.

                                     rudy
                         oh. right. yeah. that's, uh upstairs. 
                         uh. here. powwow safe.

               his confident manner wavers. gabriel notices, narrows his 
               eyes. rudy quickly grabs the map again:

                                     rudy
                         so. you're gonna need a man through 
                         here, two men at the cage, one to 
                         cover the count. you're gonna need a 
                         lookout outside, a sweeper through 
                         the back, and a gun guarding the 
                         front.
                              (beat)
                         you need six.

                                     gabriel
                         we got five. putting ashley outside.

                                     rudy
                         you need six.

               gabriel eyes him darkly.

                                     gabriel
                         no.

                                     rudy
                         you go in with five, you're either 
                         leaving an alarm free or an exit 
                         free. someone hits an alarm, you're 
                         fucked. someone gets to a phone, 
                         gets outside, 'cross the street, 
                         whatever, you're fucked. you need 
                         six.
                              (nods)
                         six is me.

                                     gabriel
                         no.

                                     rudy
                         you guys get caught, i go away for 
                         good. i got an interest in making 
                         sure you don't. you need a sixth man 
                         covering an exit. what're you gonna 
                         do about it.

                                     ashley
                         yeah. what're you gonna do about it.

               she puts an arm around rudy, smiles. that's her man.

                                     gabriel
                         i want a map of that security level.  
                         every room, every guard, every thing.

                                     rudy
                         six men means six guns.

                                     gabriel
                         no way.

                                     rudy
                         i'm no threat without a gun.

                                     gabriel
                         no, you're not.

                                     rudy
                         there'll be people in that casino.  
                         i can't keep them from leaving if i 
                         don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, 
                         monster... but i gotta be a threat.

                                     ashley
                         what's the matter, gabriel? this is 
                         what you wanted him for, isn't it?

               gabriel's eyes don't leave rudy's.

                                     gabriel
                         no gun.

                                     rudy
                         well. what you guys have to plan 
                         out, then... is how you're going to 
                         get to that cage and that security 
                         level before anybody realizes 
                         anything's wrong. running in with 
                         ski masks and bullets flying ain't 
                         gonna do it.

                                     gabriel
                         that part, nick... was planned out 
                         the day i read your letters.

                                     rudy
                         what. we all gonna dress up like 
                         cowboys?

                                     gabriel
                         not cowboys, nick. not cowboys.

               gabriel smiles.

                                     gabriel
                         not on christmas eve.
