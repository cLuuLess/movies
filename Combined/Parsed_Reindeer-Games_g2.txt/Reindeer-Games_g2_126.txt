               ext. parking lot - night

               rudy ambles out into the snowy night. the lot is quiet. he 
               takes a few wary steps toward the road --

               -- and hears a click. he turns to see ashley standing behind 
               him, with a gun. shaking her pretty head.

                                     ashley
                         your turn.

               rudy shuts his eyes for the end.
