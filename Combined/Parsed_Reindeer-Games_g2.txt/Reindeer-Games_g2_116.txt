               int. security level

               the security boss returns upstairs, beside jack bangs, who's 
               watching the video monitors. on one screen, a parking lot 
               cam shows merlin and pug approaching:

                                     video guard
                         there's two more coming.

                                     jack bangs
                         hell, there we go. that's the spirit.

               he drunkenly clinks his battle to the security boss, wassail. 
               the boss frowns.

                                     security boss
                         jack? is there a union for department 
                         store santas?
