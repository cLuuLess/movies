               int. interstate motel room - day

               and rudy and ashley slam inside, kissing passionately, limbs 
               intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. rudy kicks the 
               door closed. mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair.

               they collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling 
               onto the lumpy bed. rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater 
               and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on, 
               as ashley's lips explore his neck and body. writhing and 
               wrestling and rolling off the bed. bang.
