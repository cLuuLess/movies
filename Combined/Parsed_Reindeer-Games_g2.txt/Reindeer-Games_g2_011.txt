               int. mess hall - tables - day

               rudy and nick sit at a cafeteria table. beside rudy is a 
               frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, zook. zook sits alone, talks 
               to no one, always has the shakes.

                                     nick
                         so maybe after our week beneath the 
                         sheets, we'll head down to motor 
                         city for new year's. she says her 
                         roommate's skipping town for a few 
                         days, have the place to ourselves.  
                         remember how her brother's a truck 
                         driver down there? i'm thinking he 
                         might be able to help get me some 
                         work.

                                     rudy
                         what, working security?

                                     nick
                         no, i'm through with that shit. 
                         ashley's right. gotta start doing 
                         something i got a stake in. get a 
                         business going.

                                     rudy
                         i don't know, i've seen the business 
                         world.

                                     nick
                         hotwiring cars, rudy, does not qualify 
                         as a small business. chop shop 
                         consultant; doesn't work on a resume.

               rudy shrugs. he checks across the room, on the whereabouts 
               of the alamo. the big indian has his back turned.

                                     nick
                         ashley's talking about maybe we can 
                         start something up together...

               next to rudy, zook has stopped eating. he is still as stone, 
               staring at his tray.

                                     nick
                         whatsa matter, zook?

               they both watch zook put down his utensils and reach into 
               his red-and-green jello with his bare hand.

                                     rudy
                         the hell you doing, zookerman?

               gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a 
               large black cockroach out. zook's shaking.

                                     nick
                         just a roach, zook.

                                     rudy
                         good for you. protein.

                                     zook
                         monsters in the gelatin...

                                     nick
                         it's a roach, guy --

                                     zook
                         there are monsters...
                              (voice rising)
                         ...in the gelatin...

                                     nick
                         oh, man --

               zook stands up, holding jello aloft:

                                     zook
                         there are monsters in the gelatin!

                                     nick
                              (shakes his head)
                         fuckin, zookerman --

                                     zook
                         there are monsters! in the gelatin!  
                         there are monsters! in the gelatin!

               a grumbling murmur sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates 
               sift through their jello, searching for --

                                     distant inmate
                         sonofabitch!

               he pulls something bug-like out of his dessert, holds it 
               aloft, and then hurls it at the cafeteria line. a staffer 
               ducks away. the inmates laugh and suddenly they're all on 
               their feet --

                                     zook
                         there are monsters! in the gelatin!

               -- grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria 
               line. inmates get errantly splashed, and respond by wheeling 
               on their fellow inmates -- red and green globs flying to and 
               fro!

                                     guards
                         sit down! sit the fuck back down!

               as guards immediately rush in to restore order --

                                     nick
                         rudy, don't move --

                                     rudy
                         two days, we got two days! don't do 
                         nothing. don't touch nothing --

               an inmate at the end of their table picks up their table and 
               overturns it, sending food flying. rudy and nick stand back, 
               hands raised in surrender. jello hits rudy in the face.

                                     nick
                         don't move, rudy!

                                     rudy
                         standing right here, man!

               zook is still shouting until a guard clubs him senseless 
               with a blackjack. whistles are blowing. guards scream for 
               order.

                                     nick
                              (as a guard eyes them)
                         ate the jello, jello was fine!

               the guard leaves them alone, runs on. the melee's still out 
               of control. as rudy turns --

               -- and suddenly sees the alamo charging across the room, 
               with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! five feet 
               away!

                                     nick
                         rudy, look out!

               nick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way --

               -- and the alamo's shank plunges deep into nick's stomach 
               burying between his ribs. blood splashes. nick slumps.

                                     rudy
                         nick!

               the alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious yell, pushes 
               nick to the floor and spins on rudy! rudy blocks with a chair, 
               stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as the alamo roars 
               over him for the kill --

               -- and two guards tackle the big indian out of nowhere! 
               knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. it 
               takes another three guards to keep the alamo down.

               rudy scrambles across the floor. nick's on his back, blood 
               pumping freely from his gut --

                                     rudy
                         guard! guard!

                                     nick
                              (in shock)
                         alamo...

                                     rudy
                         guard!!!

               no one's helping, the guards nearby all subduing the alamo. 
               nick grabs rudy's shirt, gasping to speak --

                                     nick
                         jesus, rudy --

                                     rudy

                                     nick
                         oh, fuck, rudy... oh jesus...

                                     rudy

                                     rudy

                                     nick
                              (choking)
                         tell her... i'll be there ...

                                     rudy
                         you're gonna be there! we're getting 
                         outta here! take it!

                                     nick
                         tell ashley... i...

                                     rudy
                         you tell her!

                                     nick
                         ...be with her...

               blood spills out nick's mouth. his eyes go vacant.

                                     rudy
                         no!!!

                                     nick
                         ...for christmas...

                                     rudy
                         nick!!!

               and rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. a trio of guards 
               descend, grabbing nick's body as his life fades away. dragging 
               his figure out of the melee. whistles are blowing.

                                     guards
                         get him out of here! lock down!

                                     rudy
                         nick!!!

               rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the 
               skull for his trouble. he hits the jello-covered floor.

               and the world goes dark.
