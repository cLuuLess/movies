               ext. parking lot - night

               more snow falling. a handful of cars in the lot. a third 
               body in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of 
               an old pontiac. his head is not visible, having smashed 
               through the windshield. his suit is charred and blackened.

               a halo of broken glass outlines him. his black boots hang 
               off the front bumper. the parking lot is silent.
