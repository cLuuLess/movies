               int. jack bangs' office - night

               gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. 
               the taped jingle of slots still plays.

               poor jack bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. blood 
               runs down his face and shark suit. tears and shock:

                                     jack bangs
                         i can't go back to vegas... i can't... 
                         go back...

                                     jumpy (o.s.)
                         what the hell is with this place?  
                         thought the video room was back there --

               merlin and jumpy lead rudy in. ashley follows. they carry 
               bulging money sacks. gabriel stares rudy down.

                                     gabriel
                         i told you not to fuck us with that 
                         map, nick. i told you not to, and 
                         you did. how am i s'posed to keep my 
                         promises now?
                              (ashley joins him)
                         how's she s'posed to keep hers?

               he kisses her hard. sloppy. grins.

               then points to jack bangs:

                                     gabriel
                         he won't tell us where it is. the 
                         powwow safe.

                                     jack bangs
                         i don't know... what you're...

               gabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle. crack.

                                     gabriel
                         the powwow safe! where is the powwow 
                         safe!

                                     jack bangs
                         what... powwow...

                                     gabriel
                         the powwow safe where you steal your 
                         money! where you cheat your indians!

                                     jack bangs
                         i don't steal any --

               gabriel cracks him again. and again. rudy winces. gabriel 
               grabs rudy, pulls him over.

                                     gabriel
                         we know about the powwow safe! we 
                         know it's in here! we know how you 
                         work! because we know who's worked 
                         for you!
                              (smiles)
                         remember a guy named nick mason!?  a 
                         security guard named nick mason!?

               gabriel pushes rudy's head toward the desk. jack bangs, 
               drooling blood, eyes swollen, turns his face to see.

                                     jack bangs
                         nick... mason... ?

               jack bangs stares at rudy. rudy stares back.

                                     jack bangs
                         ...so where is he?

                                     gabriel
                              (laughs, mocking)
                         where is he?! where is he?!

                                     jack bangs
                         he's not nick mason...

               the smile fades from gabriel's face.

                                     jack bangs
                         nick mason... worked for me two years 
                         ago. this man...
                              (a spark of recognition)
                         ...he's some cowboy...

               gabriel grabs rudy, slams him against a wall. he glares at 
               ashley for answers. she stares in disbelief.

               rudy meets her eyes.

                                     rudy
                         fucked the wrong guy, ashley.
                              (shrugs)
                         story of your life.

               back to gabriel:

                                     rudy
                         i did time with nick mason, monster.  
                         told you that from the start.

               ashley's putting it all together...

                                     ashley
                         you... you... you --

                                     rudy
                         we still gonna spend christmas 
                         together?

               ashley charges him. gabriel stops her; merlin and jumpy help 
               hold her back. gabriel spins on rudy with his rifle:

                                     gabriel
                         you are lucky, convict. you're 
                         spending christmas with the birthday 
                         boy himself --

                                     rudy
                         hey! hey! there is a powwow safe!

               gabriel hesitates. doesn't fire.

                                     rudy
                         i did time with nick mason, remember?  
                         i knew he worked here, didn't i!?  
                         well, some shit he told me!

               rudy steels himself for the shot. it still doesn't come.

                                     rudy
                         nick told me his manager kept a safe 
                         in his office, his stealing safe. 
                         his powwow safe. i swear, please...  
                         nick told me.
                              (looks to jack bangs)
                         behind the liquor cabinet.

               jack bangs dully meets rudy's eyes.

               gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves. 
               they split in the middle. and there is a combination safe 
               mounted in the back. gabriel turns to jack bangs:

                                     gabriel
                         open it.

               he pulls him off the desk. jack bangs wavers, struggling. he 
               looks at gabriel. then at rudy.

                                     jack bangs
                         i can't go back to vegas...

                                     gabriel
                         open it!!!

               jack bangs steps to the safe. spins the lock. spins back. 
               spins forward. click. jack bangs looks at rudy.

                                     rudy
                              (nods)
                         pow. wow.

               and jack bangs opens it --

               -- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the 
               safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of weapons that lies 
               inside, jack bangs already has an uzi in hand --

                                     jack bangs
                         veeeeggggaaaassss!!!

               bullets as he turns back to the room --

               -- sending gabriel, ashley, and merlin diving for the floor! 
               jumpy can't get down, as bullets riddle him dead --

               -- and blow out the smoked windows overlooking the casino --

               jack bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --

               -- blowing out the windows to the parking lot, shattering 
               the liquor, sending rudy scrambling under his desk --

                                     jack bangs
                         i can't! go back! i can't! go back! 
                         i can't! go back!

                                     gabriel
                         go!!!

               he and ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out 
               with two of the money sacks --

               to the casino floor

               -- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --

               jack bangs keeps firing, into the casino, shredding the tables 
               but missing gabriel and ashley -- as he jumps right after 
               them.

               back in bangs' office

               merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking 
               for rudy --

               -- just as rudy slams into him. merlin's shot hits the 
               ceiling.

               the two of them crash down, wrestling and rolling toward the 
               parking lot window. two guns spill to the floor. rudy grabs 
               one, just as merlin kicks out, leaping up --

               -- and freezes, seeing rudy's got a pistol on him.

               before merlin can make a move, rudy fires --

               -- and a thin stream of water shoots out. leaving a stain on 
               his shirt. it's the water pistol. rudy stares blankly.

               as merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off 
               the floor. rudy's dead to rights.

                                     merlin
                         hell. i'm gonna take pleasure in 
                         this...

               with the gun on rudy, merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.

               pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --

               -- and hesitates. sniffing the air. looking down.

               at the stain on his shirt. his lighter still lit --

                                     rudy
                         me too.

               -- and rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching 
               merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a arc of fire! 
               he's filled alcohol in the gun!

               flaming liquor shoots into merlin's face and eyes. he drops 
               the handgun. rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading 
               the fire down his neck and chest. merlin howls wildly --

               -- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --

               out the parking lot window

               -- and crashing down on the hood of a pontiac, head through 
               the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. flames flickering.

                                     rudy
                         smoke 'em if you got 'em.

               in the casino

               gabriel and ashley have scrambled to the nova, tumbling in 
               with the money sacks. jack bangs gets up, stalking toward 
               them, still firing and babbling.

               gabriel fires back, hitting bangs in the chest. he staggers, 
               but stays upright. his bullets riddle the car, shattering 
               the windshield, but gabriel and ashley keep their heads down, 
               slamming it into reverse --

               -- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, 
               into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.

               jack bangs stops shooting.

               he staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, 
               gun still raised.

               rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. 
               he puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in bangs, 
               face. the uzi drops to the ground.

               a silence. even the slots have stopped.

                                     rudy
                         i'm sorry.

               jack bangs stares blankly. surveys the wreckage of his poor 
               man's empire. and gives a small shrug.

                                     jack bangs
                         that's why they call it gambling.

               he slumps against the bar and hits the floor. dead.
