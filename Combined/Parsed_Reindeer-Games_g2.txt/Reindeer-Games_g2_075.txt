               int. rudys room - moments l&ter - night

               rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. he 
               tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped 
               end, furthest-from the tip. four protruding metal edges.

               he finds the phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to 
               work the dart-end into the grooves. it scrapes and jags, but 
               with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.

               the screw starts spiraling out.

               angle on bedframe

               as two metal pieces split apart, and rudy wriggles his ankle 
               handcuff off the frame.

               angle on closet

               as rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips 
               the paper off, untwisting the wire.

               angle on room's window

               as rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.
