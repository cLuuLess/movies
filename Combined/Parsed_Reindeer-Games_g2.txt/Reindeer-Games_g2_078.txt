               ext. parking lot

               rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. 
               and then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing

               merlin and jumpy

               stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way 
               toward the nova. voices too low to hear.

               on scene

               rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.  
               merlin and jumpy walk right by him.

               rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, 
               heading away from his room's window. his window. rudy glances 
               back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem 
               to. they stand at the nova, talking.

               rudy shivers, waiting. they're not leaving. when their backs 
               turn, rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. 
               he slips around the corner, out of sight.

               around the side of the hotel

               rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving 
               toward a side entry --

               -- when he stops, hearing a woman's laughter.

               above his head are a row of windows. reflections of rippling 
               water on the ceiling inside. it's the hotel pool behind this 
               wall.

               sounds of splashes. murmured voices.

               rudy stands absolutely still. his breaths stop frosting. 
               because his breathing has stopped.
