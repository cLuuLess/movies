               int. j.c. penney's department store - day

               teddy bears with nightcaps, green bows, red ribbons. ashley's 
               tearing through men's clothing racks, all love and confidence.

               rudy's got a bunch of purchase bags weighing him down:

                                     ashley
                         you need a coat!

                                     rudy
                         ash, you've gotten me enough --

                                     ashley
                         no boyfriend of mine is going to 
                         walk around in negative-five degree 
                         wind chill without a goddamn good-
                         looking coat!

               she pulls out a hellacious black leather fringe number.

                                     rudy
                         baby, c'mon, all this stuff... i 
                         haven't gotten you anything --

                                     ashley
                         you got out, nick. you're here.  
                         you're my christmas.

               she puts the jacket against his chest, smiling. rudy sighs.

                                     rudy
                         it's two hundred dollars, ash --

               she whips a penney's card from her purse, grins wickedly:

                                     ashley
                         you forget where i work?

                                     rudy
                              (beat)
                         beauty and fragrances.

                                     ashley
                         fifty percent off, motherfucker. ho 
                         ho ho.

               she runs off with the jacket. rudy turns to a dressing mirror, 
               left to stare at his reflection. an ex-con in rags, with a 
               half-dozen holiday shopping bags. to himself:

                                     rudy
                         just for the holidays, nick. then 
                         we'll tell her. we'll let her... 
                         have her holidays...

               rudy nods till he convinces himself. can't help but smile.
