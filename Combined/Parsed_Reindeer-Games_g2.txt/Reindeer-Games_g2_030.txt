               ext. rest stop/int. gabriel's rig - continuous

               the rig all alone at a snowy rest area. gabriel, merlin and 
               jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. gabriel surveys, 
               then lifts a piece of paper:

                                     gabriel
                         "my sweet, sexy ashy-lashy, i have 
                         been dreaming of you constantly, and 
                         knowing you are out there makes these 
                         walls not seem so close or so strong 
                         or so cold..."
                              (to merlin/jumpy)
                         women live for this stuff.
                              (reads on)
                         dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming 
                         'bout your those, gettin' x-rated on 
                         me here, nicky... where are we... 
                         oh, right, other side...
                              (turns paper over)
                         "someday i'm gonna take you up by 
                         lake s. before i went in, before 
                         goddamn millie, 'fore i had my 
                         situation, i used to work up at this 
                         casino, working security. used to 
                         watch for people stealing chips, 
                         counting cards, getting piss-drunk, 
                         that kinda shit. indian place, they 
                         hired this reject outta vegas to run 
                         it, got about as much business sense 
                         as a buffalo patty. anyways, it's a 
                         fun place to run some numbers and 
                         play."

               gabriel puts the letter down.

                                     gabriel
                         you're a good writer, nick. i give 
                         this writing an a-plus.

                                     rudy
                         i never worked at no casino.

                                     ashley
                              (hopeless)
                         nick...

               rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:

                                     rudy
                         that's the guy i was in with, i did 
                         my last ten months with him. he rode 
                         a two-year bit for manslaughter -- 
                         split a guy's skull open at a bar 
                         for harassing his girl. that's nick 
                         mason. he worked at that casino. 
                         he's the one who wrote her letters.  
                         me, i'm a damn mechanic, my last job 
                         was a quickie lube, i did five for 
                         lifting cars. i don't know shit about 
                         blackjack, i don't know shit about 
                         indians. i'm not him.

               gabriel stares at him. then crumples the letter.

                                     gabriel
                         bury this guy.

               merlin and jumpy grab rudy and throw him from the truck. he 
               hits the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.

                                     ashley
                         gabriel, you promised!

                                     gabriel
                         i promised that when he helped us, 
                         we'd be gone! when he helped us!  
                         loverboy don't want to play!

               merlin and jumpy drop to the snow, picking rudy up.

                                     ashley
                         you promised me!

                                     gabriel
                         and you promised me you'd get your 
                         sweetheart to help!

               rudy meets eyes with ashley. she's caught.

                                     gabriel
                         he'd rather die than be with you, 
                         he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend 
                         anyway.
                              (to merlin/jumpy)
                         bury him all over the place.

                                     ashley
                         no!

               she charges at her brother. gabriel grabs her, spins her 
               into control and punches her in the jaw. she goes flying out 
               of the truck. hits the ground hard. in shock.

               merlin and jumpy march rudy across the lot. a stand of dark 
               and snowy woods ahead...

                                     merlin
                         beats prison, i guess.

                                     ashley (o.s.)
                         nick!!! nick!!! nooooo!!!

               rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. jumpy loads a 
               handgun, as he muses for the very first time:

                                     jumpy
                         the problem with prison... is that 
                         it is founded on the fundamentally 
                         flawed perception of rehabilitation 
                         through punishment. a society can't 
                         hope to create a "changed man" by 
                         surrounding him with the worst in 
                         his fellow man; what it 
                         "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction 
                         that if he can survive the inhumanity 
                         of prison, what then, can he not 
                         withstand? he has seen man's darkest 
                         soul and kept his sight: what is 
                         left for such a man? what faith? 
                         what fear?

               at the woods' edge, jumpy gives the gun to merlin --

                                     jumpy
                         don't get no blood on my boots --

               the gun goes to rudy's head. a bullet fills the chamber. 
               ashley screams. rudy shuts his eyes tight and --

                                     rudy
                         what do you want to know!

               merlin and jumpy stop. ashley stops screaming. gabriel turns.

                                     rudy
                         about the tomahawk! what the hell do 
                         you want to know!

               his guards look to gabriel. rudy nods, sweating.

                                     rudy
                         i spend six months writing poetry 
                         and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. 
                         thanks for the stamps, ash. you want 
                         me, you got me. whaddya want to know.

               ashley gasps relief. gabriel smiles.

                                     gabriel
                         everything.

               merlin and jumpy march rudy back. still on the ground:

                                     ashley
                         i love you... nick, i love you...

               rudy won't meet her eyes.

                                     gabriel
                         hey. she says she loves you, nick.

                                     rudy
                         she says a lot of things.

                                     gabriel
                         she's getting you to help us... 'cause 
                         she knows if you don't, you're dead. 
                         you just tell us what we need to 
                         know, you two live happily ever after.  
                         my sister loves you, motherfucker, 
                         and i ain't gonna have you break her 
                         heart.

                                     rudy
                         wish i had a brother like you.

                                     gabriel
                         a girl says she loves you, you say 
                         something.

               rudy looks at ashley. her eyes plead forgiveness.

                                     rudy
                         i had better sex in prison.

                                     gabriel
                         heyyy. be nice, convict. we're gonna 
                         be working together here.
                              (to his boys)
                         get him back in the rig.

               merlin and jumpy wrench rudy backward. ashley reaches out to 
               him, starts to speak. he looks right through her. she goes 
               silent, casts her eyes to the snow.

                                     pug (o.s.)
                         he's not the guy, monster.

               everyone looks to the truck. weasel-faced pug has sidled 
               next to gabriel. spits some chaw.

               it hits merlin's boots. merlin growls.

                                     pug
                         whole time you were driving, he was 
                         telling her he's not the guy, he's 
                         not the guy. i know why he'd tell us 
                         he's not the guy. why's he telling 
                         her he's not the guy? what if he's 
                         not the guy?

               gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. walks to rudy:

                                     gabriel
                         the man who wrote those letters loved 
                         ashley, boys. he lived for her love.
                              (nods)
                         let's see him live for love.

               gabriel puts a gun under rudy's chin. rudy flinches.

                                     gabriel
                         where's she work?

                                     rudy
                         what?

                                     gabriel
                              (forces gun harder)
                         wrote you a hundred letters, didn't 
                         she? where's she work?

                                     rudy
                         j.c. penney. beauty and fragrances.

                                     gabriel
                         what's her middle name?

                                     rudy
                              (thinking hard)
                         samantha.

                                     gabriel
                         what'd they call her in high school?

                                     rudy
                         bam bam.

                                     gabriel
                         what'd they call her in college?

                                     rudy
                         what college.

                                     gabriel
                         where'd she drop her cherry?

                                     ashley
                         gabriel!

                                     rudy
                         canada.

                                     gabriel
                         be more specific.

                                     rudy
                         a station wagon in canada.

                                     gabriel
                         what's her greatest fear?

                                     rudy
                         her brother.

                                     gabriel
                         wrong, nick. it's drowning.

                                     rudy
                         no. it's her brother.

               rudy stares him down. gabriel shrugs.

                                     gabriel
                         that's love.

               he puts the gun away. ashley regains her breath.

                                     gabriel
                         let's get back on the road. it's 
                         time to start talking, nick. time to 
                         start telling tales --

                                     rudy
                         nick don't talk till nick gets 
                         something.

               gabriel gives a challenging stare. rudy stares right back.

               it's a showdown.

                                     rudy
                         hot. chocolate.

               the trucker slowly smiles. his crew chuckles.
