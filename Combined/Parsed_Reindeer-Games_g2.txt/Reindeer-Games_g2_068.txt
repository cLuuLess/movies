               int. knights inn game room - day

               gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless. 
               bullseye.

               merlin and jumpy haul rudy in. he collapses at gabriel's 
               feet, unable to stand. still trembling.

               a couple kids scamper into the doorway --

                                     merlin
                         game room's closed.

               -- and merlin slams the door in their face. gabriel hurls 
               another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board.

                                     gabriel
                         a for effort, nick, honestly, a for 
                         effort and an honorary degree. i'm 
                         surprised you never escaped from the 
                         mountain.

                                     rudy
                              (teeth chattering)
                         ...never... tried...

                                     gabriel
                         nick, here's what we're gonna do. in 
                         the spirit of the season, i'm going 
                         to give you a chance. i understand 
                         you're unhappy. right outta the 
                         lockup, here against your will, it's 
                         the holidays and there's reruns on 
                         tv.
                              (beat)
                         so we're gonna have a contest.

               gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.

                                     gabriel
                         we're each going to get one of these. 
                         whichever one of us hits closer to 
                         the bullseye... gets what he wants.
                              (beat)
                         you land closer, you get ashley.  
                         and you guys get to go free. i land 
                         closer... and we start getting your 
                         help.

               he lifts rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. rudy's 
               fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. gabriel has to 
               wedge it in.

                                     gabriel
                         may the best sportsman win.

               gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his 
               dart. it thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.

                                     gabriel
                         damn.

               he steps aside for rudy. rudy struggles to raise his hand, 
               trembling badly. he focuses on the board, teeth chattering, 
               tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --

               -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. he brings his 
               icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. and the dart finally 
               tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.

               gabriel smiles, steps close.

                                     gabriel
                         got something to say to me, nick?

                                     rudy
                         ...ttt..tt... two out of three?

               gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. rudy crashes 
               into a chair, flanked by video games.

                                     gabriel
                         what'd you tell that casino manager?

                                     rudy
                         nnn... nothing...

                                     gabriel
                         you were talking to him! what'd you 
                         tell him!?

                                     rudy
                         nothing... i promise-nothing...

                                     gabriel
                         maybe something about a robbery?

                                     rudy
                         no!

               gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and 
               wheels. he whistles a dart at rudy's head. it smacks the 
               wall beside his ear.

               he whistles another. it trunks right above his head. a third 
               hits the wall by his chin.

                                     rudy
                         he thought i was some gambler... he 
                         didn't know me... he didn't recognize 
                         me!

                                     gabriel
                         i been driving rigs a long time, 
                         nick. four, five million miles of 
                         road. worked for people who wouldn't 
                         keep me on less i was driving fifteen 
                         hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, 
                         i needed rest, shit, they'll hire 
                         someone else...

               gabriel flings another dart. just misses rudy's other ear.

                                     gabriel
                         ...dispatcher's screaming for me to 
                         haul ass, he's got a load on the 
                         runback for me. shipper's making me 
                         wait for the pickup, receiver's 
                         bitching 'bout the count...

               another dart nails the wall, right through rudy's hair.

                                     gabriel
                         ...got the cops at the bottom of 
                         every mountain, got the dot at the 
                         top. and every day, every day, i see 
                         all those faces in their little airbag 
                         hot wheels, moms and pops and jam-
                         faced kiddies, giving me that look 
                         to go to hell and get off their happy 
                         goddamn highway. hey. they don't 
                         gotta get two thousand miles by 
                         sundown, or the gang don't eat come 
                         sunrise.

               gabriel strides to rudy, sitting stock-still, his head ringed 
               by darts. stares him down.

                                     gabriel
                         it's time for me... to be working 
                         for me. i want mine, nick. and i 
                         need you.
                              (frightening calm)
                         did you tell your manager there's 
                         gonna be a robbery?

                                     rudy
                         no, gabriel... no...

               gabriel pulls the darts free. backs away again.

                                     rudy
                         ...he... he asked me... how i'd heard 
                         about his place... he didn't know it 
                         was me...

               gabriel raises a dart to throw

                                     rudy
                         i promise you he didn't know it was 
                         me!

               -- and then lowers it. believing he's gotten a reprieve, 
               rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.

                                     rudy
                         man, monster... just... just don't 
                         start trying to hit me...

                                     gabriel
                         nick. i been trying to hit you.

               gabriel rears back and whistles another dart. it plugs into 
               rudy's chest. rudy screams. gabriel fires another, skewering 
               him in the ribs. then a third, fourth and fifth.

               rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. five 
               darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering 
               and spreading rivulets of blood.

                                     gabriel
                         maybe that'll help sharpen your 
                         memory.

               gabriel stalks close.

                                     gabriel
                         tonight we're gonna take another 
                         look at that map. and this time you're 
                         gonna tell me what i need to know.
