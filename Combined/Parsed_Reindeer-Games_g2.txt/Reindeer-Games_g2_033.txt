               int. truck stop - moments later

               a couple leaves the booth behind gabriel's crew. pug and 
               merlin reach over, steal their leftovers and dig in. ashley 
               fidgets.

               jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside:

                                     jumpy
                         i've read where the retail industry 
                         does fifty percent of its business 
                         between december 1st and december 
                         25th. half the year's business, in 
                         one month's time. it seems to me an 
                         intelligent society would legislate 
                         a second such gift-giving holiday, 
                         create, say, a christmas two -- late 
                         may, early june -- to further 
                         stimulate growth and prosperity. for 
                         who would protest such a holiday? 
                         taking the fifty percent model, a 
                         christmas two would grow this 
                         country's annual per capita income 
                         by close to one-third.

               everyone stares at jumpy.

                                     gabriel
                         christmas two.

               the indian nods. gabriel shakes his head.

                                     gabriel
                         ever since you started night school, 
                         you been givin, me headaches, jumpy.  
                         headaches.
                              (to merlin/pug)
                         go see what's taking him.
