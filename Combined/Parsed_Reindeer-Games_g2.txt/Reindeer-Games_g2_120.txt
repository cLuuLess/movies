               ext. parking lot

               ashley waits in the nova, checking her watch. behind her a 
               red wrangler rolls in and parks. a fire chief and his deputy, 
               just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.

               ashley sinks low, panicked. presses her horn. the firemen 
               spin around but don't see her. they shrug. keep walking.
