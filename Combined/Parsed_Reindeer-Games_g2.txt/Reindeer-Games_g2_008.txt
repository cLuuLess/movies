               int. prison cell - day

               rudy lies in his bunk, staring at the same paper snowflakes.

                                     nick (o.s.)
                         hey, hey, listen here. "i've made my 
                         list and i've checked it twice, and 
                         as long as you're naughty, it's gonna 
                         be nice. these cold winter weeks 
                         have been killing me, nick, as i lie 
                         here alone. it's not enough to have 
                         your warmth in my heart anymore; i 
                         need your warmth next to me. work at 
                         penney's has been busy because it's 
                         christmas and that's when we do almost 
                         half of our business for the whole 
                         year -- ", okay, whatever, whatever --
                              (skipping on)
                         " -- my manager's still mad at me 
                         for asking for the whole week off," 
                         whatever, whatever --
                              (smiles)
                         here we go. "and all that gets me 
                         through the day is to close my eyes 
                         and imagine holding you, and kissing 
                         you, and touching you, and tasting 
                         you everywhere because i know at 
                         that moment, i'll feel i've found 
                         the reason for my whole entire life."

               rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.

                                     rudy
                         for twenty-five, she sounds pretty 
                         mature.

                                     nick
                         yeah. you grow up in detroit, you 
                         get matured real quick.

               nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, 
               reading sheets of pink stationery. with a new photo: of the 
               same girl, in a bikini by a lake. vamping a childish pose.

                                     nick
                         sure as hell don't make me miss millie 
                         bobek. guess i owe millie, though. 
                         if i hadn't been rollin, her, i woulda 
                         never ended up here. and i woulda 
                         never met ashley.
                              (studies photo)
                         that's the world for ya.

               nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling 
               at the latest letter.

                                     rudy
                         what if she sees you, man, sees what 
                         you look like... and it's not there.  
                         you just don't do it for her.

                                     nick
                         me and her got a connection.
                              (hands page to him)
                         read this part. read the part about 
                         stuffing her stocking.

               nick drops the page on his stomach. rudy sighs, picks it up, 
               brings it to his nose.

                                     rudy
                         she's using a new perfume.

                                     nick
                         no, i think that's just oranges. she 
                         writes here she's eating oranges.

                                     rudy
                         oh.

                                     nick
                         shoulda written to that magazine, 
                         rudy. i'm gonna walk outta here, 
                         walk right into a relationship. not 
                         some one-nighter, man... a 
                         relationship. you? you're gonna walk 
                         outta here with bus fare. searching 
                         for the drunkest skirt in the room.

                                     rudy
                         mornin', gorgeous. more egg nog?

                                     nick
                         shoulda written, rudy...

               nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo 
               among his collage of pictures. admiring his pen pal:

                                     nick
                         shoulda got yourself a girl.

               above, rudy peruses the page nick gave him. some lipstick 
               marks pressed to the paper. he passes it back, closes his 
               eyes.

                                     rudy
                         all i want... is to make it to sidnaw, 
                         and sit down for christmas dinner. 
                         watch some ball with my old man, 
                         sleep in my old bed, and have 
                         leftovers for bout six months.

                                     nick
                         thought you hated sidnaw.

                                     rudy
                         just taste that christmas turkey.

                                     nick
                         thought you hate your old man.

                                     rudy
                         five years, nicky. five years.
                              (shrugs)
                         i just want to go home.

               there's the echo of crashing metal gates. prisoners yelling. 
               nick smiles, still staring at his girl.

                                     nick
                         well, man. me and ashley. we'll be 
                         thinking about you.
