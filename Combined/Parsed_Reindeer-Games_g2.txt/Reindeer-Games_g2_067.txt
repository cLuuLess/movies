               int. gabriel's rig - day

               pitch black. we can barely make out a huddled, fetal form, 
               quaking and trembling. it's rudy. dripping wet, on the verge 
               of hypothermia. trying to stay conscious:

                                     rudy
                         i-i-i-i have n-n-no g-g-gifts to br-
                         br-bring, pa rum-p-p-p-p-p
                              (struggling)
                         ...pum-pum-pum. n-n-no treasures for 
                         the k-k-k
                              (waits)
                         ...king.

               the trailer doors swing open, crashing harsh light upon him. 
               he squints into the light, shivering madly.

                                     rudy
                         pa-rum-pum-pum-pum.
