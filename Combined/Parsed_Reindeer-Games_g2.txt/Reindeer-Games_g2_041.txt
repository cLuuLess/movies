               int. rudy's room - morning

               the bed has been dragged to the door to the bathroom, the 
               comforter and pillow are on the floor, "miracle on 34th st." 
               is on the tv, and rudy lies asleep on the ground, ankle still 
               cuffed.

               two shadows fall across him.
