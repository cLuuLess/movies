int. madison square garden - lo bianchos' box
the roar of the crowd and the barking of the pack
draw the attention of everyone in the lo bianchos'
box.
                        morty
          isn't that the emperor, ma'am?
                         mrs. lo biancho
          good god.   he's mauve.
