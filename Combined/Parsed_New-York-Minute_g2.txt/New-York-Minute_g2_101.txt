int. outer office - continuous action - day
a secretary sits at her computer.        she looks over her
glasses at parker.
                           secretary
             may i help you?
                           parker
             i'm here to see professor
             spaulding.
                           secretary
             you don't have an appointment.
                            parker
                     (beat)
             um, no. however...
                                                (continued)

                                                         98.

continued:
this is when the inner office door swings open and the
professor himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the
other, steps out.
parker positions herself directly in front of him,
cutting off his exit.
                           parker
             professor spaulding?
                             professor spaulding
             yes?
                           parker
             may i have a moment of your time?
                           professor spaulding
             i'm sorry, but i have a plane to
             catch.
he tries to make a move.      parker blocks him.
                          parker
             i know. but this is very
             important.
                           professor spaulding
             what is this about?
                           parker
             life and death, if you must know.
the professor hesitates for just an instant, giving
parker her opening. she grabs his hand, giving it a
vigorous, young republican shake.
                           parker
             i'm drew macleod.
                           professor spaulding
             ms. macleod, i hope this is
             interesting.
                             parker
             trust me.
