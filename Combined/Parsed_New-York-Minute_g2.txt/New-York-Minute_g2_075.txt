int. detective's car - same time
williamson and hogan have the same problem with the
traffic and can't see clearly what's going on up ahead.
                           williamson
             did one of them just get out?
                            hogan
             i think so.   maybe she's going for
             the dog.
                           williamson
             maybe that's what they want us to
             think.
                           hogan
             so we stay with the taxi?
                                               (continued)

             unless you want to hoof it after
             the other one.
                           hogan
             we stay with the taxi.
