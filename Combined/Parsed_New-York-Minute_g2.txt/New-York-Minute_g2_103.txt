int. professor spaulding's office - day
parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed
just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap.
                            parker
                      (primly)
             i promise you, though my missing
             the deadline seems to suggest
             otherwise, my studies would never
             suffer on account of my being
             unorganized. this was, and i
             think anyone who knows me would
             vouch for this, a complete
             anomaly.

             i was so thrown when my sister
             asked bernard to the dance that i
             simply failed to post the schedule
             request and seeing it already
             checked off on my to-do list, i
             over-looked it until after the
             deadline had passed.
                           professor spaulding
             ms. macleod, i recall your
             application being one of the
             strongest we received. not seeing
             your name on the interview list
             surprised me. i assumed, of
             course, that you'd changed your
             mind.
                           parker
             no. not at all. this program is
             my number one priority.
                           professor spaulding
             yes, well, i'm sure you can
             appreciate that with so many
             applicants for so few spaces there
             must be rules to govern the
             selection process.
a fuss from the outer office interrupts them and suddenly
the door bursts open and drew bursts in:
                           drew
             professor spaulding? i can't
             apologize enough for barging in
             like this.
the professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but
by drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.
                           professor spaulding
             no. please. it looks like i'm
             taking the red-eye now anyway.
drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a
face full of parker, already there.
                           drew
             parker?
                           parker
                     (worried wink)
             hi, parker.
                                               (continued)

                                                       101.

continued:
                           drew
             what are you doing?
                           parker
                     (don't blow it)
             oh, the professor and i have had a
             wonderful talk about how important
             this program is to me and how it
             was my sister, drew, who screwed
             things up.
                           professor spaulding
             i'm having a little trouble
             following this.
                           drew
             you were... being me?
                           professor spaulding
                     (to drew)
             would you like to sit down?
seeing her plan to help drew go awry, poor parker's lip
trembles.
                           parker
             when i saw them take you to
             jail...
                           professor spaulding
             jail?
                           parker
             ... i didn't think you'd make it.
             i knew i wouldn't be any good at
             it, but i figured at least there
             was a chance.
                            drew
                     (beat)
             that's... sweet.
                           parker
             you're not mad?
                           drew
             no.
                           parker
             i'm so sorry for today.
                                              (continued)

                                                           102.

continued:
                             drew
             it's okay.    but let's talk about
             it later.
                             professor spaulding
             please.    go right ahead.
                             parker
             thank you.
                           drew
             parker, consider, just for a
             moment, whether this is the
             appropriate time and place.
                           parker
             okay, i considered.     what i want
             to say is, i didn't    purposefully
             set out to ruin your    day, but that
             doesn't mean i'm not    a little...
             jealous.
                             drew
             jealous?
                           parker
             i'm not like you. i don't have
             your intensity, your focus, your...
                             professor spaulding
             fashion sense?
                            parker
             i just mean, maybe, even if i
             don't intend to, maybe that
             jealousy, you know, gets in the
             way sometimes.
                           drew
             you mean subliminally you're
             undermining me?
                           parker
             i don't know if i'd get that
             technical about it. but yeah.
                           drew
             well, thank you for saying that.
                            parker
             you're welcome.
                     (beat)
             aren't you going to confess now?
                                                  (continued)

                                                       103.

continued:
                             drew
             confess what?
                           professor spaulding
             there's got to be something. like
             how you lost your shoes?
                           parker
             how you're secretly jealous of me?
                           drew
             why would i be jealous of you?
                           parker
             oh, let me see. because i don't
             have a stick up my butt? because
             i know how to have fun? because
             i'm spontaneous and creative and
             men are all my love slaves?
drew stops, ponders this deeply.
                             drew
             nope.
then she smiles, only a teensy bit.
                           drew
             well, maybe about the love slaves.
this is the first moment in a long time when the sisters
share a smile. drew turns to the professor.
                           drew
             professor, i'm drew macleod.
                           professor spaulding
             are you certain?
                           drew
             i wanted more than anything in the
             world to be a part of your
             program. i still do. but i
             failed. i didn't follow the
             rules. and honestly, before
             today, i didn't know how i was
             going to live with that. how to
             live with failure. i'm not good
             at it. i haven't done it much.
             but today i realized that i've
             lived in fear of it too long.

                                                        104.

continued:
                           drew (cont'd)
             i hope my application was a strong
             one and i came here today to ask
             your indulgence and to place my
             name back into consideration. if
             you won't, i'll understand.
             better yet, i'll get over it.
             maybe i shouldn't be in such a
             hurry after all. maybe it would
             be best for me to just take
             this...
drew takes her daybook from parker and drops it in the
wastebasket.
                           drew
             ... and lighten up.
parker looks horrified at the sight of drew's daybook in
the trash and fishes it out.
                           drew
             thanks for your time. sorry if
             you missed your plane.
he shakes her hand.
                           professor spaulding
             it was worth it, i assure you.
             now, could you clear up one thing
             for me?
                           drew/parker
             sure.
                           professor spaulding
             what's this about jail?
                                              cut to:
