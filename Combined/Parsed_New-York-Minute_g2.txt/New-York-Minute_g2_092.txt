ext. madison square garden - front entrance -
continuous action
they catch up to her in a swarm, knocking her onto the
sidewalk outside where she disappears underneath a
mountain of dogs!
williamson, hogan, morty, bruce, mr. and mrs. lo biancho
and quite a few spectators pour out the doors.

                                                       89.

angle down on drew
still hugging the emperor in the middle of the pack, all
of whom gleefully lick her face!
                           drew
             please!  i'll get hives!
                     (resigned)
             oh, go ahead.

drew's pov
the detectives appear above her.


back to scene
she holds up the emperor.
                           drew
             i, uh, just wanted to return him.
as the other owners and handlers gather their dogs,
williamson hands the emperor off to mrs. lo biancho while
hogan handcuffs drew.
                           mrs. lo biancho
             flog her! step aside and i'll
             whip her myself!
                           mr. lo biancho
                     (dead calm)
             didn't you say it was a man who
             called, dear?
                           mrs. lo biancho
             so she had an accomplice! we'll
             beat the information out of the
             little wench!
                     (handing him
                      the emperor)
             get him cleaned up, emile.
williamson and hogan move drew toward their car.
                           drew
             i didn't take her dog, i swear.
                           williamson
             we'll sort it out.
                                               (continued)

                                                        90.

continued:
                           drew
             but i have this interview. i
             mean, it's not really an
             interview. i'd never lie to the
             police...
                     (it's over)
             ... never mind.
just as they push her head down into the car, she
glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad gawkers
-- it's the bike messenger. for just an instant they
lock eyes before the car pulls away.

down the street
parker and warren round the corner at a run, only in time
to watch the detective's car leave with drew in the back
window.
                           warren
             what now?
                           parker
             we have to go to the jail and tell
             them what happened.
                           warren
             what on earth did happen?
                           parker
             poor drew. she wanted to get into
             that program more than anything in
             the world.
with a sigh, they turn to go and bump -- knock into
bennie, who's staring coldly down at parker.
                           bennie
             you goin' somewhere?
she's paralyzed with fear.
                           warren
                     (gulp)
             hello, sir.
                            parker
             oh my god!   please don't kill me!
                           warren
             kill?
                                               (continued)

                                                           91.

continued:
                           parker
             we don't know anything at all! we
             didn't see anything or hear
             anything and i'll swear to that in
             a court of law!
bennie appears unmoved. parker closes her eyes, trying
to meet death with dignity.
                           parker
             just not in the face.
                           bennie
             what's the big idea? you two a
             couple a nutbags or somethin'?
she opens one eye.
                           parker
             nut bags? no. i mean,    yes. is
             there a right answer to  that?
             see, my sister had this  interview
             which turned out not to  be an
             interview, really and i  sort of
             messed things up because  i wanted
             to meet him.
indicating warren.
                            warren
             really?   you came into town just
             for me?   wow.
                           parker
             not now, warren.
                     (back to bennie)
             drew was going to be late even
             though technically she wasn't
             going to be late since there
             wasn't an interview and that's
             when we got in your car. i
             promise we meant to pay. it was a
             true emergency.
                           bennie
             i meant, why you runnin' when i'm
             trying to give you your bag back?
bennie hands parker drew's daybag.      parker takes it,
still trying to comprehend.
                           parker
             you were just...?
                                                 (continued)

                                                        92.

continued:
                           bennie
             i found your mom's number in the
             book. she said you needed it
             pretty badly for that big
             interview. listen, i gotta go.
             it's my mother-in-law's birthday
             and i gotta plant some stupid rose
             bush and then take her out to
             dinner at the pier. see ya
             around.
bennie waddles over to his town car and climbs in.
                           parker
                     (beat; calling after)
             thank you?
                           warren
             well, he certainly is a good
             samaritan.
parker looks at the daybag.
                           warren
             you guys lead a pretty interesting
             life, don't you?
but now parker's mind is elsewhere.     she pulls out drew's
daybook, opens it.
                           warren
             we going to the jail, or what?
             i've never been to a jail before.
                           parker
             what time is it?
                                              cut to:
