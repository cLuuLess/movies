int. bus - morning
sitting side by side. a young mother sits in front of
them with her nine-month-old baby who's standing on the
seat facing the girls.
drew's bump on her forehead is large and inflamed, her
hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number
four and glucose. she is in a really bad mood, only
staring straight ahead.
parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to
lighten up her sister's mood.
                        parker
          everything's going to be fine.
                  (to baby)
          peek-a-boo!
                        (more)
                                            (continued)

                                                         27.

continued:
                           parker (cont'd)
                     (to drew)
             we're practically there. we'll
             get you cleaned up, you'll get
             into the program and...
                     (to baby)
             peek-a-boo!
                     (to drew)
             ... we'll both look back on this
             and laugh our butts off.
blecch! the baby pukes all over drew.       she looks
sideways at her sister.
                           drew
             i will never, ever, forgive you.
