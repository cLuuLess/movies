int. drew's room - morning
drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. almost
trembling with tension, she enters and immediately sits
down at her desk with her dayplanner, turning to the
present date:
close on the page, where every fifteen minutes is color-
coded and accounted for right up to...
2:07 -- professor que spaulding, chair, new york
university accelerated studies program, administration
building, suite 101.
                           quinn (o.s.)
             come on, honey! let's tear up
             manhattan!
with a shiver, drew closes the book, looks up into the
mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
and tries some self-reassurance.
                           drew
             you're smart. you're resourceful.
             you'll find a way to make it work.
she tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
something in the smile suggests she's screwed.
collecting her dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
phone, she drops them into her matching coach shoulder bag.
