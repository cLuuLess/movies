int. quinn's saab - continuous action
ring! quinn's cell phone goes off. quinn looks annoyed,
checks the incoming number. drew closes her eyes and
prays.
                         quinn
                  (to phone)
          doctor macleod...
                  (beat; winking
                   at drew)
          i'm sorry, but my itinerary is
          booked solid today. call dr.
          wessels. he's covering for me.
                  (beat)
          he did?
                  (beat)
          are you sure it's the baby's head?
                  (beat)
          all right. i'm coming.
frustrated, mom hangs up and with a look of profound
disappointment, turns to drew.
                         quinn
          i'm sorry, hon. it's a blue light
          special in maternity. every bed's
          full and some poor woman is about
          to give birth in the gift shop. i
          have to go in.
drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.
                        drew
          ah, darn it, mom. that's a shame.
          it's like fate is conspiring
          against us.
                        quinn
          i know.
                        drew
          you absolutely, positively have to
          promise me we'll do it another
          time.
                        quinn
          i promise. i better hurry. have
          parker drop you at the train
          station on her way to school, will
          you?
quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.
                                           (continued)

                                                         11.

continued:
                           quinn
             kill 'em in that interview.
                            drew
                     (beat)
             mom, you know, i might not get in.
                           quinn
             are you kidding me? you're drew
             macleod. nobody's smarter, nobody
             works harder and nobody, and i
             mean nobody, is ever more
             prepared.
drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
with the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
shoulders, drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
this is when parker comes hauling down the driveway in
her honda accord. drew signals her to stop, so of course
her sister ignores her and jets into the street.
                            drew
             hey!   stop!
drew takes off running after the car!
                            drew
             parker!!
