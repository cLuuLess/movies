int. mini-mart - morning
... where they crouch down the magazine rack. among the
magazines is dog fancy with a picture of a chinese
crested hairless on the cover and the headline: "emperor
defends crown."
parker peers over the top and out the window.
parker's pov -- slowly, the lincoln cruises the street,
bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.
                         drew
           is he gone? i can't believe this.
           what did you get us into?
                           parker
           we lost him.    wow. that was a
           rush.
                          drew
           a rush?   are you out of your mind?
                          bum (o.s.)
           hey.   give me a quarter, will ya?
spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly homeless guy
with a slushee in his hand. they stand. parker reaches
in her pocket.
                                             (continued)

                                                       25.

continued:
                           mini-mart clerk
             get outta here, uncle jerry!
                           parker
                     (to homeless guy)
             i don't have any change, but here.
parker starts to find the homeless guy a dollar but drew
reaches over to stop her...
                            drew
             parker, you're only feeding the
             poor man's disease. buy him a
             healthy snack.
... just as the homeless guy reaches for the dollar and
the slushee is knocked from his hand.
we watch in slow motion as the slushee takes flight, the
cap falling off and the sticky, cherry red mess fanning
out until...
... back to fast motion -- splat!     it catches drew full-
faced, drenching her.
the homeless guy snags the dollar.
                           homeless guy
             i gotta go.
and he exits.     parker sniffs.
                          parker
             ew. that stinks. that's not just
             slushee.
the mini-mart clerk approaches them, shaking his head.
                           mini-mart clerk
             it's mad dog. look at that mess.
             it's gonna smell up the store all
             day.
drew appears stunned, unable to form words so parker
speaks for her.
                           parker
             may we use your bathroom please?
the cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down
drew's blank face.
                           mini-mart clerk
             gas station at the end of the
             block. have a nice day.

                                                      26.
