ext. loading dock (madison square garden) - continuous
action
chaos.
the two show officials,    sporting nifty sweaters and
manicures, are prepared    to sacrifice their lives to block
the door. in addition     to the participants trying to get
inside, they're holding    off roger, mr. lo biancho,
williamson and hogan.
                           show official #1
                     (quite disturbed)
             no entry without official
             credentials!
                           mr. lo biancho
             i'm emile lo biancho! i demand to
             be let in!
                            williamson
             nypd!   move aside!
at the mention of police, roger's eyes go wide. he
slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.
                           show official #1
                     (chin set)
             i'll have to see identification,
             officers.
                     (to mr. lo biancho)
             i'm so sorry, mr. lo biancho. go
             right in.
at the corner, parker and warren keep their distance, not
wanting to be seen by the detectives.
                           warren
             you think she made it?
                           parker
             she's faster than she looks.
                                              cut to:

                                                      88.
