int. first train car - morning
drew finds a seat.     she neatly folds her jacket and sets
it next to her.
she pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
her -- just right. next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. a pen
goes in the little holder. coffee from her thermos.
after laying out her interview materials, she turns to
her reflection in the window.
                           drew
                     (low; rehearsing)
             professor spaulding. good
             afternoon. i'm drew macleod.
an executive takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
a sideways glance at drew's portable office, opens his
wall street journal as the train begins to pull away.
every commuter is quietly reading the paper or staring
off into their own world, wondering why their life has
lead them to this sad moment when...
... they're all distracted by an awful, awful voice
singing sheryl crow's "soak up the sun." it's parker,
wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
train car.
drew stares at her, dumbfounded.
                           drew
             what do you think you're doing?
                           parker
                     (too loud; with
                      headphones on)
             looking for a seat.
                                                (continued)

                                                        13.

continued:
                           drew
             this can't be happening. wait, i
             know. this is one of those ground
             hog day dreams, isn't it?
drew pinches herself too hard.
                           drew
             ow!
                     (to parker)
             i'm awake now. you're supposed to
             disappear.
                           parker
                     (still too loud)
             you know, i just got this itch.
                           drew
             then scratch it and get back to
             school.
                           parker
             i couldn't concentrate anyway.
             i'm too... distracted today.
                            drew
             you're permanently distracted.
             it's called attention deficit
             disorder.
                     (spotting her
                       blackberry)
             is this about that chat room guy?
             it is, isn't it?
a look from the exec reminds parker of her headphones and
she pulls them off.
                           parker
             no! it's about spontaneity, which
             you obviously wouldn't know
             anything about.
                           drew
             i swear to god, parker, you go
             through boyfriends like junior
             mints. it's pathetic.
                           parker
             pathetic? you want to talk about
             pathetic?! at least i don't count
             getting accidentally felt up in
             dodge ball as my first date!
                           (more)
                                               (continued)

                                                           14.

continued:
                           parker (cont'd)
             you're going to be eighteen and
             you've never even had a boyfriend!
the executive furrows his brow at drew -- never?
                           drew
             is this any of your business?
he goes back to his paper.
                           drew
             this is ridiculous. i don't    have
             time for this today. fine.      don't
             graduate from high school.     make a
             mess of your life over some
             complete stranger. i don't     care.
             but leave me out. i have
             something important i need    to
             accomplish today, so please    go
             away.
                            executive
                     (to parker)
             would you like this seat so you
             two can fight?
                             drew/parker
             no thank you.
drew's alarm watch beeps.
                           drew
             i have to mentally preview my day
             now. i can't talk anymore.
parker turns to go, then remembers something.
                           parker
             uh, drew? do you have any money?
             i don't have enough for a ticket.
drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her
sister.
the executive peers over his spectacles at parker with
the old paternal reprimand look.
                            parker
             please.   like you never ditched
             school.
                                                 cut to:

                                                    15.
