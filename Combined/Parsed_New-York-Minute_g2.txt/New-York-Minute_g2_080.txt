he hits redial.       mrs. lo biancho answers.
                              mrs. lo biancho (v.o.)
             yesss?
                             roger
             okay.    here's how we make the --
                           mrs. lo biancho (v.o.)
                     (interrupting again)
             -- first of all, you forgot to
             disguise your voice.
                              roger
                        (to himself)
             damn it!
                           mrs. lo biancho (v.o.)
             secondly, my husband will meet you
             in ten minutes on the corner of
             43rd and broadway. he'll have the
             money. bring the dog.
                           roger
             but that's ridiculous!     you'll
             just bring the police!     no way!
             consider him kung pau!
                              mrs. lo biancho
             fine.
                              roger
             don't hang up!
                           mrs. lo biancho
             the police, it appears, have other
             priorities, like humans or
             something. and i assure you, the
             hotel security... people... will
             not interfere. in any case,
             little man, we just want the dog
             back before showtime, do you
             understand?
                                                  (continued)

                                                         84.

                       (beat)
             okay.
                             mrs. lo biancho
             ciao.
she hangs up.        roger does, too.
                           roger
                     (to the emperor)
             no wonder you look so happy. as
             far as you're concerned, you've
             escaped from the wicked witch of
             the west.
