parker's on the stairs with drew's daybook open, staring
into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes
but forgot to show up for the semester.
warren's looking over her shoulder.
                            warren
             wow.   and i thought i was anal.
                           parker
             this is no good. i don't do too
             well with the whole rehearsal
             thing. i'm more of a 'wing it'
             person.
parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass.
working herself into drew form, she puts her hair into a
conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.

             how's this look? drewish?
                           warren
             you know, i've always had a thing
             for librarians.
                           parker
             warren, honesty is fine. but you
             could edit a little, you know?
                             warren
             got it.
                             parker
             wish me luck.
                           warren
             good luck, drew.
