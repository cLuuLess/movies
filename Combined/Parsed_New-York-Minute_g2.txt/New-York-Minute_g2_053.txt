int. macleod house - charley's study
head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe,
charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his
laptop. the screensaver, an animated version of         jack
nicholson in the shining, just keeps typing "all        work and
no play..."
when the phone rings it nearly knocks him out of his
chair. he hunts it down through the maelstrom on his
desk.
                            charley
                     (to phone)
             wal-mart?
                     (beat)
             hey, marvin. you bet.    typing
             away.
he glances at the screensaver, the same words pouring
out.
                            charley
                      (suddenly concerned)
             today?
                     (beat)
             gee, i'm on a real roll, marv.
             the juices overfloweth, if you get
             my meaning. don't want to plug
             the juices when they're
             overflowing, right?
                     (whoa)
             how much?
                     (beat)
             hm. i guess i could carve out
             some time.
                                                  (continued)

                                                          59.

continued:
charley smells his armpit.       ripe.   he'll need a quick
shower.
                            charley
             got it.   see you in the city.
charley hangs up, punches a key on his computer.       the
screensaver disappears and up pops a blank page.       at the
top: chapter one. nothing else.
                                                cut to:
