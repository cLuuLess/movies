int. jail lobby - day
hogan leads her into the lobby where bike messenger guy
is waiting. he stands up when he sees drew. her
dissonance is even more confounded now.
                                                (continued)

                                                         95.

continued:
                           hogan
             there's your alibi.
                           drew
             i don't even know him.
                           hogan
             that's what he said. go home.
             get cleaned up, a good night's
             sleep. none of this will seem so
             bad in the morning.
hogan leaves them alone.       bike guy steps over.
                             bike guy
             you okay?
as an answer, drew merely points to herself -- look at
me? now answer for yourself.
                           bike guy
             i'm jim wessler.
                             drew
             thanks, jim.    how'd you know?
                           jim (bike guy)
             who could forget that face?
reminded, drew puts a hand to her face.
                             drew
             huh.    no hives.
suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, drew
becomes self-conscious.
                             drew
             well... bye.
she walks past him out the door.
                             jim
             wait.    where are you going?
