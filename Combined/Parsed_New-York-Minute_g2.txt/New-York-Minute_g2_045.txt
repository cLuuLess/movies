int. runway show - backstage - day
chaos. models, dressers, sycophants, "i only date
models" guys and the famous couture fashion designer,
bobo, are mid-show and friggin' frantic.
                        bobo
                  (french accent)
          where are they?! no more breaks!
          do you hear me! we have a show to
          do, you nitwits! models! bah!
          you have hollow gourds for heads!
          the kind they make those mexican
          rattles out of!
                           showrunner
                     (always at his elbow)
          maracas.
                        bobo
          maracas! maracas that take coffee
          breaks when i am paying them a
          fortune!
bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and
physically grabs them both, pushing them at the
showrunner.
                          bobo
          hair!  makeup!
                   (parker)
          daywear!
                   (drew)
          clubbing! vite!
this is when he gets a load of drew's matted hair,
running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.
hm. does he like it?
                        bobo
                  (confess)
          is that helmut lang?
                  (recovering himself)
          go!
the showrunner shoves drew one way, parker the other --
drew looks at her -- what the hell? parker clearly
mouths: hair! makeup! clothes! and teams of dressers
virtually surround them.
inside the mob of dressers surrounding drew the hair
stylist raises his brush and scissors, but pauses.
the rest of the team stops, watching him make his
decision. he shrugs.
                                             (continued)

                                                        49.

continued:
                           hairstylist
             perfection.
he excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into
couture.
                                              cut to:

dressing team - a moment later
and   the dressing team surrounding parker parts, revealing
her   in a very un-parker-like, super-chic business suit.
she   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls
her   eyes. boring.
the drew team parts and    we are stunned to see they've
chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture freak show
outfit that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix
and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini.
on parker who spots drew and is, for the first time in
the movie, speechless.
                           drew
             why does this not surprise me?
the next music cue comes up and the showrunner grabs
drew...
                           drew
             excuse me, but i'm supposed to be
             going to my college interview.
                          showrunner
             that's rich. a model going to
             college. what next? talking
             monkeys?
... and pushes her through the curtains and...
