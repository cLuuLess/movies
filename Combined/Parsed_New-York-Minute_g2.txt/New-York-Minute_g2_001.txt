ext. suburban street - dawn
close on the anxious, sweating, frightened face of drew
macleod, 17, running to save her life. think dustin
hoffman in marathon man -- someone, something -- is after
her but unseen.
she glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her breathing becoming more labored.
cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing footsteps and quickening breaths.

drew's pov - her own front door
and safety loom half a block down. she pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and slams it shut.

angle on the shrub
where, with the camera at ground level, a golden
retriever puppy, unable to leap the hedge, plows into it
headfirst and disappears. yelp!
