int. first train car - morning
the conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take
when he sees drew.
                           conductor
          very funny.
                           drew
          excuse me?
                           conductor
          let's go.
he takes her by the arm.
                        drew
          what are you doing?
drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.
                        conductor
          i tried to be nice about it, but
          if you want the police involved,
          this is the way to do it.
                           drew
          police?     i didn't do anything.
                        conductor
          no ticket, no train ride.
                        drew
                  (realizing)
          no! that's not me! that was my
          twin sister you threw off!
                        conductor
          young lady, in thirty years i have
          heard every possible line but
          that's the lamest ever.
                        drew
                  (pointing)
          she's right there!

angle on the platform
no parker.
he hauls drew down the aisle but as they exit the car,
she bumps head-on into bike messenger/pre-med/mountain
climber/male model guy -- they really do crack foreheads,
ouch!
                                           (continued)

                                                       17.

continued:
is drew seeing stars? or is it the magic of this instant
in time with dream guy?
both of them shake off the woozies.     he smiles:
                            dream guy
             you okay?
                            drew
             i'm... ouch.
                           conductor
             she's fine, considering she should
             be in jail.
as the conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
dream guy share a last look before she's...
... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
still no sign of parker and drew doesn't have all her
wits about her.
                             drew
             this   can't be happening! i have
             a...   a... little paper thingy.
             what   are they called? ticket! i
             have   a ticket! it's right...
she drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. on her
hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
in the mess.
the conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
it pulls away. he just waves, victorious.
parker    steps back out onto the platform and the conductor
spots    her. he looks from one sister to the other --
oops,    mistake. but it's too late. sheepishly, he climbs
inside    and the train is gone.
                           drew
                     (to the gods)
             aarrggh! parrr... kerrr!
parker steps up from behind her.
                           parker
             you get kicked off, too? why
             didn't you just buy a ticket?
parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but
drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.
                                              (continued)

                                                    18.

continued:
                             drew
             don't.
                           parker
             what happened to your head?
                           drew
             oh, just a minor concussion i
             sustained while the conductor was
             throwing me off the train because
             he thought i was you sneaking back
             on the train!
                             parker
             sorry.
                             drew
             i'll bet.
drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the
ticket counter. the welt on her forehead is gonna be a
doozey.
                             parker
                       (calling after)
             i am!    where are you going?
                           drew
             to see when the next train
             leaves.
                             parker
             i already --
but drew's inside the stationhouse.
                          parker
             -- did. they said something about
             a delay.
parker follows into the stationhouse.
