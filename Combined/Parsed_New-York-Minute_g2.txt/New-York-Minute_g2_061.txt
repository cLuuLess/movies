                           warren
             hey, angie, take the 11:00 for me,
             will you?
                             angie (tour guide)
             no way.    judge judy's on.
drew grabs angie by the collar, lifts her up.
                             drew
             angie?    take the 11:00.
                           angie
                     (to warren)
             you owe me, warren.
angie heads out to take the tour.        parker turns on
warren.
                           parker
             are you a lying sack, or what?
                           warren
             what was i supposed to do? i
             liked you. if i'd sent a real
             picture, would you have met me?
                           parker
             that's not the point.
                           warren
             that means no. at least this way
             i got to see you before you blow
             me off.
                           drew
             no one is blowing you off, warren.
             as a matter of fact, we're very
             happy to see you, aren't we,
             parker?
                             parker
             i guess.
                           drew
             and we're grateful for your help.
                           parker
             this is my sister, drew.
                           warren
             not-a-twin, huh?
                                                  (continued)

                                                          68.

continued:
                            parker
             that's a joke.
                           warren
             yeah, well. i guess everybody
             would like the world to see them a
             little bit differently than they
             are.
                           drew
                     (quickly interjecting)
             super. now that that's all
             settled, is there a restroom i can
             get to without going out there?
                           warren
             what's wrong with going out there?
                           parker
             police, for one thing.
                            warren
             police?   i thought you guys were
             joking.
                           parker
             it's the kind of joke that will be
             a lot funnier a few years from now.
                            warren
             well that door's the only way out.
             there's a restroom at the end of
             the main hall.
parker opens the office door, peeking out.
                            drew
             they there?
                           parker
             i don't see 'em.

angle on williamson and hogan
who parker can't see because her line of sight is blocked
by the office door.


back to drew and warren
                           drew
             they must be searching the
             building.
                                                 (continued)

                                                         69.

continued:
                           warren
             what'd you guys do, anyway?    mug a
             couple supermodels?
                            drew
             let's go.
with warren leading the way, they exit the office.
