ext. alley behind the plaza - day
drew's still frozen on the fire escape.
                             drew
             i can't do it!
                             parker
             yes you can!


angle on the end of the alley
where roger appears with the emperor. surprised        to see
the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but
they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he
quietly makes his way to his van (painted on the       back and
sides: "michelangelo's painting: a masterpiece         every
time".
                             drew
             no i can't!
                           parker
             have fun in prison. under 'summer
             internships' on your college
             application, you can write
             'license plate manufacturing.'
                                                 (continued)

                                                          46.

continued:
roger's van squeals away, drawing parker's attention.
she glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears
around the corner into traffic.
shutting her eyes, drew drops onto the closed lid of the
dumpster.
                           drew
                     (astonished)
             i did it.
oops, the curtain starts to slip. when she reaches for
it she loses her balance and suddenly -- fwonk --
nosedives into the dumpster. the curtain floats into the
alley at parker's feet.
                              drew (o.s.)
             ow!
                           parker
             get out of there!
                            drew (o.s.)
                     (beat)
             give me... my... curtain.
parker tosses the curtain in and drew climbs out.        they
hurry off down the alley.
in the second story fire escape window -- morty appears.
                             morty
             stop!    bring back that dog!
morty's pov -- the girls near the end of the alley. a
small dog could easily be concealed under that shower
curtain.
on the girls -- running full-tilt, drew turns to parker.
                           drew
             he thinks we have the dog!
                           parker
             a painter took it!
                              drew
             a pain --
wham! -- drew's       clotheslined at the intersection by a
bike messenger       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her,
brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands
right on top of       her.
                                                 (continued)

                                                       47.

continued:
it's dream guy from the train and for a confused beat
they look into each other's familiar faces where we read
recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:
                           dream guy
             you know, one of us is gonna get
             hurt if we keep doing this.
o.s. sirens signal that the police are now involved.
                           parker
             hey, complete stranger!      get off
             my sister!
parker yanks drew from underneath dream guy.
                           drew
             i'm, uh, late for this place,
             thing, where i'm supposed to be.
             college. interview!
                             dream guy
             where at?
but parker's got her by the arm and she can only call
back over her shoulder...
                             drew
             nyu!
... before disappearing into the crowd on the sidewalk.
                              dream guy
                        (too late)
             me, too!
around the corner comes morty who, without time to react,
trips headfirst over bike messenger guy.
