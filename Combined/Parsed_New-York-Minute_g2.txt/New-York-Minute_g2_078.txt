int. roger's van - continuous action
roger looks at the phone. it wasn't supposed to go like
that. he looks at the emperor.
                           roger
             well, mr. fancy pants. you can
             wipe that stupid smile off your
             face. i don't think they love you
             as much as you think they do.
he glances at his watch.      he believes mrs. lo biancho and
is panicking.
