int. trenton train station
drew has reached the counter, where a bitter train clerk
who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of
angry commuters.
                        drew
          that can't be.  i have to be there
          before two!
                        train clerk
          well, maybe if you flap your arms
          real fast you can fly there,
          because you won't get there on a
          train.
                        drew
                  (about to explode)
          what did you just say?
                                           (continued)

                                                         20.

parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.
                            parker
             come on.   hurry. i got us a ride.
                           drew
             let go of my arm.
but parker drags her away. drew shoots a look back at
the clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.
