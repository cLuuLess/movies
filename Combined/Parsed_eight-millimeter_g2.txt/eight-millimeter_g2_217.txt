     int.  eddie's living room -- day

     welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains.
     he turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom.  after a
     moment, he returns, dragging eddie on the floor...

     eddie's bleeding out his nose, hands duct-taped together
     behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt
     around his neck, choking...

     welles drops the belt, undoes it from eddie's neck.  eddie
     gasps for air.  welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.

                             welles
                 don't go anywhere.

     welles heads for the stairs...
