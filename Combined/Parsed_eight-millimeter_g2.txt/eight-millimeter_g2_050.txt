                 hello, mrs. christian?  tom welles.
                 here's where we stand.  i checked
                 the film stock and it's called supra-
                 lux 544.  the company that made that
                 stock discontinued it in '92...
                       (listens)
                 yeah, about five or six years ago.
                 anyway, do what you can to dig up
                 your husband's old financial
                 records, look for anything out of
                 the ordinary...
