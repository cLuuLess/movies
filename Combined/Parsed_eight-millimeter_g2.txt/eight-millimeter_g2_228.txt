     ext.  big bear motor lodge -- night

     eddie and welles come around the corner of the abandoned
     motel, eddie leading the way, welles following with gun and
     flashlight, into the dense forest...

                             eddie
                 what are you thinking you're gonna
                 do... ?

     welles shoves eddie ahead.

                             welles
                 keep moving.

                             eddie
                 where do you think you're taking
                 this, huh?  gonna be a big hero,
                 avenge that little girl's death?
                 gonna make everything right with the
                 world?  how you gonna do that... ? 

     further on

     welles and eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...

                             eddie
                 you can't go to the cops.  all you
                 can do is cut me loose and walk
                 away, because you got nothing...

                             welles
                 stop talking.

                             eddie
                 you got absolute zero.

                             welles
                 show me where you buried her.

                             eddie
                 i don't know...
                       (nods to forest)
                 ... out there somewhere.

                             welles
                 where?  show me where.

                             eddie
                 i fucking don't know.  what do you
                 think... we weren't burying
                 treasure.  we didn't pace it out so
                 we could come back and get it.  we
                 dug a hole and we put her in it.
                 your guess is as good as mine.

     welles walks ahead of eddie, distraught, shining his
     flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.

                             eddie
                 you'll never find her.  nobody ever
                 will, and even if they did, it
                 doesn't mean nothing.  bring in the
                 cops, bring in the f.b.i., fuck 'em
                 all.  without the film, it never
                 happened.  don't you get it?  it's
                 over.  you can't do anything.

     welles turns, aims his gun at eddie, furious.

                             welles
                 i can kill you.  i can leave you out
                 here, just like you left her.

     eddie's not backing down.

                             eddie
                 do it.

                             welles
                 don't think i won't.

                             eddie
                 do it!  put me out of my misery so
                 i don't have to listen to you
                 whining anymore.  you think it's so
                 easy?

                             welles
                 easy enough for you.

                             eddie
                 i never killed anyone.

                             welles
                 that's right, you just stood there
                 and watched, because you "felt like
                 it."  almost makes you worse.

                             eddie
                 what do you want?  you want me to
                 fall to my knees and start crying
                 like a baby... ?

     eddie walks towards welles.  welles backs away...

                             eddie
                 where you going?  you're the one
                 with the gun.  aren't i defenseless
                 enough?  come on...

     eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.

                             eddie
                 go ahead and kill me.  kill me with
                 that gun, your gun, right,
                 registered in your name?  dig the
                 hole yourself, with your bare hands,
                 bury the body with your bullets in
                 it.  fucking do it!

     welles step forward, presses the gun against eddie's
     forehead, pulls back the hammer... 

     eddie just stares back at welles with hatred in his eyes.

     welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage
     to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...
