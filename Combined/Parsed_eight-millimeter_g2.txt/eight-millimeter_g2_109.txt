     ext.  adult bookstore -- day

     welles stands down the sidewalk, smoking.  max comes out
     from the porn shop, walks to welles, looking around.

                             max
                 i don't know what you're looking
                 for, mister, but so we're clear from
                 the start, i'm straight.

                             welles
                 good for you.

     welles and max walk down the block, past homeless men with
     shopping carts overflowing with junk.

                             welles
                 how long you been working there?

                             max
                 three, four years.

                             welles
                 what's your name, if you don't mind
                 me asking? 

                             max
                 max.

                             welles
                 well, here's the deal, max.  this
                 thing i'm on right now has something
                 to do with underground pornography.
                 stuff that's sold under the counter,
                 illegally...

                             max
                 there's not much illegal.

                             welles
                 well, whatever there is, whoever's
                 dealing, however it's done, i want
                 to know.  i want a good look, so if
                 you've got that kind of connection,
                 great.  if not, speak now.

                             max
                 you're not a cop, are you?  if i ask
                 and you are, you have to tell me.

                             welles
                 i'm not a cop.

                             max
                 you're a private eye.  like shaft.

                             welles
                 not quite.

                             max
                 from pennsylvania.  p.i. from pa.
                 what are you doing out here?

                             welles
                 well, there's the thing; you're not
                 gonna know anything about what i'm
                 doing, but you can make some money.

                             max
                 how much?

                             welles
                 how much do you make now?

                             max
                 four hundred a week, off the books.

                             welles
                 okay, let's pretend i live in the
                 same fantasy world where you make
                 four hundred a week in that dump.
                 i'll give you six hundred for a few
                 days. 

                             max
                 sounds good, pops.

                             welles

                       (writes on scrap paper)
                 when can you start?

                             max
                 tomorrow night, i get off at eight.

                             welles
                 see you then.  oh, and, don't call
                 me "pops."

     welles walks away.
