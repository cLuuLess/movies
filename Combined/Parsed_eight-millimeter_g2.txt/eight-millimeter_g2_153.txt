     int.  1204 warehouse, elevator -- day

     welles follows the women into a decrepit elevator.  one
     woman hits "2."  welles hits "3," steps back in the corner.
     elevator doors creak closed.  the two women are heavily made
     up, pretty, but worn, eyes dull.

     welles looks down at the leg of one woman, noticing bruises
     through her fishnet stockings, poorly covered by make-up.

     elevator doors open on the second floor.  the two women get
     out and walk down a grey hallway, towards double doors
     painted black.  welles stops the elevator door from closing.

     the women push the intercom at the black doors.  another
     dull buzz is heard as the women enter.  the low rumble of
     heavy metal music is heard, silenced as doors swing shut.

     welles lets the elevator close.
