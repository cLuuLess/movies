     ext.  miami beach discotheque -- night 

     young republican and a gaudy woman exit the disco, music
     throbbing out from the doors behind them.  they join hands,
     drunk, heading to the street, looking for their limo. 

     down the street

     welles is seated in his parked rental car, raises a camera
     with telephoto lens: whir, click, whir, click, whir, click...
     welles lowers the camera, letting out a yawn.
