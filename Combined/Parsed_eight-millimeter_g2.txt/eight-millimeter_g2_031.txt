     int.  welles' house, kitchen -- night

     welles twists the lock box dial's combination, opens the box
     to reveal his gun, holster and cleaning supplies.  welles
     takes out the gun, cleaning it.  amy watches.

                             welles 
                 this is the mortgage.  this is
                 cindy's college money. 

                             amy
                 i understand.

                             welles 
                 sometimes you can't know what i'm
                 doing.  it's better that way.

                             amy
                 i know.

                             welles 
                 it's a missing persons case... a
                 long shot.  i'll give it two months,
                 two months at most, then i'll be
                 back.  we'll take a vacation.

                             amy
                 why the gun? 

                             welles 
                 i'm not gonna need it.  i won't even
                 wear it.  it's a precaution.
                       (cleaning gun)
                 don't worry about me.
