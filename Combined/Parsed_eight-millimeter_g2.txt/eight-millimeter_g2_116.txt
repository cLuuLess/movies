     int.  all-night coffee shop -- night

     not many people in the place.  welles drinks coffee.  max
     eats a huge breakfast.

                             max
                 you've got penthouse, playboy,
                 hustler, etc.  nobody even considers
                 them pornography anymore.  then,
                 there's mainstream hardcore.  triple
                 x.  the difference is penetration.
                 that's hardcore.  that whole
                 industry's up in the valley.
                 writers, directors, porn stars.
                 they're celebrities, or they think
                 they are.  they pump out 150 videos
                 a week.  a week.  they've even got
                 a porno academy awards.  america
                 loves pornography.  anybody tells
                 you they never use pornography,
                 they're lying.  somebody's buying
                 those videos.  somebody's out there
                 spending 900 million dollars a year
                 on phone sex.  know what else?  it's
                 only gonna get worse.  more and more
                 you'll see perverse hardcore coming
                 into the mainstream, because that's
                 evolution.  desensitization.  oh my
                 god, elvis presley's wiggling his
                 hips, how offensive!  nowadays,
                 mtv's showing girls dancing around
                 in thong bikinis with their asses
                 hanging out.  know what i mean?  for
                 the porn-addict, big tits aren't big
                 enough after a while.  they have to
                 be the biggest tits ever.  some porn
                 chicks are putting in breast
                 implants bigger than your head,
                 literally.  soon, playboy is gonna be
                 penthouse, penthouse'll be hustler,
                 hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore
                 films'll be medical films.
                 people'll be jerking off to women
                 laying around with open wounds.
                 there's nowhere else for it to go.

                             welles
                 interesting theory.

                             max
                 what you saw tonight, we're not
                 talking about a video some dentist
                 takes home over the weekend.  we're
                 talking about stuff where people get
                 hurt.  specialty product. 

                             welles
                 child pornography.

                             max
                 there's two kinds of specialty
                 product; legal and illegal.  foot
                 fetish, shit films, watersports,
                 bondage, spanking, fisting, she-
                 males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond
                 hardcore, but legal.  this is the
                 kind of hardcore where one guy's
                 going to look at it and throw up,
                 another guy looks at it and falls in
                 love.  now, with some of the s+m and
                 bondage films, they straddle the
                 line.  how are you supposed to tell
                 if the person tied up with the ball
                 gag in their mouth is a consenting
                 or not?  step over that line, you're
                 into kiddie porn.  rape films, but
                 there aren't many.  i've never seen
                 one.

                             welles
                 snuff films.

                             max
                 i heard you asking.  that guy wasn't
                 yanking you around.  there's no such
                 thing.

                             welles
                 what other ways are there to get
                 illegal films?  who do you see?

                             max
                 first of all, basement sales like
                 tonight aren't gonna last much
                 longer.  it's too risky, one, and
                 two, everything's going on the
                 internet.  anyone with a computer
                 and enough patience can find
                 anything he wants.  it's heaven for
                 those degenerate chicken-hawks.
                 they're swapping pictures back and
                 forth as fast as their modems can
                 zap 'em.  but, there's still some
                 weird shit under the counter where
                 i work sometimes.  no one knows where
                 it comes from.  that's local
                 underground, where information
                 spreads by word of mouth.  those are
                 zombies, hardcore junkies.  their
                 hands are permanently pruned.  they
                 go out in the sun they don't burn,
                 they blister.  other than that, all
                 i know about is the mail.
                 classified ads in the paper with
                 hidden codes.  secret couriers.
                 credit card orders to dummy
                 corporations.  interstate wire
                 transfers.  revolving p.o. boxes.
                 but, if you're asking me who do you
                 go to to get illegal shit... who
                 knows?  that's the whole point --
                 the seller stays as far away from
                 the buyer as possible, and vice
                 versa, and cops can't trace the
                 deal.  there's ways to do it so
                 nobody knows who anybody is.

                             max

                 the parade of losers that comes into
                 that place without going numb.  so
