     int.  motor lodge room -- night

     the door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge.
     eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him.  welles
     pushes eddie forward, gun out.

     welles turns on his penlight flashlight, shining it into the
     room.  there dead leaves all over the floor.  the room's
     empty except for a chair lying on its side.

     welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light.  this is
     where mary anne mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the
     snuff film, without the furniture.

                             eddie
                 what are we doing here?

     welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on
     eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot...

     the bathroom's cracked mirror reflects the penlight and
     welles' palely lit face.

                             welles 
                 that night... you didn't have to be
                 in the room, but you were.
                       (looks to eddie)
                 why?  why did you watch?

     eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.

                             eddie
                 i don't know.  i felt like it.  i
                 never saw anyone get done before.

                             welles
                 you enjoy it? 

                             eddie
                 made me sick, but what did i care?
                 what did i care if some hump wants
                 to beat off to that.  it was just
                 something i was doing for money.

                             welles
                 tell me what happened.

                             eddie
                 what do you want to know?  you saw
                 it, you saw the loop...

                             welles
                 nobody saw you bring her in?

                             eddie
                 there wasn't nobody around.  this
                 place was a shit-hole.  i backed up
                 the car to the door and we carried
                 her in, like groceries.  dino made
                 her eat a bunch of pills, we laid
                 out the plastic, put film in the
                 camera and machine went to work.

                             welles
                 what did you do with her body?

                             eddie
                 took it out the bathroom window.
                 buried it in the woods.

                             welles
                 show me.
