     int.  christian house, library -- night 

     the butler shows welles in, shuts the door.
     towering shelves of books are serviced by ladders.  far
     across the room, an old, sad woman, mrs. christian, sits
     waiting with a tall, thin, sinister ghoul of a lawyer.

                             mrs christian 
                 mister welles. you're very prompt.   

                             welles 
                 i try to be.

     welles crosses towards them. it takes a while. 

                             mrs christian 
                 i appreciate your coming on such
                 short notice. 

     mrs. christian holds out her hand and welles takes it. 

                             mrs christian
                 this is mister longdale, my late
                 husband's attorney. 

     welles shakes longdale's limp hand, looking him over. 

                             welles 
                 uh huh, pleasure. 

                             mrs christian 
                 apparently mr. longdale has
                 something he feels he simply must
                 say before you and i speak.

                             longdale 
                 yes, i do have something to say.  i
                 insisted on being here as soon as i
                 heard mrs. christian contacted you. 

                             welles 
                 i'm listening. 

                             longdale 
                 as mr. christian's attorney and one
                 of the executors of his estate, it
                 concerns me that a meeting of this
                 sort should take place without my
                 being asked to attend. 

                             welles
                 of what sort? 

                             longdale
                 you are a private investigator? 

                             welles 
                 that's right. 

                             longdale 
                 well, whatever reasons mrs.
                 christian has for engaging the
                 services of a private investigator,
                 i should certainly be a party to.
                 but, since she feels differently, i
                 can only go on the record as having
                 expressed my adamant disapproval. 

                             mrs christian 
                 yes, how theatrical.  so you've gone
                 on the record, and now perhaps you
                 should just be gone. 

     longdale's irritated, but has no choice.  he walks away. 

                             mrs christian 
                 have a pleasant evening. 
                       (to welles) 
                 will you have tea, mister welles? 

                             welles
                 thank you. 

     mrs. christian begins pouring tea from the service on a
     table.  welles watches longdale exit. 

                             welles 
                 he's odd.

                             mrs christian 
                 he's a lawyer.
                       (offers tea)
                 please, sit, here...

     welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer, taking a seat.

                             mrs christian 
                 i've spoken to friends of mine and
                 my husband's, in harrisburg, in
                 lancaster and hershey.  asking about
                 you.  i must say you have friends in
                 influential places. 

                             welles
                 i've been privileged to provide
                 services for people i admire.

                             mrs christian 
                 you are highly recommended.  praised
                 for your discretion... your strict
                 adherence to confidentiality. 

     welles nods, sipping tea. 

                             mrs christian 
                 as you know, my husband passed away
                 recently.  two weeks ago now.

                             welles 
                 my condolences. 

                             mrs christian 
                 his passing has left me with...
                 something of a dilemma.  a terrible,
                 terrible dilemma. 

                             welles 
                 i'll do whatever i can to help. 

     mrs. christian studies welles.
