     int.  adjacent office -- night

     welles has transferred most of his belongings here, suitcase
     open on the floor, card table set up with fast food on it,
     an army cot against one wall.  welles sits in a chair at the
     window, looks through binoculars on a tripod.

     welles' p.o.v., through binoculars: searching up the dark
     floors of the blue building, as welles counts under his
     breath.  moving over... stopping on one window, focusing...

     welles locks the tripod.  he goes to sit on the army cot,
     picks up his cellular.  he looks at the phone, deciding.
     he puts down the phone.  he turns off the lamp on the floor,
     lays back in the cot, going to sleep.
