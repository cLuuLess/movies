     int.  adjacent office -- day

     welles' p.o.v., through binoculars: watching the window of
     celebrity films inc.  we can see most of the office from
     here.  it's crowded with junk, boxes, piles of video tapes.
     there's a disorganized desk by the window.

     welles sits looking through the binoculars.

     through binoculars: a pudgy man, eddie poole, in a loud,
     print shirt, comes to sit at the desk, looks through mail.
     he smells sleazy even from here, lots of jewelry, lots of
     rings.  he drinks coffee, answers the phone.  he talks into
     the phone, looking for something on his desk, agitation
     growing, till he's shouting, then slams the phone down.

     welles rises.  he looks to the wall where three photographs
     culled from the snuff film are pinned up; the picture of
     mary, the picture of masked man's tattooed hand, and...

     ... the grainy image of the third man in the mirror.
     welles comes to study this third photo.
