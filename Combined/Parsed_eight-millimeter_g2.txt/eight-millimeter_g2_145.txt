     int.  adjacent office -- day

     welles' receiver/tape recorder's set up by the window,
     recording, with the tone decoder plugged into it.  welles
     listens through headphone, looking through binoculars.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... half a dozen.  this is good
                 stuff, jimbo...

     through binoculars: eddie's at his desk, on the phone...

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 you know how my tapes sell.  people
                 eat this stuff up.

                             male voice (v.o.)
                       (from phone)
                 i had three jerkoffs trying to
                 return your tapes last month.  do
                 you know how bad a skin flick has to
                 be for some jackass to come back
                 into my place with a fucking receipt,
                 and try to fucking return it? 

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 maybe there's something wrong with
                 the scumbag customers coming into
                 your place, ever think of that?

                             male voice (v.o.)
                 the only thing wrong is the cheap,
                 softcore crap you're peddling,
                 eddie.  where do you get this stuff?

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 look, you cocksucker...

                             male voice (v.o.)
                 get together some upscale product
                 where the girls still have teeth in
                 their head.  till then, fuck you.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 fuck you!

     through binoculars: eddie slams down the phone.  he cannot
     be heard any longer.  he's cursing, shuffling paperwork.

     welles takes off headphones, picks up his cellular phone.
     he drinks soda, opens the phone, dials, nervous, then looks
     back through the binoculars.  he waits, clears his throat.
     the phone's ringing... ringing...

     on the floor, the reels of the tape recorder are turning...

     through binoculars: eddie answers the phone...

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 celebrity films.

                             welles (v.o.)
                 eddie.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 yeah, who's this?

                             welles (v.o.)
                 i know what you did.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 what?

                             welles (v.o.)
                 i know what you did.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 who is this.

                             welles (v.o.)
                 you murdered that girl, eddie.  six
                 years ago... 

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 what the fuck are you.. ?

                             welles (v.o.)
                 you killed that girl and you put it
                 on film.  you and your pals, you're
                 fucked.  you fucked up real good.

     welles hits disconnect, still looking through binoculars.

     through binoculars: eddie's slow to hang up the phone.  he
     stands, looking down at the phone, frozen.  finally, he runs
     his hands through his hair, looks around the room, sits back
     down.  he gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink.

     welles watches through binoculars, puts headphones back on.

                             welles
                 come on, eddie...

     through binoculars: eddie sits motionless.

                             welles (o.s.)
                 ... come on...

     through binoculars: eddie picks up the phone, dials a
     number.  we hear the phone ring in the headphones

                             man's voice (v.o.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... hello?

                             eddie (v.o.)
                       (through headphones)
                 dino, it's eddie... eddie poole...

                             dino (v.o.)
                 what do you want?

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 i just got a call... two seconds
                 ago, some motherfucker called...
                 says he knows about the loop.

                             dino (v.o.)
                 what are you talking about?

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 the loop!  the girl we did, what the
                 fuck do you think i'm talking
                 about?!  this guy calls and says he
                 knows about the fucking loop...

                             dino (v.o.)
                 bullshit.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 i'm telling you... 

                             dino (v.o.)
                 blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's
                 impossible.  why are you bothering
                 me with this... ?

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 because somebody just fucking called
                 me and fucking laid it out!

                             dino (v.o.)
                 there's nothing there, you brain-
                 dead cunt.  think about it.  there's
                 absolutely no way in this world to
                 connect us to anything.  i want you
                 to hang the phone up, and if you
                 call me about this again i'm going
                 to send a friend of mine out there
                 and have him crack you open with a
                 fucking rib spreader.

                             eddie (v.o.)
                 dino...

                             dino (v.o)
                 nobody knows anything.

     through binoculars: as dino is heard hanging up, eddie
     reacts, picks up his phone and throws it across the office.

     welles sits back, trying to accept the realization that he's
     found them.  he looks to the photo of the third man.

                             welles
                 that is you, isn't it, eddie?

     welles goes to the recorder, turns on the tone decoder.  its
     led window lights up.  welles hits stop, rewind, play...

                             welles voice (v.o.)
                       (from recorder)
                 ... and your pals, you're fucked...

     hits fast forward... hits play, watching the tone decoder.
     from the recorder, the sound of eddie dialing a number on
     his touch tone phone... and as each tone is heard, a
     corresponding number appears on the decoder's led readout:

                               ...1 212 555 9906...

     the recorder continues, replaying the conversation between
     eddie and dino, while welles studies the green led digits.

                             welles
                       (quiet, to himself)
                 two one two.
