     int.  basement -- day

     welles enters from the garage, gun up.  the dank basement is
     small.  a pile of laundry lies on the floor near a washing
     machine. 

     sheets hang off several clothes lines strung across two
     metal poles.  welles leads with his gun...

     he moves around the sheets, looking behind them.  there's a
     wooden staircase leading upstairs.  welles starts up,
     treading lightly, trying not to make a sound...
