     int.  airplane, coach -- night -- montage

     the cabin's half-full, dark.  passengers sleep.  under the
     only illuminated reading light, welles reads the photocopied
     diary.  mary's voice is a again a flat monotone...

                             mary's voice (v.o.)
                       (as welles reads)
                 "dear diary.  i have a big math test
                 tomorrow.  i have to get better
                 grades.  how come everybody does
                 better than me?  kathy doesn't even
                 study and she gets b's.  two boys
                 got in a fight after school today.
                 one boy knocked the other boy's
                 tooth out, at least that's what it
                 looked like.  his nose and mouth
                 were bleeding all over the place..."
