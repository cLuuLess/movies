     int.  mathews house, mary's room -- day

     mrs. mathews enters.  welles follows. 

     this was the girl's room, exactly as she left it -- posters
     of actors on the wall, many stuffed animals on the pink
     sheets of the carefully made bed.  perfectly preserved.

                             mrs mathews
                 this is her room.

     welles looks around, uncomfortable.
     shelves have pictures of mary with female friends, a
     collection of ceramic figurines of clowns and animals.

                             mrs mathews
                 the police made a wreck of it, but
                 i put it back exactly how it was.
                 just how she likes it.

     welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a desk
     where there are six brightly wrapped gifts.

                             mrs mathews

                 those are for her birthday.  one for
                 every year she's missed.  they'll be
                 waiting for her when she comes back. 

     welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide
     it.  he backs to the door, looks at his watch...

                             welles
                 i... i shouldn't take anymore of
                 your time.  maybe we can finish
                 tomorrow.  i'll call tomorrow...

                             mrs mathews
                 okay.
