     int.  eddie's living room -- day

     welles returns.  eddie's on the floor, wriggling.  welles
     drops the thomas guide on the coffee table, picks eddie up,
     throws him back onto the couch.

                             eddie
                 i'm gonna kill you.

                             welles
                 don't bore me with that bullshit.

                             eddie
                 how'd you find me here?

     welles punches eddie in the ear.

                             welles
                 don't ask questions.

                             eddie
                 fuck you! 

     welles punches eddie in the same ear.  eddie's hurting.
     welles rubs his aching knuckles.

                             welles
                 starting to recognize a pattern?

                             eddie
                 what do you want?

                             welles
                 who is machine?

                             eddie
                 i don't know...

                             welles
                 i want his name.

                             eddie
                 i told you, i don't know.

                             welles 
                 i will never get tired of hurting
                 you, eddie, so you might want to
                 change your attitude.

                             eddie
                 what the fuck am i gonna protect
                 that freak for?  he was dino's boy,
                 not mine.  he shows up with his mask
                 on, leaves with his mask on.  nobody
                 knows.

     welles kicks junk off a chair, sits, takes out his gun.

                             welles
                 okay, we'll come back to that.  so,
                 six years ago a guy contacts you,
                 through the classifieds, over the
                 phone, however he does it.  it's
                 longdale, looking for a snuff film.
                 and you, entrepreneur that you are,
                 tell him you can hook him up.

                             eddie
                 yeah, the fucking lawyer.

                             welles
                 told him you could get him a snuff
                 film.

                             eddie
                 yeah.

                             welles
                 how much did he pay you?

                             eddie
                 thirty thousand each, that fucking
                 cocksucker.

                             welles
                 that's all?  thirty each.  that's
                 all it took for you to murder her?

                             eddie
                 it was a lot of fucking money.

     welles stands and paces, despairing.  he picks up a lamp and
     throws it, shatters a mirror, keeps pacing...

                             welles
                 so... you brought dino in, and he
                 brought machine.  and, one day, a
                 girl walked into your office because
                 you had an ad in the paper for
                 models.  and she never walked out.

                             eddie
                 something like that.

                             welles
                 what did you do, knock her out,
                 shoot her up... ?

                             eddie
                 what the fuck do you want from me?

                             welles
                 i want to know.  i want to know
                 exactly what you did to her!

                             eddie
                 fuck you then, you want to know?  i
                 talked her up, told her how
                 beautiful she was, told her she was
                 gonna be a star.  i told her i was
                 gonna get her a screen test, and
                 while i'm doing that, i got her a
                 soda and dropped a mickey.  when it
                 was dark enough, i rang dino and
                 told him it was go time, i put her
                 in the trunk of my car and we went
                 and we fucking did it.  that's what
                 happened.  she's dead.  she's been
                 dead a long fucking time.  nobody
                 fucking cares!

     welles puts down his gun, picks up the thomas guide, holding
     it in both hands, swings -- slams eddie across the face...

     eddie's stunned, lips bleeding.  he faces forward.

                             eddie
                 you wanted to know, now you know.

     welles swings the thomas guide -- pounds eddie's face again.

     welles drops the thomas guide in a chair, picks up his gun,
     leaves the room...
