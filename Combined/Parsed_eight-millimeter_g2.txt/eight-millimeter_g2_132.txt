     int.  adjacent office, 9th floor -- day

     empty office.  welles is let in by a disinterested landlord.
     welles gives a cursory look around, goes to the windows and
     opens the blinds.

     these windows afford an excellent view of the blue building
     across the street, at about 8th floor level.

                             welles 
                 this is better. 
                       (turns to landlord) 
                 this will be fine.
