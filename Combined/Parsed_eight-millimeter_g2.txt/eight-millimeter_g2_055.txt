     int.  welles' room -- day -- montage

     welles sits with the projector on, watching the film again.

                             welles (v.o., cont)
                 there were three men.  two are
                 obvious; the man in the mask and the
                 man running the camera, but i caught
                 a glimpse of a third man in a
                 mirror.  it's nothing that can be
                 used for identification, but he was
                 there, watching...

     on the wall: masked man touches the girl's mouth, presses
     his lips to hers.  masked man backs away, leaving frame,
     till the camera moves to find masked man standing at a table
     with three large bowie knifes laid out...

     welles notices something, puts the projector on freeze frame.

                             welles (v.o., cont)
                 so, there were three.  they would
                 have kept it small, wouldn't have
                 let anyone in on it they didn't have
                 to.  that's all for now... except,
                 i feel i should tell you... with
                 this looking like it happened at
                 least five or six years ago...

     welles walks to the frozen image on the wall.  it shows the
     masked man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.

                             welles (v.o., cont)
                 well, it's not very likely we'll
                 ever find out who this girl was. 
                       (listens) 
                 i will, i'll keep trying. goodbye.

     v.o. phone call ends with the sound of the phone hanging up.

     on the wall: there's a dark spot on masked man's hand, on
     the arch between his index finger and thumb.  grainy and
     hard to make out, but looks like a small tattoo.
