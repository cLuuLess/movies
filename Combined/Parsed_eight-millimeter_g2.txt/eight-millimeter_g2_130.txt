     int.  wilshire office building, 8th floor hall -- day

     welles comes out a stairwell door, catching his breath.  a
     couple of secretaries wait for the elevator.  welles moves
     down the hall, around a corner.

     each office door has a window of pebbled, translucent glass.
     there's a "dental office," "wilson travel cruises," and at
     the end of the hall, "celebrity films inc., eddie poole,
     professional casting and distribution, suite 804."

     welles heads back the way he came.
