     int.  eddie's house, stairway -- day

     welles enters slow, pockets the tools, takes out his gun.
     follow him up the stairs, into a hallway, past a laundry
     room with washer and dryer, into a living room...

     welles sweeps the room with his gun, wired.  eddie's house
     is predictably a trash heap, strewn with videos, magazines,
     dirty dishes and fast food remnants.  welles moves on...
