     int.  celebrity films office -- day

     welles pushes broken glass out of the way, reaches in to
     open the door.  the office has been cleaned out, trash on
     the floor, desk drawers hanging open and empty, shelves
     empty, posters gone...

     welles grabs one of the file cabinets, pulls it open, finds
     it empty, pulls it all the way out and throws it.
