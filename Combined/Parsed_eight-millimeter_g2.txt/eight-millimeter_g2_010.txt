     int.  airplane, coach -- night 

     the familiar drone of flight.  welles is shoehorned into his
     aisle seat, using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal.

     an older woman arrives in the aisle.  welles picks up his
     tray, closes his tray table, unbuckling his seatbelt,
     struggling to get up... finally successful, balancing his
     tray, letting the woman in to the window seat. 

                             older woman 
                 thank you. 

     welles nods, forcing a smile, sitting back down.  he returns
     to toiling over his miniature supper.
