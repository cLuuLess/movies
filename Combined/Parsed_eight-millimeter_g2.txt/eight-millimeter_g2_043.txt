     int.  missing persons archive, offices -- day 

     small.  cubicles.  employees work phones and computers.
     bulletin boards are covered in family photos, polaroids and
     familiar "have you seen me?" missing person/children posters.

     in one cubicle, welles opens his billfold, shows his
     identification: a laminated "licensed investigator,
     commonwealth of pennsylvania", with welles' photo...

     the director of the center, a tired looking official in
     bifocals, studies the card.  welles sits.

                             director 
                 what can i do for you, mr. welles?

                             welles 
                 call me tom.

                             director 
                 alright, tom.

                             welles
                 what i'd like, very simply, is
                 access to your archive.  and, now i
                 understand this isn't something you
                 normally do for private citizens...

                             director 
                 there are reasons for the way we do
                 things here.

                             welles 
                 absolutely.  of course i'll abide by
                 whatever decision you make, but i'd
                 appreciate if you'll hear me out... 

     the director sits back in his chair.

                             welles 
                 few days ago, i was contacted by a
                 couple living in philadelphia, a
                 doctor and his wife.  what happened
                 was they picked up a young girl
                 hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
                 philadelphia, started up a
                 conversation with this girl, she
                 looked homeless, seemed about
                 eighteen maybe.  they convinced her
                 to let them buy her a meal in the
                 city.  nice kid, mature, didn't have
                 much to say, but they got a sense
                 she's a runaway, so all through
                 dinner the doctor's working on her,
                 trying to convince her that at the
                 very least she should pick up a
                 telephone.  not surprisingly, she
                 ate her food, excused herself...
                       (snaps fingers)
                 that's the last they saw her.  the
                 reason they came to me for help, the
                 reason i'm coming to you, is we had
                 a friend of mine in the department
                 work up a sketch...
                       (shows the police artist
                        sketch he photocopied)
                 they want to see if i can i.d. this
                 girl, somehow pass along a message
                 to let the parents know the kid's
                 alive, doing alright.

                             director 
                 why not go to the n.c.i.c. or
                 n.c.m.e.c.? 

                             welles 
                 i figured you share information. 

                             director 
                 we do. 

                             welles 
                 for whatever reasons i thought you
                 might be more receptive.

                             director 
                 why don't they come to me? 

                             welles 
                 this doctor and wife, they're nice
                 people, but they don't want to get
                 too involved.  they're not trying to
                 have the parents come looking for
                 the girl either. 
                 you and i both know sometimes, not
                 often, but sometimes there's real
                 reasons why a kid'll run. 
                 molestation, whatever.  besides
                 that, the girl's probably eighteen,
                 so she's legal.

                             director 
                 i'm not so sure about this. 

                             welles 
                 they're putting themselves in place
                 of this kid's parents and thinking
                 they'd want to hear their girl's
                 okay, even if that's all they hear. 

                             director
                 i can give you my card, if your
                 clients want to call me... 

     welles accepts a card, disappointed.

                             welles 
                 they were pretty clear they didn't
                 want this coming back on them.

                             director 
                 well, that's all i can do.  sorry. 

     welles looks at the director, stands, hangs his head.

                             welles 
                 who knows... maybe she's already
                 given her parents a call, right?

     welles leaves.
