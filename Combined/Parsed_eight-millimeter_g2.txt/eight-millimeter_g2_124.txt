     int.  mission youth hostel, storage area -- day

     in a basement corner, welles watches as the nun uses keys to
     open the door of a chain-link storage cage.  the cage is
     full of junk, boxes, lamps, stacks of chairs.

                             nun
                 she lived here for only about a
                 month, if i recall correctly.  she
                 didn't return one night.  she never
                 came back.  i didn't know what to
                 think...

     the nun enters the cage, pushes old boxes out of her way,
     looks up a cob-web covered metal shelves.

                             nun
                 do you know what happened to her?

                             welles
                 i'm trying to find out.  she was a
                 runaway.  i'm looking into it for
                 her parents.

     the nun sees what she wants, finds a step ladder, tries to
     open it.  welles comes to help her.

                             nun
                       (pointing on shelf)
                 can you get that down for me?

     welles climbs the ladder, points at boxes...

                             nun
                 no, the next shelf... there...

     welles takes down a small suitcase.  it's covered in dust.
     he climbs down the ladder with it.

                             welles
                 what is this?

                             nun
                 those are her belongings.

                             welles
                 her belongings?

                             nun
                 that's her suitcase.  i had
                 forgotten it, till you showed me
                 her picture.

     welles puts the suitcase down, examines the luggage tag:
     "mary anne mathews," no address.  welles looks to the nun. 

                             welles
                 whatever possessed you to keep this
                 all this time?

                             nun
                 she was the kindest, sweetest girl
                 you'd ever want to meet.  oh, i
                 adored her.  i supposed i always
                 hoped she'd be back.  after a time,
                 all i could do was pray she had
                 moved on to better things.  can you
                 get this suitcase to her parents, if
                 you think it's appropriate?

                             welles
                 i'll do what i can.
