     welles knocks, clipboard in hand.  a sad, middle-aged woman
     answers, mrs. mathews, looking through the screen door.

                             mrs mathews
                 yes... ?

                             welles
                       (smiles)
                 hello, mrs. mathews, my name's
                 thomas jones, i'm a state licensed
                 investigator...

     welles holds up his identification only long enough for mrs.
     mathews to see it looks official.

                             welles
                 i've been hired as an independent
                 contractor by the u.s. resource
                 center for missing persons as part
                 of an internal audit.  if you have
                 any time over the next few days, i'd
                 like to make an appointment to ask
                 some questions about the
                 disappearance of your daughter.

                             mrs mathews
                 i don't understand, who are... ?

                             welles
                 i'm sorry, let me explain, the
                 r.c.m.p. is a support organization
                 and archive, not unlike the center
                 for missing and exploited children
                 in washington.  i'm sure you've
                 dealt with them before?

                             mrs mathews
                 yes, but... 

                             welles 
                 these volunteer organizations are
                 sort of interconnected, functioning
                 hand in hand with law enforcement.
                 the r.c.m.p. brought me in to review
                 their investigations...
                       (holds up clipboard)
                 ... fact-check their records, see if
                 there's anything they missed,
                 anything they should be doing
                 different.  i'm here for a few days,
                 before i head back up to virginia.
                 these reports go to the justice
                 department eventually.  i spoke to
                 your f.b.i. contact a few days ago,
                 uh...

     welles pretends to look for the name on a jiffy lube page...

                             welles 
                 what was the name... ? i've got it
                 here somewhere...

                             mrs mathews
                 neil... neil cole.

                             welles
                       (pretends he found it)
                 right, agent cole told me he'd call
                 and let you know to expect me.  he
                 didn't call?

                             mrs mathews
                 no.

                             welles
                       (looking on legal pad)
                 well, i'm following up on your
                 daughter, mary, height; five four,
                 weight; hundred ten pounds, brown
                 eyes, blonde hair.  born april 24,
                 1976.  missing june 11th, 1992.  a
                 runaway, that's how she's listed.
                 is this information correct... ?

     mrs. mathews stares, nods.

                             welles
                 i'm sorry, i know this isn't easy.
                 is there a more convenient time... ?
                       (looks at watch)
                 can i buy you lunch, would that be
                 alright?

     mrs. mathews looks him up and down.
