     int.  motel room -- morning

     the phone book's open on the desk with nearly a hundred
     hospital phone numbers crossed out.

                             welles (o.s.)
                 ... abdominal wound.  you'd know him
                 if you saw him... 

     light cuts into the room from between the curtains.  welles
     paces, carrying the phone with him, weary.

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 he's a body-builder, stands just
                 under six feet...

     welles stops in his track, listening, suddenly attentive.

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 that's right... covered in acne.
                 that's him, that's the guy.  listen,
                 we, uh... we think he filed a bogus
                 report on this stabbing, gave us a
                 false name and address...
                       (listens)
                 yes, i'll hold.

     welles goes to the desk, takes out his notepad.  he starts
     feeling his pockets for his pen, can't find it, telephone
     book, searching, looks under the desk...

     welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor.

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 yes... yes.
                       (sits, writing in pad)
                 christopher higgins.  thirty-
                 fifteen, thirty fifth street.
                 where?  astoria, queens.

     welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad.
