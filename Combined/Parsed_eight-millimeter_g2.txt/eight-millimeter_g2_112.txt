     ext.  downtown streets -- night

     the only people on the street are homeless and shady
     characters.  welles' car makes its way to a big deserted
     parking lot.  there are a few cars parked in one corner.

     welles parks near the other cars and gets out.  max stands
     against a chain link fence.  welles goes to meet him.

                             max
                 come on.

     max leads the way, across the lot, towards dark alleyways.
