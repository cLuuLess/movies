     ext.  welles' house, backyard -- day 

     sunny day.  welles wears tan khakis, t-shirt and fishing
     cap, mowing his lawn with his roaring lawnmower.  welles'
     yard is modest, surrounding his modest split level suburban
     one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards.

     welles turns the lawnmower, stopping to mop his brow.  one
     of his neighbors is repainting a back porch.  the neighbor
     waves.  welles waves, resumes mowing.
