     int.  mathews house, kitchen -- morning

     welles sits at the kitchen table.  mrs. mathews makes
     coffee.  the home's decor is cheap and flowery.

                             mrs mathews 
                 we weren't religious.  we never
                 forced religion down her throat,
                 like i've seen some parents do to
                 their kids.  we never made her go to
                 church.  but, after mary was gone,
                 that's when i got religious.

     mrs. mathews brings two cups of coffee, sits.

                             mrs mathews
                 doesn't make much sense, does it?
                 when everything's happy, when life's
                 fine and you have every reason to
                 believe there's a god, you don't
                 bother.  then, something horrible
                 happens... that's when you start
                 praying all the time.  that's when
                 you start going to church.

                             welles
                 we're all like that.

                             mrs mathews
                 are you religious?

                             welles
                 no.

                             mrs mathews
                 you should be.

     mrs. mathews drinks coffee, stares into the cup.

                             welles
                 i've got what i need for my report.
                 there is... there is one thing that
                 bothers me though.

                             mrs mathews
                 what? 

                             welles
                 it's not really my place, but it's
                 not easy for me to set aside the
                 private detective part of me either.
                 see, i know a little about missing
                 persons.  when kids run, they almost
                 always leave a note.  it's guilt.
                 they want to say goodbye.

                             mrs mathews
                 there wasn't one.  the police looked.

                             welles
                 do you think the police did a good
                 job?

                             mrs mathews
                 i don't know.  i think so.

                             welles
                 it is possible... and i know this
                 isn't something you want to hear.
                 your daughter may have tried to hide
                 a note where she thought you would
                 eventually find it, but where she
                 knew your husband would never find
                 it.  she might have wanted to tell
                 you something...

                             mrs mathews
                 no.  you don't have any reason to
                 think that...

                             welles
                 if the police focused their search
                 in her room, her belongings, well
                 that'd be only natural, but they may
                 have been looking in the wrong place.

     mrs. mathews is getting upset.

                             mrs mathews
                 how... how can you say that to me...?

                             welles
                 will you let me look?

                             mrs mathews
                 my husband never laid a hand on her.
                 she would have told me... she would
                 have told me...

                             welles 
                 you're probably right, and i
                 probably won't find anything.
                 i don't have a right to ask this,
                 and you can kick me out of your
                 house if you want, but this is my
                 profession and there's a part of me
                 that can't let it go.  police are
                 just as human as you or i.  they
                 could have missed something.  they
                 probably didn't.
                       (pause)
                 wouldn't you rather know?

     mrs. mathews thinks about it, tortured, shakes her head sadly.

                             mrs mathews
                 go ahead and look if you want.  i
                 don't care what you do.

     mrs. mathews gets up and walks out of the room.
