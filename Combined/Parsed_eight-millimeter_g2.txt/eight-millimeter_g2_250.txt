     int.  welles' car -- night

     welles still watches the house.  there's a light on in one
     of the second floor windows, curtains closed.

     welles yawns, shaking his head, trying to stay awake.

     at the quaint house, a light comes on in the front picture
     window.  looks like a living room or dining room.  the old
     woman comes to sit at a table.

     welles takes binoculars off the front seat...

     through binoculars

     the old woman says something to someone we cannot see.
     she's at the dinner table, with a place setting in front of
     her.  after a moment, someone joins her...

     it's machine, you can tell by his bulk, by his huge
     forearms.  the lacy curtains of the window block part of our
     view, so we never see his face.

     in the car

     welles lowers the binoculars, still watching.

     through the window across the street, machine can be seen
     putting a plate of food in front of the old woman.  the old
     woman smiles up at him, says something.

     machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches,
     then goes back to stand beside the old woman.

     machine is seen from behind, bends to give the old woman a
     kiss on the cheek, then leaves the room.  the old woman
     starts to eat.

                                              dissolve to:
