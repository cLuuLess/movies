     int.  hollywood hotel -- day -- montage

     welles' suitcase is open on the bed.  welles sits in a chair
     with his feet up, sweating in the heat, reading the diary.

                             mary's voice (v.o.)
                       (as welles reads)
                 "... we're reading the great gatsby
                 in english class.  it's the story of
                 this guy who has lots of fancy
                 parties and all his friends come
                 around and party with him, but later
                 when he dies nobody comes to his
                 funeral.  someone said there's a
                 movie about it, but i looked in the
                 video store and it wasn't there."

     welles flips pages, further back in the diary...

                             mary's voice (v.o.)
                       (as welles reads)
                 "dear diary.  i started my first job
                 last week working part time at price
                 mart department store..."
