     int.  eddie's bedroom -- day

     eddie's throwing clothing into a suitcase, hurried.  welles
     comes into the doorway, taking aim, edging forward.

                             welles
                 hello, eddie.

     eddie spins, startled.

                             welles
                 put your hands on your head.

     eddie looks out of the corner of his eye... to his gun.

                             welles
                 put your hands behind your head,
                 lock your finger together, get down
                 on your knees.

     eddie does as commanded, gets to his knees.  welles moves
     towards him, very nervous, white-knuckling the gun.
     he kicks eddie in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             welles
                 i owe you a few.

     welles kicks again.
