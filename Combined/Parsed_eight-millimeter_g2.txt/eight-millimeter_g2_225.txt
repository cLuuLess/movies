     ext.  deserted roadway -- night

     heavy forests border close to the road.  welles' car travels
     alone, headlights on, slowing as it comes to an overgrown
     gravel driveway with a rusty chain strung across it.

     in the car

     welles leans forward to look up at an old sign of broken
     neon and peeled paint: "big bear motor lodge."

     welles pulls forward, puts the car in reverse...

     on the roadway

     welles' car backs up, angling, till the rear bumper comes
     against the chain, backing... till the chain snaps.

     welles' car pulls forward across the empty roadway, turns
     around... accelerates down the overgrown driveway...
