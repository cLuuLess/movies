     int.  welles' car -- day

     welles gets behind the wheel.  longdale looks at his watch.

                             longdale
                 you almost went over your limit.

                             welles
                 fuck you.

     welles puts the car in gear and drives. 

                             longdale
                 give me the film.

                             welles 
                 you'll get it when we get there.

     longdale puts the gun to the side of welles' head.

                             longdale
                 give me the film.

                             welles
                 go ahead, shoot me.  then try
                 driving to brooklyn with my brains
                 all over the windshield.

     welles keeps driving.  longdale sits back, stewing.
