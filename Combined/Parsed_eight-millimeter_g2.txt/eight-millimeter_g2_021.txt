     int.  welles' house, kitchen -- night 

     dinner.  welles and amy eat at the kitchen table with cindy
     in a high chair.  amy feeds cindy between bites.  welles is
     still in his league shirt. 

                             amy 
                 you think you'll have time for the
                 water heater this weekend?

                             welles 
                 sure.  i'll call the guy. 

                             amy 
                 you're not using the same guy who
                 tried to fix it? 

                             welles 
                 i'm not using him again for
                 anything.  he was worthless. 
                       (eating)
                 you have bridge here saturday? 

                             amy 
                 betty's out of town so we're playing
                 next week. 

     welles nods, eating.  he watches amy feed cindy.  the phone
     starts ringing.  welles goes to answer it. 

                             welles 
                       (into phone) 
                 hello.  yes... could you hold on a
                 minute...?

     welles hands the phone to amy, pats cindy's head as he heads
     downstairs, through the living room...
