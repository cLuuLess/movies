     int.  christian house, adjoining room -- night

     silence.  mrs. christian sits waiting, troubled.
     the door to the dining room opens and welles enters from the
     dark, visibly shaken.  mrs. christian watches him, her
     sorrow now shared.

                             welles
                 you... you need to go to the police. 

                             mrs christian 
                 i told you i can't, not yet. 

                             welles
                 you don't have any other choice. 

                             mrs christian 
                       (stands, shakes her head) 
                 no.  for me to live with the ruin of
                 my husband's name, i need know that
                 whoever did this will be punished.
                 if you can find them, i will take
                 their names to the police.  i'll say
                 my husband confessed on his death
                 bed. i'll say i didn't have courage
                 to come forward at first...

                             welles 
                 it won't work like that.

                             mrs christian 
                 any evidence you collect can be
                 given to the police later,
                 anonymously.  i've thought about it
                 and there's no other way.  if you
                 can't find them... if the only thing
                 that comes from this film is that
                 this is all my husband will be
                 remembered for, well i can't let
                 that happen.  i'm telling you i
                 won't.  if there's no chance that
                 poor girl's memory can be served,
                 then i'll just have to spend my last
                 days trying to forget her. 

     welles sits, rests his head in his hands. 

                             welles 
                 i deal in divorce cases.  corporate
                 investigations...

                             mrs christian 
                 you've found missing persons before. 

                             welles 
                 nothing remotely like this. 

                             mrs christian 
                 i know what i'm asking.  your
                 compensation will be appropriate to
                 the risk.  you'll need cash to buy
                 information, and i'll provide it.
                       (pause)
                 i feel responsible, mr. welles.
                       (pause)
                 you saw what he did to her.

     welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the
     dining room where the projector sits idle.
