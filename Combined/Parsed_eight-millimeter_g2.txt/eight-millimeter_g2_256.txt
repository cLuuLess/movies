     int.  dining room/living room -- day

     welles slowly opens the swinging door, entering from the
     kitchen, sweeping the room with his gun.  no sign of
     machine.  the whole house is dead quiet.

     he passes the dining room table where he watched the old
     woman eat last night... passes fake paintings on the walls,
     of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes... moves into
     the living room area...

     yellow shag carpet.  a pink sofa is covered in clear
     plastic, facing an old television in faux-wooden cabinet.
     welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor.

     welles creeps up the stairs...
