     int.  machine's bedroom -- day

     welles pushes the door in, enters warily.  there's a
     constant scratching heard.  the room is like a child's,
     except the bed is huge.  shelves are full of boardgames and
     comic books.  a danzig poster on the wall.  there's a record
     player with lp records beside it.  a record turns on the
     turntable, the needle caught at the center, scratching...

     welles eases his way over to the closet... reaching...
     pulls it open, steps back, gun up.  nothing.  just clothing.
