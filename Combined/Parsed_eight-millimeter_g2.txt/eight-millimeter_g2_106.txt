     is silhouetted.  he wears headphones, listening...

                             welles' voice (v.o.)
                       (through headphones)
                 ... i've got a feeling the person
                 i'm looking for came out here and
                 got swallowed up by the place.

                             amy's voice (v.o.)
                       (through headphone)

                 come back...

                             welles' voice (v.o.)
                       (through headphone)

                 soon, believe me.  it won't be long.

                             amy's voice (v.o.)
                       (through headphone)
