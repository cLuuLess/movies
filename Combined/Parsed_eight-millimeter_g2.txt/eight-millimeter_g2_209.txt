     int.  wilshire office building, 8th floor hall -- day

     elevator doors open and welles gets off.  he moves down the
     hall, around a corner, heading to "celebrity films."

     welles tries the door knob, finds it locked.  he looks
     around, takes two steps back, kicks forward... smashes the
     translucent glass of the door...
