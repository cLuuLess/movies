     int.  welles' house, kitchen -- night

     cindy's in her high-chair by the table.  amy's at the
     kitchen sink, washing vegetables, peeling potatoes.

     welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her.  amy turns
     to look at him.  it breaks her heart to see him so wounded,
     but she forces herself to continue working in the sink.

                             amy
                 how much forgiveness do you think i
                 have in me?

     welles comes into the kitchen, stands beside cindy, puts his
     hand out and clasp's cindy's tiny hand.

                             welles
                 i can't talk about it yet... not
                 yet.

     amy keeps peeling potatoes, refuses to look at him.  welles
     looks down at cindy, pats cindy's head, looks back at amy.
     he stands looking at amy for a long moment.
