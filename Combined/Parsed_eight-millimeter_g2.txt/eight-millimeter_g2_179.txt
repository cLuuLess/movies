     int.  welles' car -- continuous

     welles is at the wheel.  longdale is in the passenger seat,
     gun held in his lap.

                             welles
                 you were the middleman, am i right?
                 old man christian wasn't about to go
                 shopping for a snuff film himself.

                             longdale
                 wouldn't exactly have been possible
                 for a man of his stature.

                             welles
                 so, he sent you, gave you the money,
                 his errand-boy.  and if you refused,
                 it wasn't like you could tell anyone
                 your pervert boss just asked you to
                 get him a snuff film.  that's the
                 beauty of lawyer/client privilege.

                             longdale
                 that's trust.  mr. christian trusted
                 me implicitly.

                             welles
                 must have paid you a lot, for you to
                 risk everything.  would've had to
                 have cut yourself a real nice piece
                 of money.

                             longdale
                 i was well compensated.

                             welles
                 that's why you got scared when mrs.
                 christian hired me.  you knew about
                 the film, figured it had to be in
                 that safe.  how'd you find me?

                             longdale
                 never mind how i found you.

                             welles
                 followed me... must have freaked out
                 when you saw me closing in on your
                 buddies...

                             longdale
                 they're no friends of mine.

                             welles
                 except, you're willing commit murder
                 with them.

                             longdale
                 none of this would be happening if
                 you would have left it alone.  if
                 you weren't digging up a girl who
                 died six years ago.  a girl no one
                 even remembers.

                             welles
                 mary anne mathews, that was her
                 name.  her mom remembers her.

     welles looks at longdale.

                             welles
                 you found these smut dealers and
                 asked to buy a snuff film, right?
                 wanted them to find you one.  well,
                 they didn't find you one, longdale,
                 they went out and made you one...

                             longdale
                 shut up.

                             welles
                 mary anne mathews was alive till you
                 paid money to have her murdered.

                             longdale
                 shut your mouth and drive!

                             welles
                 did it get him off, huh, watching
                 them cut her up?  tell me, because
                 i really want to understand.  did he
                 jerk off to it?  you watch it with
                 him, sit there giving him a handjob
                 while you both watched... ?

     longdale jams the gun against welles' side.

                             longdale 
                 you're making me very angry.

                             welles
                 just tell me.  tell me some more of
                 the secrets you and christian
                 shared. what kind of degenerate
                 pervert was he really?  what the
                 fuck did he want with a snuff film?

                             longdale
                 you're asking me why?

                             welles
                 i'm asking.

     longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.

                             longdale
                 a man like mr. christian, a great
                 man... all his money, all his
                 power... a man who attained
                 everything there was to attain...

                             welles
                 why did he buy a film of some poor,
                 lost girl getting butchered?

                             longdale
                 isn't it incredibly obvious?

                             welles
                 enlighten me.

                             longdale
                 because he could.  he did it because
                 he could.
                       (pause)
                 what other reason were you looking
                 for?

     welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed.
