     ext.  mathews house, fayetteville suburb -- day

     a tree-lined street of poor, boxy homes.  welles' car parks
     in front of one house with a neglected lawn.

     in the car

     welles, clean shaven, picks a clipboard with a file folder
     and his legal pad on it, thumbs pages.  he drums his
     fingers, opens the glove compartment, pulls out the car's
     registration, other papers and "jiffy-lube" service reports,
     uses them to pad the file.

     welles takes a bottle of cologne from his pocket.  he
     considers it, opens the bottle, applies cologne to his neck.
