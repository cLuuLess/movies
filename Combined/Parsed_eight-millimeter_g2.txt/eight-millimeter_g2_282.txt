     int.  welles' house, cindy's room -- day

     amy's in a chair, reading a book, not far from cindy's crib.
     cindy's asleep.  the front door of the house is heard
     opening and closing from far off in the house.  amy looks up
     momentarily, then returns to reading.

     footsteps can be heard coming through the house, getting
     closer.  amy looks up from her book.  the bedroom door's
     open a crack.  the door slowly pushes open.  welles stands
     there, eyes red from crying.

                             amy
                 tom... ?

     welles comes into the room, stands before amy.  he gets to
     his knees, puts his head in amy's lap, wraps his arms around
     her waist.  amy holds him, worried, eyes filling with tears.

                             welles
                 i have to tell you... i have to tell
                 you what happened.  i have to tell
                 you everything, but we can't tell
                 anyone else.  no one else can ever
                 know.

     amy runs her fingers through his hair, bends down to rest
     her head on his back, holding him with her eyes closed.
     welles holds tighter.

                             welles
                 you're all i've got.  you're all
                 i've ever had.
                       (pause)
                 you're the only one who can save me.
