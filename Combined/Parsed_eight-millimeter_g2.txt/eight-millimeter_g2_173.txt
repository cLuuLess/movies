     ext.  motel courtyard, pool -- night

     horns and traffic are heard.  max and welles sit in lawn
     chairs at the tiny pool.  welles smokes.  max drinks beer.
     they watch an elderly woman in a one piece bathing suit
     climb from the pool and walk to the diving board, diving in.

                             max
                 what's next?

                             welles
                 i'm trying to figure that out
                 myself.  i have to see machine
                 without his mask.

                             max
                 still don't want to tell me what
                 you're doing?

                             welles
                 nope.

     the old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
     welles takes out a thick envelope, hands it to max.

                             welles
                 this is for you.

     max doesn't understand, opens the envelope, finds about
     fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope.

                             max
                 what's this?

                             welles
                 it's money.  people use it to
                 purchase goods and services.

     max looks at it again, can't believe it.

                             max
                 look... that's awful generous and
                 everything...

                             welles
                 it's not my money.  the woman i got
                 it from is never going to give it a
                 second thought.  let's not make a
                 big deal out of this, okay? 
                       (pause)
                 go be a race car driver.  go run for
                 president.  whatever.

     welles puts his cigarette out, stands.

                             welles
                 i'll see you around.

     welles walks away, heading to his room.  max watches him go,
     doesn't know what to say, looks in the envelope.

     the old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board.
