     ext.  motor lodge -- night -- continuous

     the only sounds come from the night forest.  crickets and
     distant birds.  we can't see anything but the total darkness
     through the open door of the room.  a car is heard, getting
     louder as it passes, fainter as it gets further away.

     finally, welles comes to the doorway, in shock, steadying
     himself against the door frame, shirt and suit spattered
     red.  his gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood.

     welles looks back into the room, backing away.  he turns and
     goes to his car...

     in the car

     welles climbs in the driver's side, shoves his bloody gun
     into his holster, tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his
     shirt, revolted.  he starts the car.
