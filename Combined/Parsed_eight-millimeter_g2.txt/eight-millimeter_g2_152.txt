     ext.  1204 warehouse, soho -- later day

     the sun is low.  less activity on the street.  welles leans
     against a car down the street, smoking a cigarette.

     two women walk this way, both in spiked high heels, dressed
     in cheap, short, formfitting skirts, both carrying duffel
     bags.  they start up the stairs of 1204...

     welles throws his cigarette, walks to follow.

     the women hit the center button.  a buzzer sounds as they
     head inside.  welles hurries up the stairs, catching the
     door before it closes.
