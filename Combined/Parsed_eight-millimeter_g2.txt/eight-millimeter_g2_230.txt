     ext.  motor lodge -- night

     welles pulls the door closed behind him, walks to his car.

     in the car

     welles opens the passenger door and sits, shaken, at his
     wit's end.  he opens the glove compartment, finds
     cigarettes, digs one out and lights it.

     he looks back to the motel room.

     he looks down to the glove compartment, at his cellular
     phone.  after a moment, welles picks up the phone, looks at
     it in his hand.

     in the lot

     welles gets out of the car, gets up on the hood, lays back,
     staring at the sky.  he closes his eyes, smokes.

     welles opens the phone, looks at the illuminated numbers.
     he digs in his suit jacket pocket, takes out his notepad,
     pages through, studies one page.

     welles sits up.  he gathers himself, throws his cigarette,
     dials a number, puts the cellular to his ear, afraid...

                             mrs mathews (v.o.)
                       (from phone)

                             welles

                 silverware.  if you read it, you'll
                 know what i'm telling you is true... 

     welles climbs off the car, paces, aching with misery...

                             mrs mathews (v.o.)
                 what are you talking about... ?

                             welles
                 she went to california, to los
                 angeles... she wanted to start over.
                 she wanted to be an actress...

                             mrs mathews (v.o.)
                 what... ?

     tears comes to welles' eyes.  it's the hardest thing he's
     ever had to do in his entire life.

                             welles
                 mrs. mathews, your daughter is dead.
                 she's dead.

                             mrs mathews
                 who is this... ?

                             welles
                 someone... some men, they took your
                 daughter and they drugged her, and
                 they took her to a motel room...
                 they did terrible things to her...

                             mrs mathews (v.o.)
                 who are you?

                             welles
                 they brought her into the room...
                 one man, he put a knife to her
                 throat and he raped her...

                             mrs mathews
                 no...

                             welles
                 he raped her and...and...and he
                 murdered her...he cut her up with
                 knifes...

                             mrs mathews (v.o.)
                 no... no... no...

                             welles
                 they killed her, and they took her
                 out in the forest somewhere and they
                 buried her...

                             mrs mathews (v.o.)
                 why... why are you doing this to
                 me... ?

                             welles
                 they murdered her, mrs. mathews, i'm
                 sorry.  it happened a month after
                 she ran away.  she's been dead all
                 this time...

     mrs mathews is heard screaming, letting out a chocking sob.
     welles falls back against the car, holds his head, weeping...

                             welles
                 i'm sorry, i'm so sorry... there
                 wasn't anything anyone could do...

     welles pushes disconnect, lowers the phone, drops it to the
     ground, utterly drained.  he puts his forearm over his eyes,
     gasping, sucking air...

     he looks to the motel room, tamping down his sorrow, willing
     it to fuel his rage...

     he takes out his gun, hands unsteady, determined, opens the
     gun and pours the bullets out.  he closes the gun and walks
     towards the motel room...
