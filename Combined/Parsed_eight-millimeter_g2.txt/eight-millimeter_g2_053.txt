     int.  cleveland bar -- night -- montage

     local bar.  welles sits drinking with the archive's
     director, talking, smiling at something the director said.

                             welles (v.o., cont)
                 there don't seen to be many
                 fingerprints on the film itself, but
                 i'm going to have to be careful to
                 leave them intact...
