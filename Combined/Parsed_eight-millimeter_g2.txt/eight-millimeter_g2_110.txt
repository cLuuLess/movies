     int.  welles room -- night

     welles sleeps, despite the stead sound of traffic racing by
     his window.  the phone rings, waking him.  welles looks at
     the clock radio, 2:23am, reaches to answer the phone...

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 ... hello... ?

                             max (v.o.)
                       (from phone)
                 wake up, pops.  your education
                 begins tonight.
