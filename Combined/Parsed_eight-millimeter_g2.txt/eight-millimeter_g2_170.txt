     ext.  manhattan street -- night

     horns blare.  two cars have collided head-on.  a large crowd
     gathers.  one windshield's shattered, blood spattered.  the
     driver is slumped over the wheel, gushing blood.

     on a nearby street corner, welles in on a pay phone.
     heavy metal can be heard filtered through the receiver.

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 so, what do you say?
