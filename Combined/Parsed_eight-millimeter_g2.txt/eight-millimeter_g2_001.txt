     int.  miami airport, terminal -- day

     amongst the weary tourist families and solitary businessmen
     sits tom welles, middle-aged, hair neat, suit crisp and
     gray.  he's eating crackers from a cellophane package,
     sipping soda from a paper cup, watching an arrival gate.

     passengers arrive: the paunchy, graying men of first class
     leading the pack, except for a handsome young republican
     poster boy hurrying along.

     across the terminal

     welles gets up and follows...
