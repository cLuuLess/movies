     int.  welles' house, office -- night

     welles enters his well kept office, turns on a light at the
     desk.  the room is filled with file cabinets and shelves of
     books, hundreds of phone books and a copy machine.  welles
     picks up the phone and cups the receiver. 

                             welles 
                       (shouts upstairs)
                 okay, i've got it.
                       (into phone)
                 hello... sorry, i was switching
                 phones.  it's a pleasure to make
                 your acquaintance, mrs. christian.
                       (listens)
                 yes.  yes, i understand... tomorrow
                 evening should be fine...

     welles listens, clears space on his desk, taking notes.
