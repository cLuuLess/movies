     int.  welles' ford -- day

     welles drives on the highway, groceries in back.  he watches
     the roadway ahead.  there's little traffic.

     welles glances down, turns on the radio.  some classical
     music plays.  welles stares forward through the windshield.

     after a moment, welles turns the radio off.  he drives.  the
     only sound is the drone of the engine and tires.

     welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion, eyes filling with
     tears.  he tries to fight it, but can't help himself.  his
     face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying, letting
     out a loud wail of misery...
