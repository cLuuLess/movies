     int.  bank -- day

     welles comes out from the safe deposit vault, pocketing the
     film, crossing towards the entrance, looking around...

     ... at other customers waiting on line...

     ... at a guard with a gun at his side...

     welles detours, toward one of the loan desks.  the bank
     employee behind the desk is occupied, on the phone.

     as welles moves past the desk, he grabs a pair of scissors
     from a pencil holder and palms it, heading to the door...
