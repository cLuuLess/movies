     int.  brooklyn warehouse -- day

     welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to
     the darkness.  a vast, empty space looms before him.

     in the middle of the warehouse, dino velvet stands, in a
     powder blue suit, holding an archery bow and arrow.

                             dino velvet
                 there you are.  come join us.

     there's a wrought iron bed not far from dino.  machine is
     seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather s+m
     harness and the same wrestling mask as in the snuff film.

     welles gathers his courage, walks towards them.

     dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the
     warehouse.  he stands by a table with a quiver of arrows
     propped up.  he shoots an arrow toward a large target...

     strikes the target dead center, bull's-eye.  as welles gets
     closer, he notices several things ... 

     ... a 16mm camera mounted on a tripod, facing the bed, along
     with several movie lights

     ... several bowie knifes are laid out on the table, beside
     a pair of handcuffs...

     ... machine is watching him as he approaches...

     welles stops, not far from dino and machine, but keeping his
     distance.  dino's still firing arrows at the target.
     machine's still staring at welles.

                             welles
                       (to machine)
                 hello.

     machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.

                             dino velvet
                 you brought the money?

                             welles
                       (takes out envelope)
                 right here.

     dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's-eye, then
     turns to look at welles with a smile.

                             dino velvet
                 excellent.

                             welles
                 where are the women?

                             dino velvet
                 they should be here any minute.

     welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the
     table, beside bowie knifes.  he's sweating.

                             welles
                       (of the knifes)
                 what are these for?

                             dino velvet
                 hmm?  oh, the knifes?  they're just
                 props.  nice, aren't they?

                             welles
                 sure.

     dino walks across towards the target.

                             dino velvet
                 machine and i were just talking
                 about knifes.  the beauty of
                 knifes...

     dino pulls arrows from the target.

                             dino velvet
                 he was saying how fascinated he is
                 by their simple ability to be sharp.
                 the ability of a piece of metal to
                 be so thin that it is almost
                 nothing...

     dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the
     quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.

                             dino velvet
                 so close to nothingness that it cuts
                 with minimum effort, because it's so
                 non-intrusive.  flesh is fooled.  it
                 blooms open as the blade widens, but
                 by then it's too late, because the
                 knife's already doing its pure,
                 simple damage.

     dino shoots another arrow to the target.
     a clatter attracts welles attention.  far across the
     warehouse, a delivery door rolls upwards.  a car with tinted
     windows drives in...

     the man who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays
     behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...

                             dino velvet
                 ah, ours guests have arrived.

     machine stands.  he is a giant.
     welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now.

     the car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target.

     dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at
     the target... turns, aims the arrow at welles.

                             dino velvet
                 mister welles... would you be so
                 kind as to remove any firearms from
                 your person?

                             welles
                 what are you... ?

                             dino velvet
                 take out your gun!

     welles brings his hand towards his holster...

                             dino velvet
                 slowly.  let me see it.

     welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse...

     the silhouetted man is walking this way.  can't tell who he
     is yet.  machine heads the direction of the parked car.

                             dino velvet
                 empty the gun onto the table, very
                 carefully.

                             welles
                 look, i don't know what this...

                             dino velvet
                 shut up, cunt!  do exactly as i say,
                 or i'll put this arrow through your
                 throat.

     welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table.

     the silhouetted man's getting closer.  it's eddie poole.

                             eddie
                 is that him?

                             dino velvet
                       (to welles)
                 put the gun down, take the
                 handcuffs.  handcuff yourself to the
                 bed.

     welles obeys, walks to the bed.
     welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the
     other cuff around his wrist. dino puts down the bow and arrow.

                             dino velvet
                       (still to welles)
                 didn't know what to make of you at
                 first, and you certainly had eddie
                 on pins and needles.  but, lo and
                 behold, from out of the blue came an
                 old business acquaintance to explain
                 everything...

     welles looks across to the car...
     the sinister lawyer, longdale, gets out from behind the
     wheel and hands the keys to machine, walks this way...

                             eddie
                 this is the fucker?  motherfucker,
                 doesn't look like anything...

     eddie walks around the bed, studies welles.  welles watches
     him.  eddie goes to stand behind welles, rushes forward...

     punches welles in the side of the head.
     welles goes down, clutching his face.

                             eddie
                 doesn't look like shit.

     eddie pulls welles to his feet, throws him against the bed,
     frisking him from head to toe.

     longdale comes to stand beside dino, nervous, taking out a
     tiny handgun and pointing it at welles.  welles looks up,
     holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.

                             dino velvet
                     (to welles)
                 you remember mr. longdale, don't you?

                             welles
                 i remember him.

                             longdale
                 let's get this over with.

                             dino velvet
                 fine idea.

     dino comes to sit on the bed beside welles.

                             dino velvet
                 you're going to go get the film you
                 received from mrs. christian, bring
                 it here and put it in my hand.  and
                 to save time, so we make this as
                 efficient as possible, there's an
                 incentive...

     dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp whistle.

     across the warehouse, machine uses the car keys to open the
     trunk of the car, pulls someone out...

     it's max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly
     conscious.  machine throws him to the floor.

                             welles
                 no...

     welles tries to go towards max, yanked back by the
     handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.

                             dino velvet
                 friend of yours?

                             welles
                 look, he's got nothing to do with
                 this... let him go...

                             dino velvet
                 can you guess what i'm going to say
                 next?

                             welles
                 he doesn't know anything... he's got
                 nothing to do with this...

                             dino velvet
                 bring the film, or we kill him.

     sorrow and rage rises up in welles, but there's no choice.

                             welles
                 i'll get it.  it's in a safe deposit
                 box, in the city...

                             dino velvet
                 how cooperative.  longdale will keep
                 you company.

     dino takes out handcuff keys, throws them to longdale.
     longdale approaches welles carefully, unlocking him.

                             dino velvet
                 don't let longdale's questionable
                 choice of weapon give you any ideas.
                 if his fey little gun puts enough
                 little holes in you, you'll be just
                 as dead... and so will max.

                             eddie
                 move it, dirtbag... !

     eddie comes to shove welles.  welles stumbles to the
     ground, gets to his feet.  welles walks, takes one last
     glance back towards max.  longdale follows.

                             dino velvet
                       (watching them go)
                 do hurry.
