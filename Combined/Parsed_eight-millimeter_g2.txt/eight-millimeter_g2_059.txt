     int.  missing person archive, file room -- day

     welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled "north
     carolina 1992," flipping through picture cards.  the faces
     of teenagers: a happy boy with blue eyes... a red headed
     girl with freckles... a ruddy faced boy... a pretty girl
     with a ribbon in her hair... a black girl in a pink dress...
     a blonde haired boy with curly hair...

     welles furrows his brow.

     he backtracks to the pretty girl with the ribbon in her hair.

     welles sits straight.  he reaches into his pocket, hands
     shaking a little, takes out and unfolds the photo he printed
     of the girl from the snuff film.  it's her.

     welles compares the two pictures.  she's prettier in the
     card catalog photo, but it's her.

     welles can't believe it, looks around.  secretaries at other
     files don't even know he's there.  welles pulls out his
     notepad, scribbling down information off the card...

     writing the girl's name: "mary anne matthews."
