     int.  welles' room -- night -- montage

     welles is seated, elbows on his knees, reading the diary...

                             mary's voice (v.o., cont)
                 "... i hope i can be an actress.  i
                 hope i can be happy.  i'll probably
                 have to go to acting school.  i wish
                 i knew someone who lived there.
                 i'll miss my friends, but at least
                 i'll be far away where no one can
                 ever find me."

     welles has come to the end of the writing in the diary.  the
     next photocopied page shows an image of the torn ragged edge
     of the diary's missing page.
