     int.  hotel room -- night

     cindy's crying.  amy opens the door with the chain on, sees
     welles, lets him in.  amy and welles embrace, kissing.  amy
     touches welles damaged face, worried...

                             amy
                 what happened to you?

                             welles 
                 i'm okay, honey, i'm okay.  are you
                 alright?

                             amy
                 what's going on, tom?  what happened?

                             welles
                 i can't tell you, amy.  you know i
                 can't.  you have to trust me...

                             amy
                 tom...

                             welles 
                 it has to be this way for now.  it
                 won't be long.

     welles goes to pick up cindy, tries to comfort her, kisses
     her red face as she keeps crying.

                             amy
                 why haven't you called?  why don't
                 you answer your phone?

                             welles
                 i don't know.  i'm sorry...

                             amy
                 you're sorry?  what was i supposed
                 to think?

     amy comes to take cindy from him.

                             amy
                 you owe me an explanation.  you
                 can't treat me like this.

                             welles
                 i wanted to call.  i couldn't.

                             amy
                 you couldn't?

                             welles
                 you don't understand...

                             amy
                 no, i don't, because you're not
                 telling me anything!

                             welles
                 i was in hell.  if i called you...
                 if i heard your voice... it would
                 have been so easy for me to quit.
                 i couldn't do that.

     tears comes to amy's eyes.

                             amy
                 you should have.

                             welles
                 amy, i'm not going to let anything
                 happen to us.

                             amy
                 look where we are.  look at
                 yourself.  you son of a bitch,
                 you don't have any idea what
                 you're putting me through...

                             welles
                 i don't know what to say

                             amy
                 you're killing me...

                             welles
                 don't...

                             amy
                 what was i supposed to think
                 happened to you?!

                             welles
                 amy...

     welles goes to amy, but she pulls away.  she sits on the
     bed.  cindy's still crying.  welles sits beside amy, puts
     her arms around her.

                             welles
                 forgive me.

     amy cradles cindy.  welles rests his head on amy's shoulder,
     places one hand on cindy.

                             welles
                 we have to stay here a few days.
                 i'll get more clothing from the
                 house if i can.  i'm sorry.
                       (pause)
                 we're going to be okay.

     welles rises.  he goes to the phone, starts dialing.  amy
     looks at him, wipes tears.

                             amy
                 who are you calling?

                             welles
                 mrs. christian.

                             amy
                 what?

                             welles
                 she's all i've got.  she's the only
                 witness.

                             amy
                 tom... she's dead.

     welles looks to amy.

                             amy 
                 she died in her sleep three days
                 ago.  it was in the paper...

                             welles
                 i just talked to her.

     cindy's crying.  welles sits into a chair, trying to
     understand this, his mind racing.  he hangs up the phone.

                             amy
                 how could you not know?

     misery pulls down the corners of welles' mouth.  he tries to
     find words, but none come.  he sits forward and hides his
     face in his hands, overwhelmed.  cindy's crying.
