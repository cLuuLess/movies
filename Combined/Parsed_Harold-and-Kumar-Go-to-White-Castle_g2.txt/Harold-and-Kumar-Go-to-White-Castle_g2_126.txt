          141    ext. mid-air - 6:50 am                                       141
                 our triumphant heros are gliding across the morning sky.
                 harold and kumar look down as they soar above the trees...

                                     harold
                        dude, we're so high right now.

                                     kumar
                        we're not low.
                 they continue gliding though the sky for a while...

                                       harold
                        hey, kumar?

                                       kumar
                        yeah?

                                     harold
                        how are we gonna get down?

                                     kumar
                        uh...well...i guess it's just gonna go
                        down at some point.

                                     harold
                        that's a great answer. made me feel
                        really comfortable. thanks a lot.
                 kumar looks down as they fly over a playground.

                                     harold
                        is it a problem if we fly into birds?

                                     kumar
                        why do you ask?

                              harold
                 because we're about to!
          kumar looks up and sees at least a hundred crows flying

          straight towards them.

                               kumar
                 oh shit!
          harold and kumar fly right into the crows.   numerous birds
          collide with their faces...

                               harold
                 ahhhh!   my eyes! don't peck out my eyes!

          the birds cause the hang-glider to go against the wind,

          sending harold and kumar down fast. they are screaming and

          yelling as they plummet...

                              kumar
                 we're gonna die! we're gonna die!

                               harold
                 i hate you!   i hate you so much!

          the hang-glider falls straight into a tree and gets caught in

          the branches. they appear to have been saved.

                               kumar
                 we're gonna live! ha! ha! we're gonna
                 live!
                        (beat)
                 you see, rold? that wasn't so bad.

          snap!!! the branch breaks off, sending harold and kumar

          straight down. they fall about thirty feet, thumping on

          branches as they fall...

          smack!!! they hit the ground and immediately start rolling

          down a hill. they continue rolling...rolling...rolling...

          finally-- they stop rolling when they hit hard pavement.
          harold gets up before he can catch his breath...

                              harold
                        (breathing heavily)
                 that's it...i'm gonna kill you...

          harold grabs kumar by the neck and starts choking him!

                              kumar
                 stop...i...can't...breathe...

                              harold
                 that's the point!

                harold continues strangling kumar, who notices something...

                                      kumar
                       rold...

                                    harold
                       you're gonna die!

                                    kumar
                              (pointing)
                       rold...look!

                harold turns around. he releases kumar from his grip. kumar

                starts catching his breath. harold stands up. soon after,

                kumar stands up. kumar then puts his arm around harold...

                                    kumar
                       we made it, dude.

                from harold and kumar's pov, we see the white castle in front

                of them. they are standing in the parking lot. harold and

                kumar slowly walk over to the entrance.

                they both look at each other-- they're too happy to smile,

                but their eyes say it all. they enter the restaurant...
