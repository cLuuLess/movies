                       way to go, rold! where the hell did that
                       come from?

                       i don't know. eating those delicious
                       burgers made me feel like a new man. now
                       i'm actually looking forward to work this
                       week.

                                    kumar
                       no shit! i guess you're worthwhile after
                       all.

                                    harold
                       i'm not worthless.

                       so those dudes have gonorrhea?

                                     harold
                       beats me.

                       now, come on, let's get going.

                                    kumar
                       what's the rush? there's plenty of time
                       before my interview.

                       i have some unfinished business to take
                       care of.
                they both get into the car (harold gets in the driver's
                side). the car zooms out...
