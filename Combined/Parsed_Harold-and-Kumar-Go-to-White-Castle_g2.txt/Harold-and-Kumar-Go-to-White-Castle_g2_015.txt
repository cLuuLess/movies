          16   int. harold and kumar's apartment - 6:30 pm                  16
               tired and frustrated, harold enters his apartment. the place
               is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a
               poster of "billy madison."

                                     harold
                      kumar?

                                   kumar (o.c.)
                      yeah, i'm in here!
               harold walks over to kumar's room and looks inside. it's
               martha stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the
               floor, etc. on his walls we see old school gangsta rap
               posters. marijuana paraphernalia is everywhere. we see a
               giant photograph of kumar with his arm around mr. t. kumar
               is not in the room, however.

                                     harold
                      kumar?

                                     kumar (o.c.)
                      in here...
               curious, harold walks over to his room (neat, tidy, ikea
               furnishings), where he sees kumar standing butt naked in
               front of a full-length mirror. there's a "clipping sound"
               coming from kumar's direction. harold stares at him, shocked
               and appalled. harold walks inside...

                                   harold
                      kumar, what the hell are you doing!

                                   kumar
                      i'm trimming my pubes.
               kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple
               more snips. on the floor, we see large clumps of hair.

                                   harold
                      why aren't you doing this in your room!

                                   kumar
                      the mirror's in here.
                             (re: his crotch)
                      hey, check it out! it looks like a bonsai
                      tree!

                                   harold
                      i'm gonna puke. get your clothes on.

                                    kumar
                       chill out. it makes my johnson look
                       bigger. besides, if i don't do this, i'll
                       end up with pubes like my dad. you've
                       seen osama bin laden's beard, right?
                harold notices something...

                                    harold
                       are those my scissors? oh my god!     i
                       trim my nose hair with those!

                                    kumar
                       dude, i've been cutting my ass hair with
                       them for the past six months.

                                    harold

                       get the hell out of my room!
                kumar puts the scissors down and exits the room. harold
                shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk...

                kumar puts on some boxers and a t-shirt (i love bush: the
                pussy not the president).

                                    kumar
                              (calling out to harold)
                       so what the hell is your problem, anyway?

                                    harold (o.c.)
                       other than my roommate's boney ass?
