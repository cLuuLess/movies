                 kumar (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is
                 frustrated as he looks at his bills. the bag of weed (wearing
                 a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a mug of

                 coffee. it gives kumar the coffee. kumar takes a sip. it's

                 too cold. he spits it out and slaps the bag of weed...

                 depressed, the bag of weed walks away from the table...
                 kumar hears the bag of weed crying from the other room.   he
                 obviously feels guilty...

                 kumar gets up and runs over to the bag of weed. he picks it

                 up, gives it a kiss, and embraces it with all of his soul...
