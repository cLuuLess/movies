              billy carver (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting
              at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex-
              girlfriend.

                                  man (o.s.)
                     billy boy!
              j.d. banks (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
              the office.

                                  j.d.
                     get your ass ready! it's almost five
                     o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
                     drink on!
              j.d. notices his friend pining over the photo.

                                  j.d.
                     oh god. give me that.     i'm burning it
                     once and for all.
              j.d. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. just as
              the flame is about to touch the photo, billy grabs it back.

                                  billy
                     don't!

                                  j.d.
                     dude, it's been six months.    you have to
                     move on.
              billy nods knowingly.

                                  j.d.
                     you know what'll cheer you up? some hot
                     chick riding your jock all night long.

                                  billy
                     you're such a romantic, j.d.

                                  j.d.
                     it would help get your mind off of sarah.
              billy ponders this for a moment.

                                  billy
                     whatever. even if i wanted to meet other
                     women, i wouldn't even know what to do.
                     i've been out of the game so long.

                                  j.d.
                     billy, you come out with me tonight, and
                     i promise you'll get laid.

                     sounds tempting, but i can't. berenson
                     needs me to update the financial models
                     for his meeting with the foreign
                     investors.

                                  j.d.
                     so what? it's friday!      you have all
                     weekend to do that.

                                  billy
                     no i don't. the germans are taking an
                     earlier flight back, so the meeting's
                     been moved to tomorrow.
              j.d. thinks for a moment.

                                  j.d.
                     well, why don't you just get somebody
                     else to do your work then?

                                  billy
                     who?
              j.d. gets a big smile on his face.    he has an idea.
