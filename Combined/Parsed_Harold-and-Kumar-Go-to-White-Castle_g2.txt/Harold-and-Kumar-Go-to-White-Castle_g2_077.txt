          91   ext. gas station/convenience store                           91
               harold and kumar walk back towards their car...

                                   harold
                      kumar-- you okay?

                                    kumar
                      yeah, i just hate those dicks.
                             (beat)
                      fuck it. at least now we know where we're
                      going. i'm so friggin' hungry...

               suddenly, we hear a car engine start.    harold and kumar stop

               walking and look over at kumar's car.

          they see neil in the driver's seat, turning the key. they

          watch as he puts the car into drive, hits the gas, and takes

          off, driving through a sign, and getting on the road...
          harold and kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without
          saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the
          distance. eventually, harold breaks the silence...

                               harold
                        (calm)
                 did doogie howser just steal my fucking
                 car?

                              kumar
                 i think he did.

                              harold

                 fuck!!!!!!
                        (to kumar)
                 you! you had to pick up a hitchhiker!

                              kumar
                 rold, calm down!

                              harold
                 why the hell did you leave the keys in
                 the car?!

                              kumar
                 i figured that neil patrick harris was a
                 trustworthy guy. how was i supposed to
                 know that he'd fuck us over?

                              harold
                 this is all your fault! this whole
                 fucking night! you know i leased that
                 car! they're gonna make me pay for it!
          harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.

                              kumar
                 where are you going?

                              harold
                 i'm going to call the police!   i don't
                 want to talk to you anymore!
          harold is about to walk in, when he sees cole wind up and
          throw a hostess-like snowball right in the cashier's face.
          "extremes" all around!

                              kumar
                 there's a pay phone across the street, if
                 you don't want to deal with those
                 assholes.

          harold turns around and walks back towards the street. kumar
          walks with him, keeping his distance. they reach the street.
          on the other side, he sees an orange "don't walk" sign lit
          up. harold presses the "walk" button on the post next to him.

                              kumar
                 so after you talk to the cops we're still
                 going to white castle, right?

                              harold
                 i'm not speaking to you.
          harold waits for the "don't walk" sign to change. it
          doesn't. he starts pressing the "walk" button repeatedly.

                              kumar
                 you know, pressing the button a bunch of
                 times doesn't make the sign change any
                 faster. the computer responds to the
                 first press. every press after that is
                 extraneous.

                              harold
                 thank you, mr. wizard.
          harold waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't
          change, he begins pressing the button again.

                              harold
                 jesus christ! when are they gonna
                 fucking develop button technology that'll
                 understand urgency?
          the "don't walk" sign still won't change. kumar looks to the
          left and then to the right. the street is completely empty
          and there is no place for a police car to hide.

                              kumar
                 this is ridiculous.   just walk across.

                              harold
                 it'll change in a second.
          they stand there for another ten seconds.   it doesn't change.

                              kumar
                 come on, there's not a car in sight!

                              harold
                 alright fine. you want me to cross?
                 i'll cross. just leave me alone!
          harold starts walking angrily across the street.

                              kumar
                 finally.

          before kumar has a chance to follow, a police car from out of

          nowhere flashes its lights and stops harold dead in his

          tracks.

                               harold
                 shit!
          harold walks back over to kumar, clearly upset within him, as
          officer palumbo (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the
          car and walks over to them...

                              harold
                        (looking at cop's name-
                         tag)
                 good evening. is there a problem,
                 officer...palumbo?

                              officer palumbo
                 is there a problem? ever hear of
                 jaywalking?

                              harold
                 yes. yes i have. i'm so sorry. i promise
                 i'll never do it again.

                              officer palumbo
                 yeah, like i give a fuck. i'm writing
                 you up a ticket.
          officer palumbo begins writing a ticket.    kumar walks over,
          flabbergasted...

                               kumar
                 a ticket?!   are you serious?
          harold motions kumar to "shut the fuck up!"

                              officer palumbo
                        (to kumar, unthreatened)
                 who the fuck are you, shitwad?

                              harold
                        (stepping in front of
                         kumar)
                 let me apologize for my friend. i promise
                 i will pay the fine. but actually, i'm
                 glad you're here. you know the tv show
                 doogie howser, m.d? you see, doogie
                 howser just stole my car and...

                              officer palumbo
                 pipe down and give me your id.

                              kumar
                        (to officer palumbo)
                 wait. hold on.

                              (more)

                              kumar (cont'd)
                 how can you give him a ticket for
                 jaywalking? i mean, look at this street!
                 he wasn't causing traffic or anything!

                              harold
                 kumar, shut up...

                              officer palumbo
                        (to kumar)
                 yeah, that's not the best tone to use on
                 a cop who could bust your ass.

                              kumar
                 bust my ass?!

                              officer palumbo
                 yeah, koo-mar. bust your ass.
                        (to harold)
                 what's with that name -- koo-mar -- with
                 like three o's and shit. what happened to
                 good old fashioned american names like
                 dave, jim...
          harold points to his id.

                              harold
                 harold.
          harold is starting to pacify palumbo.

                              officer palumbo
                 yes. harold. that's a great name.    you
                 should be proud of that name, son.

                              harold
                 thank you.
          officer palumbo hands harold his ticket and begins to walk
          away.

                              officer palumbo
                 as you were, ladies.
          kumar grabs the ticket from harold and looks at it.

                              kumar
                 220 dollars!? are you crazy?
          palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.

                              harold
                 kumar, i swear to god, if you don't...

                              kumar
                        (to officer palumbo)
                 no, no, no. i understand what's going on.

               harold steps in front of kumar and puts his arms up to block
               him. palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement
               towards him.

                                   officer palumbo
                      hey, hands down! no sudden moves!
               harold puts his hands down and kumar continues his rant, with
               palumbo improvising little responses.

                                   kumar
                      let me guess. you were probably the big
                      asshole in your high school, right?
                      you'd pick on guys like us every day.
                      but then graduation came, and we went to
                      college and you went nowhere, so you
                      thought, "how can i still give them shit?
                      i know! i'll become a cop!" well,
                      congratulations. your dream's come true.
               both officer palumbo and harold are getting really pissed.
               kumar steps in front of harold and offers his friend over to
               palumbo.

                                   kumar
                             (to officer palumbo)
                      hey, while you're at it, why don't you
                      write him up another ticket? or better
                      yet, arrest him. lock him up!
               with that, harold takes a big swing at kumar. kumar sees
               harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. harold's fist ends
               up hitting officer palumbo in the face. smack!!!

                                      harold
                      oh shit.
