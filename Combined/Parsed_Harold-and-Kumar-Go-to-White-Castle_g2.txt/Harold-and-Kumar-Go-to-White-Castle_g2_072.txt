                      okay, let's agree never to talk about
                      what just happened.

                                    harold
                      agreed.

               kumar searches for some clue of where they are.

                                   kumar
                      dude, i have no idea where we are.
               all of a sudden, a hitchhiker waves them down up ahead.

                                   kumar
                      hey, a hitchhiker. should we pick him up?

                                   harold
                      and get chopped to bits?     are you crazy?
               kumar pulls over to the side of the road...

                                   kumar
                      oh, calm down. we're lost. he may know
                      how to get us back on the highway.

                                   harold
                      fuck that! it's my car! we're not
                      picking up a hitchhiker!
               the back door opens and neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car.

                                   neil
                      yo, man, thanks for picking me up.
               harold and kumar look at neil and then look at each other.
               they are in complete shock. harold is no longer angry.

                                   harold
                             (to neil)
                      uh...excuse me, but...are you neil
                      patrick harris?

                                      neil
                      yep.

                                   kumar
                      holy shit, dude! doogie howser, m.d. was
                      my favorite tv show growing up! you were

                                    neil
                             (curt)
