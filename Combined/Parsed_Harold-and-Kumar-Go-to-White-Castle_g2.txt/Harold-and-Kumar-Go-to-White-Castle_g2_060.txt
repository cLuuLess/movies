          74   int. hospital waiting room                                   74
               kumar is sitting in the waiting room. he hides his head in a
               jittery manner, as if he's hiding from someone. next to him
               are daniel and shankar, who are both badly beaten and nursing
               their wounds. they all make eye contact. it's weird.

          harold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck...

                              harold
                 i don't have rabies.
          kumar stands up quickly.

                              kumar
                 great, let's get out of here.
          just as harold and kumar walk down the hallway to the exit...

                               man with thick indian accent (o.s.)
                 kumar!!!
          kumar know that voice all too well...

                               kumar
                 shit.

          
          kumar turns around and sees his father standing next to his
          brother saikat (a nerdy-looking indian guy with glasses, five
          years older than kumar). both are in doctor attire.

                              harold
                 oh, now i see why you didn't want to come
                 to the hospital.
          kumar gives harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.

                              kumar's father
                        (thick accent)
                 i hope you are here to apologize for what
                 you did in your interview today. dr.
                 woodruff is a very good friend of mine,
                 and let's just say he was not at all
                 amused by your antics...and neither am i.

                              saikat
                        (no accent)
                 what the hell's wrong with you, kumar?
                 look at me. i own my own house. i drive a
                 beamer. and i get laid whenever i want.
                 you can have all that too, if you'd just
                 get off your ass and go to med school.

                              kumar
                 eat my balls, saikat.

                              saikat
                 god, you're 22 years old already! when
                 are you gonna grow up and stop with this
                 post-college rebel bullshit? like your
                 life is so tough.
          kumar doesn't have a response.   saikat's right.

                              kumar's father
                 i will not tolerate this business from
                 you any longer. you have one more
                 interview tomorrow and it is the last one
                 i'm setting up for you.

                              (more)

                              kumar's father (cont'd)
                 if i hear from dr. wein that you were
                 anything short of spectacular, i'll
                 completely cut you off!

                              kumar
                 oh, come on, dad!

                              kumar's father
                 "daddy will not be coming on anything!"
                 you will be there and you will behave!
                 i've put too much time and effort into
                 you to let you go and fuck it all up.
          kumar lowers his head.   he's been put in his place.

                              kumar
                 you're right. i'm sorry.
          kumar gives his father a hug.   he even gives saikat a hug.

                              kumar
                 it won't happen again.

                               kumar's father
                 good.   i'll speak with you tomorrow.
          kumar's father gives kumar a quick kiss on the head, then he
          and saikat walk away. harold is stunned...

                              harold
                 wow. so i guess you're going to med
                 school after all, huh?

                              kumar
                 fuck that! like i care what my dad
                 thinks. i can't wait to see the look on
                 his face when he finds out i skipped the
                 interview tomorrow. he wants to cut me
                 off? fine! i don't need his money!

                              harold
                        (extremely confused)
                 but...you just hugged him...

                              kumar
                 i just needed to get my hands on these...
          kumar holds up saikat and his father's scan cards.

                              kumar
                 two words-- medical marijuana.
          harold shakes his head in disgust.

                using the scan cards, harold and kumar walk into a room where
                there are loads of medical supplies, including scrubs. kumar
                grabs a couple and hands one to harold. they put them on...

                                    kumar
                       look, i'm telling you, they see   an indian
                       and asian guy wearing these and   they'll
                       just assume we're doctors. then   we walk
                       right into the pharmacy and get   the weed.
                harold does not appear happy he's doing this.
