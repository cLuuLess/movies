          2   int. harold's cubicle - 4:55 pm                                 2
              harold lee (22 years old, the typical asian-american
              workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up
              his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day.
              billy and j.d. approach...

                                  billy
                     harold, listen, i need you to update
                     these models for me.

                                  harold
                            (confused)
                     but aren't you supposed to...

                                  billy
                     i know, but something came up. i have to
                     meet with some clients tonight, so i
                     won't be able to get to it. it's your
                     responsibility now. okay?
              harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
              protest, j.d. steps forward...

                                  j.d.
                     and make sure it's in tomorrow by nine
                     o'clock sharp.

                     with all the downsizing going on around
                     here, we wouldn't want to have to tell
                     berenson that you've been slacking. he's
                     just dying to figure out who he should
                     fire next.

                                  harold
                     uh...okay...no problem...
              billy drops a big stack of papers on harold's desk.
