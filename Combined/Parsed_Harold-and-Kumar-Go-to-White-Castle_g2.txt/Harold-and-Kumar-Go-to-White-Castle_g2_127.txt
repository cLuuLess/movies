                harold and kumar walk inside. their shirts are torn and
                tattered, their bodies are scratched up, and they're covered
                in dirt. everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them.
                they approach the counter, where a teenager standing...

                                    teenager
                       looks like you guys had some night, huh?
                harold and kumar look at each other, and then back at the
                teenager. their expressions are stone cold...

                                    harold
                       i want thirty slyders. i want five french
                       fries. i want four large cherry cokes.

                                      kumar
                       same.    only make mine diet cokes.

                                    teenager
                       wow. that comes to...forty-two dollars
                       and seventy-five cents.
                harold and kumar take out their wallets.     they open them up.

                the wallets are empty!

                                    harold
                       hey...hey...hey...where's my money?!

                              kumar
                 you don't have money?! shit, i gave all
                 mine to that asshole at princeton! fuck
                 that hippie fuck! this can't be
                 happening! we're so close and we're
                 fucking broke!

                              man's voice (o.s.)
                 let me take care of it.
          harold and kumar turn around and see neil patrick harris
          finishing his coke. he throws it in the trash. harold and
          kumar are stunned.

                              kumar
                 what are you doing here?

                              neil
                 you guys kept talking about white castle
                 last night. it made me start craving it
                 too.

                              harold
                 where's my fucking car you prick!

                              neil
                 yeah. sorry about that. like i said, i
                 was tripping balls last night. i don't
                 know what came over me. your car's out
                 in the parking lot. here are the keys.
          neil tosses harold the car keys.

                              kumar
                 do you realize what we had to go through
                 after you stole the car?

                              neil
                 i know. it was a dick move on my part.
                 that's why i'm paying for your meal.
          harold and kumar look at each other, relieved.

                              harold
                 thanks, i guess.
          neil hands them some cash...

                              neil
                 here's fifty for the meal, and two
                 hundred for the car.

                              harold
                        (concerned)
                 what happened to the car?

                              neil
                 i made some love stains in the back seat.
                 you'll see. anyway, take it easy guys.
                 i'll see you around.

                              harold
                 where are you going?

                              neil
                 wherever god takes me.
          with that, neil walks out of the restaurant.   harold and
          kumar look at each other, confused.

                              teenager
                 hey guys...it's gonna take a little while
                 to make all those burgers. you might as
                 well sit down.
          harold and kumar walk over to a booth and take a seat.

                              kumar
                 dude, we're here. isn't it great?

                              harold
                 i know. i can't believe we made it. and
                 we got the car back! if we can just get
                 out of here in a half hour, i can get
                 back to my office and get the work done.

                               kumar
                 hey, look!
          kumar points to a tv in the corner of the restaurant.    on the
          screen we see a morning news show.

          on the television:

          a female anchor is reporting the news...

                              female anchor
                 today's top story...rutgers professor
                 tarik jackson and attorney nathaniel
                 banks are suing the state of new jersey
                 for racial discrimination and police
                 brutality. we go live to the municipal
                 state courthouse in muckleburg...
          tarik and nathaniel have a bunch of microphones in front of
          them...

                              tarik
                 what happened last night was a complete
                 moral travesty. my family and i are
                 outraged and will not settle for anything
                 less than justice...

          we see tarik joined by his parents (two old gay black men--
          one is comforting the other). nathaniel walks in front of
          the microphone...

                              nathaniel
                        (very professional)
                 and by justice, we mean somewhere in the
                 ballpark of ten million dollars....
