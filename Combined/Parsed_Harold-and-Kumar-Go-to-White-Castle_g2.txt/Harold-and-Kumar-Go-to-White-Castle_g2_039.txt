          47   int. harold's infiniti                                      47
               harold and kumar are looking for the white castle...

                                   harold
                      oh man, i'm so hungry. i'm gonna eat like
                      twenty of those burgers.

                                   kumar
                      i'll see your twenty and raise you five
                      orders of fries.

                                   harold
                      god, where the hell is this place?

                                   kumar
                      don't worry, we'll find it.
               harold sees a high school up ahead...

                                   harold
                      there's the multiplex!

                                   kumar
                      that means the white castle should be
                      just around the corner...

               harold and kumar's mouths drop! instead of white castle,

               they see a burger shack. they're in total shock.

                                   harold
                      what the hell's going on, kumar?! that
                      doesn't look like a white castle to me!

                                   kumar
                      we gotta get to the bottom of this!
