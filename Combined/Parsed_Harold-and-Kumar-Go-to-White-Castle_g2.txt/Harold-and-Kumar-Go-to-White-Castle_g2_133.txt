          152   int. white castle - 7:45 am                               152
                harold and kumar have finished their meals. they both look
                full and satisfied. harold takes one last sip of his soda.

                                    harold
                       oh...that hit the spot.

                                    kumar
                       it was the best meal of my life.

                                    harold
                       mine too.
                the two of them sit there, looking at all the empty
                containers and wrappers. after a long pause of silence,
                kumar speaks...

                                    kumar
                       dude, you know what? i think i may
                       actually go to my interview today.

                                    harold
                       seriously?

                                    kumar
                       yeah. you know, my whole life i've been
                       afraid being just another nerdy indian
                       guy turned doctor. well, tonight got me
                       thinking...

                suddenly, harold notices a convertible parking outside the

                restaurant-- it's billy and j.d. with two women.

                                    kumar
                       there are far worse things in the world
                       than being tagged for having a natural
                       ability in medicine...
                harold pretends to be listening to kumar-- but he is more
                focused on billy and j.d., who get out of the car with their
                women and start walking towards the front door.

                                    kumar
                       like having boils all over your face. or
                       dealing with the shit those black guys
                       had to go through.

                                    harold
                              (not paying attention)
                       uh-huh.

                              kumar
                 besides, i have to admit, it felt pretty
                 cool saving that guy's life last night.
                 somewhere between that, getting yelled at
                 by my dad, and seeing neil patrick
                 harris, i realized that i've always
                 wanted to be a doctor-- i've just been
                 too scared to admit it.
          kumar sees that harold isn't paying attention...

                              kumar
                 hey, rold, are you listening to me?   i'm
                 having a major epiphany here.

                              harold
                 i'll be right back...
          at that moment, billy and j.d. walk in the restaurant with
          their women, zoe and tracy, respectively. tracy looks like
          some bimbo slut that j.d. picked up at a strip club. zoe, on
          the other hand, has a sweet renee zellweger quality about
          her. she and billy are the perfect hollywood couple...

                              j.d.
                 hey, billy-- you paying for this or what?

                              billy
                 i'll be there in a second...
          j.d. and tracy check out the menu. billy takes zoe aside--
          whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you
          complete me" moment...

                              billy
                 look, i have to admit something to you.
                 at the start of last night, all i really
                 cared about was getting some. but then i
                 met you, zoe. you're so different from
                 all the other women i've ever met.
                 you're smart, funny, artistic. i guess
                 what i'm trying to say is...

                              harold (o.s.)
                 what the fuck is going on here?
          billy turns around and sees harold...

                               billy
                 harold?   what are you...?

                              harold
                 never mind me. what are you doing here?
                 i thought you and j.d. were busy all
                 night with "clients." isn't that why i
                 had to do your work?

          j.d. hears the commotion and turns around...

                              j.d.
                 hey! what the hell is going on here?

                              harold
                 back off, cock boy! what i have to say
                 to him goes double for you!
          kumar sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.

                              j.d.
                 cock boy? i'm sorry, but did you just
                 call me "cock boy?"

                              harold
                 yeah, you know i did. you're just
                 stalling because you're not quick enough
                 to think of a comeback.

                               j.d.
                 oh, i'm not quick enough?
                        (to billy)
                 he thinks i'm not quick enough.
                        (to harold)
                 well, i got news for you...
                        (long beat, thinking)
                 i am quick enough...
                        (beat)
                 ...cock boy!
          j.d. is embarrassed. billy tries to placate the situation.

                              billy
                 listen harry...

                              j.d.
                        (to billy)
                 don't even bother with him.   we'll just
                 tell berenson later...

                              harold
                 tell him what? that i'm your work horse!
                 that you guys think you can just party
                 all weekend and leave all your work to
                 the quiet asian guy in your office! huh?
          j.d. is stunned.   now he's a little nervous.

                              j.d.
                 no, no-- you don't understand...

                              harold
                 no, you don't understand. i'm not doing
                 your work anymore.

                              (more)

                                    harold (cont'd)
                       and if either one of you douchebags ever
                       tries to pull this shit again, i'll go to
                       berenson and tell him what's really going
                       on.
                harold notices traci and zoe listening...

                                    harold
                       and i'll tell everyone in the office how
                       you both caught gonorrhea from that
                       whore.
                traci and zoe hear this and are freaked out.   they slowly
                back away from billy and j.d....

                                    harold
                       now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get
                       going. see you on monday.
                harold leaves the restaurant. kumar follows.     billy and j.d.
                are left embarrassed and in shock.
