              billy and j.d. enter the car.

                                  j.d.
                     now get ready. it's time we embark
                     on...operation get some!
              and with that, j.d. presses a button in his car that causes
              the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy
              song kicks in.

              billy and j.d. think they're hot shit as they cruise through
              the parking lot blasting their tunes. when the lyrics kick
              in, j.d. begins lip-syncing passionately. billy loves it.
              when the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
              in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
              j.d. gives a thumbs up to an elderly parking attendant as his
              car zooms out of the parking lot.

          
              quick boom up from j.d.'s convertible and push in to harold
              standing at a window watching as billy and j.d. zoom off.
              he looks at the stack of papers they gave him...
