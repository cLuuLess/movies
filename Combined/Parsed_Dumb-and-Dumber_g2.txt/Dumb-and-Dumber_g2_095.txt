ext. downtown aspen - night

harry and lloyd are hurrying down the sidewalk, clutching
the briefcase. the city is lit up with millions of tiny
lights, like a fantasy winter wonderland.

                       lloyd
          okay, here's the plan: we borrow a
          few bucks just a small loan from
          the briefcase, and we check into a
          cheap motel.

                                                         74.

                         harry
          sounds good.

                      lloyd

          the last penny.

                      lloyd
          that way, whatever we borrow we can
          pay back.

                      harry
          absolutely. we're good for it.

                      lloyd
          you know, as soon as we get jobs.

                      harry
          it'll come right out of our first
          paycheck.
