ext. living room - swanson chalet - night

mary's sitting patiently on the couch with her legs crossed.
she looks at her watch, then flips on the tv.
on the tube - the news is on. a woman reporter is addressing
the camera gravely:

                      reporter
          we'll be back in a minute with the
          story of the blind indiana boy who
          was duped into buying a dead parakeet.

we see billy the blind boy from apartment 4-c sitting in
his wheelchair, holding up petey the parakeet with its head
scotch taped on its body.

                        blind boy
          ...i thought he was real quiet...

                                                       104.

the reporter shakes her head and they go to a commercial.
mary shivers at this and turns off the television. suddenly
the doorbell rings. she gets up and opens the front door.

her pov - a dapper lloyd is standing there in his new aspen-
chic clothes.

                        mary
          yes...?

                        lloyd
          hi.
              (beat)
          don't you remember me?

                        mary
          um... i'm not really...

                      lloyd
          south bend. i drove you to the airport
          last week.

                      mary
              (dawning on her)
          oh my god. lloyd, right?

lloyd is thrilled at this.

                      lloyd
          you remembered.

                      mary
          what are you doing in aspen?

                      lloyd
          i brought you your briefcase you
          left it at the airport so i picked
          it up for you.

mary's mouth drops open.

                      mary
          you're the one who took my briefcase?

                      lloyd
          yeah, it's back at my hotel room.
          come on, let's take a ride. i'll
          give it to you.

mary is torn between getting her briefcase and waiting for
harry.

                      mary
          wait right here.

                                                         105.

she goes to the bathroom door. inside we hear the loud
clanking of metal against metal.

                      mary (cont'd)
          harry, what are you doing in there?
