int. nicholas andre's study - night

andre nervously lights a cigarette as he speaks.

                      andre
          jesus christ...

andre's forehead begins to glisten with perspiration.

                       andre (cont'd)
          all right, i want you back here now.
          if they're coming this way i'm going
          to need you.

                       shay
              (v.o.)
          how's our bankroll doing? giving you
          a hard time?

                      andre
          melvin's not the problem. it's these
          two other guys that have me worried.
          i wish i knew what the hell they

wanted.

andre hangs up the phone and then disappears down his basement
stairs.
