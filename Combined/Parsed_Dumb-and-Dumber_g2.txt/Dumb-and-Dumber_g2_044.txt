int. living room - swanson chalet

an agitated mary swanson (the young woman who lost her
briefcase) is pacing back and forth in

an impressive, antique-filled living room. seated on a couch
are her father karl and his much-

younger second wife, helen.

                      mary
          it just doesn't make any sense. i
          left the money exactly where they
          instructed me to.

                      helen
          actually, it makes a great deal of
          sense, mary. we should have called
          in the authorities the moment we
          knew melvin had been kidnapped.

                      karl
          now, helen, we've been through this
          already for christ's sake, karl,
          these bastards will extort us into
          bankruptcy if we let them.

                      mary
          but i'd never forgive myself if
          something happened to melvin.

                      karl
          stop upsetting my daughter, helen.
          she's been through quite enough
          already.
                      mary
          it's not her fault, daddy. we're all
          a little on edge.

just then the living room door opens and the pony tailed
nicholas andre enters. he looks appropriately solemn.

                      andre
          has there been any word, mr. swanson?

                      karl
          nothing yet, nicholas.

andre looks upset.

                      andre
          perhaps i should call off the
          preservation benefit this weekend.

                                                           39.

it would be easy enough to re-

schedule.

                        helen
            no, nicholas, it's imperative that
            we carry on as usual.

the atmosphere in the room couldn't be more somber. karl
swanson holds his hand out to his aughter.

                        karl
            don't worry, sweetheart. i'll do
            everything they ask. nothing's going
            to happen to melvin, i promise you.

                        mary
            thank you, daddy.

karl swanson looks out the window, concerned.
