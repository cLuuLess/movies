int. mutt cutts van - night

lloyd is now fast asleep in the passenger seat as harry drives
on. a roadsign reading denver - 602 miles whizzes by. todd
rundgren's "too far gone" begins to play while harry peers
at the empty highway introspectively. as the song plays we
see a series of quick shots:

a new sign says denver - 421 miles. lloyd is still asleep
with his feet now on harry's lap.

another sign reads denver - 201 miles. harry stares straight
ahead, practically catatonic. lloyd's feet are out the window
and his head is on harry's lap.

the next roadsign says denver - 157 miles. lloyd's feet are
now up over the headrest and his head is down where his feet
should be. harry looks on the verge of blacking out.

finally, a sign reads colorado state line - 25 miles/food,
gas next exit.
