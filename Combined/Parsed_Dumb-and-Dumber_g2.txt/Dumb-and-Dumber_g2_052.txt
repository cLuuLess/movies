ext. mcdonald's - day

the mutt cutt car is at the drive-through window.

                        mcdonald's employee
          ...that's two cheese burgers, two fries,
          and two medium cokes. five seventy-
          two.

harry hands a ten-dollar-bill to the employee, who returns a
handful of change.

                        harry
          thanks.

                                                           42.

then, before he can  give them   the bag of food, the guys
absentmindedly drive  off. as   they pull out of the parking
lot, the mcdonald's  employee   sticks his head out the window
and waves the bag of  food at   them.

                       mcdonald's employee
           hey!

but the guys are already around the corner.
