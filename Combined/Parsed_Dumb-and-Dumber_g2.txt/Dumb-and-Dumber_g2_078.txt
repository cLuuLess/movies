int. mutt cutts van - night

close up - of harry's burnt shoe     with the toes sticking out
on the accelerator.

                        lloyd
           look, harry, i told you what happened,
           now drop it.
                       harry
           sure thing, lloyd. i promise not to
           mention another word about you being
           in a bathroom stall with a six-foot,
           five-inch trucker with his pants
           own.

                       lloyd
           that's a low blow, man.

                       harry
           not at that height it's not.

                       lloyd
           listen, bud, if you're trying to
           imply that i'm that thought look,
           we're almost in colorado.

                                                         60.

lloyd squints through the windshield. a sign up ahead says:
last exit in nebraska -

colorado state line - 3 miles.

                      harry
          i think it's about   time we pull over
          and change seats.   i've been driving
          for nine straight   hours i  don't
          have the energy to   start a new state.

lloyd nods, and as he pulls off the exit, we

                                                      cut to:

close on a sign - it reads welcome  to colorado, home of the
rocky mountains. pan down to reveal  a number of policemen
stopping and checking cars as they  cross the border. a
helicopter lands on the side of the  road and detective dale
hops out. he hurries to the cop in  charge.

                      dt. dale
          any sign of them yet?

                      cop
          no, but we're expecting them shortly.
          a motorist said he spotted a pooch
          about thirty miles back headed this
          way.

detective dale nods, satisfied.

                                                      cut to:
