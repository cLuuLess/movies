the boys are extremely exhausted as they plow through the
black night toward aspen.

                      harry
          let's get off and crash at a motel
          before i crash into one.
              (yawning)
          i need a crib fast.

                      lloyd
          sorry, har. we're gonna have to hold
          out. seems we misjudged our expense
          allocation. if we pay for a motel we
          won't have enough for gas.

                      harry
          what happened to the dough?

                      lloyd
          we over-leveraged.

                        harry
          on what?
                      lloyd
          i sprung for mr. chili pepper's last
          meal. felt it was the least we could
          o after we deep-sixed him.

                       harry
          wait a second one burger put us
          over budget?

                      lloyd
          the slob ordered a double-bacon eluxe
          and a chocolate malt.

                        harry
          oh.
              (beat)
          so what are we gonna do?

                                                           53.

                      lloyd
