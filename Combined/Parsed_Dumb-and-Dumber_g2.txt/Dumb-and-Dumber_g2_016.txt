int. stanley grabner's office - unemployment office -
afternoon

stanley grabner is small, plump, balding, not a lot of laughs.

                      grabner
          gentlemen, i'm delighted to say that
          neither i nor the unemployment
          epartment of the state of rhose island
          can do anything for you.
              (beat)
          you've run out of chances. you're
          unemployable. remember last year?
          middle of winter i busted my butt to

get you both prime jobs. twelve-

fifty an hour, and you went and blew it!

                      lloyd
          blew it? for your information, we
          only missed three days in two months.

                      harry
          yeah, and that was because of a
          blizzard

                                                         13.

                      grabner
              (exploding)
          you were snow plow operators!

grabner falls back in his chair, exhausted.

                      harry
          come on, stan. i'm sure you can find
          something else for us. how about
          another crack at that suicide hotline?

grabner jumps up.

                      grabner
          out!!!!!
