ext. dante's inferno - evening

a doctor is covering up the body of joe mental as he talks
to detective dale. the etective is a no-nonsense type in his
mid-forties with a military-regulation crewcut.

                                                        51.

                        doctor
          ...my official conclusion is that the
          eceased expired from oxygen eprivation
          caused by the presence of cyanide in
          the bloodstream.

                      dt. dale
          you mean he was poisoned?

                      doctor
          unquestionably. we found these by
          the body.

he holds up the container of cyanide pills. dt. dale nods
and approaches another cop in the b.g.

                      cop
          waitress says he was with a couple
          of younger guys. they're the ones
          who called the ambulance then they
          hit the road.

                      dt. dale
          any idea where they were going?

                      cop
          a witness at the next table thought
          he heard them say they were driving
          to france.

dale frowns at this and the cop shrugs.

                      cop (cont'd)
          we got a report they were seen heading
          west on i-80 toward colorado.
                      dt. dale
          get a make on the vehicle?

the cop consults his note pad.

                      cop
          yes, sir. they were driving an '84
          poodle.

dt. dale does a double-take.

                         dt. dale
          an '84 what?

                                                        52.

                      cop
              (straight-faced)
          well it might have been a wire-haired
          terrier, detective. they're very
          similar in appearance.

the detective looks confused, as we

                                                     cut to:
