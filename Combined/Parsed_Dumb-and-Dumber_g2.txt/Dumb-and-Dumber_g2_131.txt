int. presidential suite

close on lloyd's face - he's starry-eyed in love as he spills
his guts.

                      lloyd
          look, mary, i know this may seem a
          little sudden but i've given it a
          lot of thought: you're the woman
          i've been waiting for my whole life,
          and i'm not ashamed to admit it --
              (holds up his hand)
          --please, let me finish.
              (deep breath)
          i'm crazy about you. i've never felt
          this way about anyone. you make it
          so easy for me to tell you my
          innermost desires.
              (nervous laugh)
          listen to me, i feel like a schoolboy
          again.
              (beat)
          a schoolboy who desperately wants to
          make sweet, sweet love to you.

suddenly we hear   toilet flushing o.s.

reverse angle reveals that lloyd has been talking to an empty
chair. the bathroom oor opens and mary comes out. she looks
around, expecting to see someone else.

                      mary
          oh... i thought i heard you talking
          to someone.

                                                       108.

lloyd is flustered. he swallows hard. it's the moment of
truth.

                      lloyd
          mary...
              (blurting out)
          i desperately want to make love to a
          schoolboy.

                      mary
              (taken aback)
          maybe i should be going now.

                      lloyd
          no, that's not what imeant. i meant...
          i really like you, mary. i like you
          a lot.

she smiles at this.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          i'm gonna ask you something flat out
          and i want you to answer me honestly:
          what do you think the chances are of
          a girl like you and a guy like me
          ending up together?

mary is obviously thrown by this question.

                      mary
          lloyd, that's difficult to say. i

mean we hardly --

                      lloyd
          --i asked you to be honest, mary.
                      mary
          but lloyd, i really can't --

                         lloyd
          --come    on, give it to me straight. i
          rove a    long way to see you, the least
          you can    do is level with me. what
          are my    chances?

                         mary
          not good.

beat

                      lloyd
          you mean not good, like one out of a
          hundred?

                                                        109.

                      mary
          i'd say more like one out of a
          million.

beat

                      lloyd
              (duh)
          so you're telling me there's a chance?

just then, there's a knock at the door. when lloyd opens it,
he's face to face with nicholas andre.

                      mary
          nicholas... what are you doing here?

                      andre
          i've been looking for you, mary.

i've got some interesting news about your husband.

lloyd looks at mary, devastated.

                          lloyd
          husband?

                      andre
          aren't you two going to invite me
          in?

lloyd and mary hear a click and turn to see andre pointing a
gun at them. andre steps into the room, and we

                                                      cut to:
