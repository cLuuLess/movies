int. truck stop caf√â

lloyd and harry are sitting at a booth, surrounded by tables
of tough-looking truckers. harry oesn't look happy. a middle-
aged, no-nonsense waitress approaches their table with a
couple of burgers and drinks. she puts them down in front of
the boys and starts to walk away.

                           lloyd
                   (to waitress)

uh, excuse me...

the waitress reluctantly returns to the table.

                         lloyd (cont'd)
             what's the soup du jour?

                         waitress
             it's the soup-of-the-day.

                         lloyd
             sounds tasty. i'll have a bowl.

                         waitress
                 (sarcastic)
             anything else before i leave the
             area?

                         harry
             actually, this chocolate milk isn't
             mixed very well. could you please
             bring me a spoon?

the waitress sighs and picks up the milk. then she blows
into the straw, mixing
the drink.

                         waitress
             there. now you don't need one.

the guys watch her stomp away.

lloyd

feels good to mingle with these laid-

back country-folk, don't it, harry?

harry wipes off his straw with a napkin. as he moves to put
it in the ashtray, he accidentally

knocks over the salt shaker.

                                                           25.

                      lloyd
          uh-oh...

                      harry
          what's the matter?

                      lloyd
          you spilled the salt. that's bad
          luck. we're driving across the country
          and the last thing we need is bad
          luck. quick, toss a handful of salt
          over your right shoulder.

                      harry
          what for?

                      lloyd
          because that's good luck.

harry shrugs, shakes some salt into his palm, and flings it
over his shoulder. suddenly they hear a

yelp.

                      male voice
              (o.s.)
          what the fuck?!

                      lloyd
          or was it the left shoulder?

they turn and see a burly trucker wiping salt out of his
eyes.

                      trucker
          who's the dead man threw shit in my
          eye?

the huge trucker stands and squints at lloyd and harry. he's
wearing a foam baseball cap that says: wine 'em, dine 'em,
sixty-nine 'em.

                      harry
          it was a terrible accident, sir.
          believe me, i would never do anything
          to offend a man of your size. please
          accept my most sincere apology.

the trucker growls and approaches the table, egged on by his
equally burly friends.

                      burly friend #1
          teach him a lesson, sea bass!

                                                          26.

sea bass glares down at harry's hamburger.

                      sea bass
          you gonna eat that?

                        harry
          um... the thought had crossed my mind.

at this, sea bass leans over and drops a big, brown wad of
tobacco spit onto

the hamburger.

                      sea bass
          still want it?

harry stares at the burger non-commitally.

                      harry
          nah, you go ahead.

sea bass picks up the burger and walks back to his table, to
the laughter of his friends.

                                                     cut to:
