ext. highway - day

the mutt cutts van is going down the highway while danny
wilson's "mary's prayer" plays on the soundtrack. the van
drives past and we hold on a sign that reads: "you are leaving

providence, rhode island. come back soon." various other
aerial

shots of the car travelling down the road while the song
continues to play.
