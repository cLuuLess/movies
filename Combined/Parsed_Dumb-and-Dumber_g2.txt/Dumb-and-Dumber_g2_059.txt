int. dante's inferno

lloyd and harry are sitting at a table with a hateful joe
mental. the boys are each holding up a

pointed red chili pepper.

                      harry
          i'll do one if you will.

                      lloyd
          okay, you go first.

                      harry
          no, you go first.

                      lloyd
          no, you go first.

                      mental
          why don't you both stop being a couple
          of pussies and go at the same time.
          it ain't that hot.

lloyd and harry exchange a look, then simultaneously bite
into the peppers.

                      lloyd
          hmmm, not bad...

                      harry
          yeah, more tingly than hot.

suddenly the boys' eyes light up. they let out a shriek. a
smile begins to curl on mental's lips. he pours them a couple
glasses of water from a pitcher.

                      mental
          have some water. it'll help.

lloyd and harry who are both sweating profusely now start
to gulp down their water. this, of course, makes it burn
more.

                      mental (cont'd)
          aw, shucks, that's right. water just
          makes it worse...

the boys run to the bar and dump pitchers of water on their
heads, much to the elight of a chuckling joe mental.

                                                     cut to:

                                                           47.
