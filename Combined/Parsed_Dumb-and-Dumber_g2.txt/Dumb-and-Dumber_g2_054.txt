int. mutt cutt van - day

                       harry
           about this social scene how do you
           expect a couple mutts like us to
           make a splash in the land of pedigrees
           when we don't even have any money?

                       lloyd
           look, once we drop the briefcase off
           to mary, she'll be so grateful she'll
           plug us right into the party circuit.
           after that, we do a little of the
           ski

scene, hob-nob with the elbow-

rubbers, and walk out of there in the spring with enough
business connections to open a first-class worm operation.
you see, you don't get rich working, harry. you get rich
knowing the rich.
                       harry
           where'd you hear that?

                       lloyd
           some bum down at unemployment.

harry thinks about this.

                       harry
           i don't know, lloyd.

                       lloyd
           what's the matter?

                       harry
           money does terrible things to people.
           i mean, we could lose our friendship.

                                                          43.

lloyd thinks about this.

                        lloyd
          yeah? so?

harry nods and looks out the window. suddenly something dawns
on lloyd.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          hey, wait a second. hold everything.

                        harry
          what?

                      lloyd
          aren't you forgetting something?

harry thinks about this.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          back at mickey d's? a little matter
          you might've overlooked...?

harry wracks his brain, but to no avail.

                        harry
          what?

lloyd rolls his eyes.

                        lloyd
          my change.

as a sheepish harry gives lloyd his change, they notice
something up ahead.
harry & lloyd's pov - on the side of the road, joe mental is
waving them

down again. this time the cadillac is parked sideways across
the road,

blocking their path.

                      harry
          i think this guy's in trouble. why
          on't you pull over.

lloyd looks at harry. harry remembers that he's driving. he
pulls the car to the side of the road. mental approaches the
passenger window.

                                                           44.

                      mental
          you guys going as far as des moines?
          my car died and i'm late for a
          business meeting.

                                                       cut to:
