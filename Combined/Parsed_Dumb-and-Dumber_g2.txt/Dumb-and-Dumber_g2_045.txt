ext. highway - day

the black cadillac pulls over to the side of the road. joe
mental gets out of the car and props the hood open. he takes
out his gun, slides in a new clip, and puts it back in his
pocket.

                        mental
                (to shay)
            lie down on the front seat. after
            they pick me up i want you to follow
            us.
then he folds his arms and the two killers wait for the van
to come along.
