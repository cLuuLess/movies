int. avalanche bar & grill - afternoon

lloyd's now swimming in despair, as the athletic beauty
rambles on beside him.

                                                      98.

                        athletic beauty
          ...anyway, after my boyfriend backed
          into my garage for the third time, i
          said to myself, 'run, cathy, run for
          your life before he kills you both'.
          then you know what the klutz does
          and to be perfectly honest, i on't
          really care.
                (beat)
          look, i'm sorry, but i'm not very
          good company today. i'll say.
                (beat)
          i have an idea. why don't you tell
          me a little about yourself.

                      lloyd
          maybe some other time.

lloyd motions for the bartender.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          excuse me, you wouldn't happen to
          know a mary swanson, would you?

                      bartender
          sure. her family comes in here all
          the time.

                      lloyd
          do you know where she lives?

                      bartender
          yeah, they got that big place up on
          alpine drive.
