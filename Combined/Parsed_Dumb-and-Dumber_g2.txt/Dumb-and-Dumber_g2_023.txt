ext. apartment building - day

at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the building is a
little blind boy, billy. he sits in a wheelchair playing
with a parakeet whose head is scotch-taped on. he throws the
ead bird up, but it flops into his lap.

                        billy
          fly!

joe mental and j.p. shay approach and climb the steps.

                                                     cut to:

close on a note - taped to harry and lloyd's apartment door.
it reads: to all our

loved ones - packed up and drove to aspen - have a nice life -
lloyd and harry.

pullback to reveal joe mental and j.p. shay.

                      mental
          those bastards. they're rubbing it
          right in our faces.

                      j.p. shay
          shit! andre will have a goddamn
          aneurysm if we don't get that
          briefcase back.
                        mental
          don't   worry, we'll get it back. and
          i'll   tell you something else. they
          ain't   gonna reach aspen, either.
          i'll   make sure of that.

mental takes out more antacid pills and starts to chew on
them.
