ext. chair lift - day

harry and mary are at the front of the lift line. the couple
ahead of them get on a chair, and then they shuffle into
position. harry crouches nervously, waiting for the chair.

still in the crouching position, having missed the ride.
mary looks back at him, confused. suddenly he pretends to be
