int. airport terminal - day

mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

she passes a row of phone botths and two men one dressed in
an armani suit, the other in a plaid sportcoat watch her.

                       armani suit
          she's gonna leave the briefcase at
          the foot of the escalator. you make
          the pick-up.

                      plaid sportcoat
          piece of cake.
