ext. airport - day

lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. he closes the trunk
and turns to mary. she looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. she pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

                         mary
          here you go.

                      lloyd
          keep it. it was my pleasure.

for the first time, mary swanson offers a slight smile. this
makes her more lovely than ever.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          relax, mary. just get trashed and
          pass out. you'll be there before you
          know it.

                      mary
          thanks lloyd.
              (beat)
          and good luck with your worms.

                                                            7.

then she picks up her briefcase and walks into the terminal,
followed by a porter pushing her bags. lloyd watches her,
enchanted, until she's out of sight.

afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  lovesick. for a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. he
just drops his head against the steering  wheel, devastated.
there's a tap on the window. lloyd looks  up to see a police
officer standing there.

                      police officer
          come on, move it, you're in a red
          zone.

lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

                                                      cut to:
