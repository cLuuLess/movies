lloyd christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. he gets out and looks up in awe at an impressive
stone mansion. he whistles to himself, then walks to the
front oor and rings the bell.

the double-front doors of the mansion open and mary swanson
appears. she's 25 and gorgeous. lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.

                      mary

                                                          4.

as mary steps back inside, lloyd takes out a tiny can of
binaca. he sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...
