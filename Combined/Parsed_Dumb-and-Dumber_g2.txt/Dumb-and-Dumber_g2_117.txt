int. bedroom - presidential suite - evening

lloyd is sitting forlornly on the bed while harry feigns
surprise at what he's just heard.
                      harry
          it doesn't make any sense, lloyd.
          she told me ten o'clock sharp. are
          you sure you went to the right bar?

                      lloyd
          believe me, it was the right place.
              (sighs)
          i don't know, har, maybe she just
          had second thoughts.

                      harry
          i have a hard time believing that,
          lloyd. the girl said she couldn't
          wait to see you again.

harry paces back and forth when suddenly something occures
to him.

                                                       100.

                      harry (cont'd)
          wait a minute...

                       lloyd
          what?

                      harry
          it just occurred to me. she must've
          meant ten o'clock at night.

                        lloyd
              (brightening)
          do ya think...?

                      harry
          of course! why would she have you
          meet her at a bar at ten in the
          morning?

                      lloyd
              (shrugging)
          i just figured she was a raging
          alcoholic.

harry barks out a laugh at their stupidity.

                      harry
          boy, aren't we a couple of beauties?

                      lloyd
          i knew there was an explanation. and
          here i thought she was standing me
          up.

                       harry
          that'll teach you to jump to
          conclusions.
              (beat)
          anyway, since you have your night
          all

planned, i think i'll run out and catch a flick.

as harry walks into the closet to change, lloyd clenches his
fist and glares after him. then he regains his composure and
moves to the bar.

                      lloyd
          will you join me in a good luck toast
          before you head out?

                                                       101.

                      harry
              (o.s.)
          sure thing, pal. whatever you think
          will help your chances.

lloyd bites his lip at this. he fills two mugs with coffee
and throws a splash of bailey's in each. he check to make
sure harry is still in the closet, then pulls out a box of
ex-lax.

lloyd dumps the entire pack into one mug and mixes it in.

when harry comes out of the closet dressed in a new suit and
tie, lloyd does a double-

take.

                      lloyd
          pretty snazzed out for a movie, aren't
          you?

                        harry
          uh... it's for mature audiences. i
          on't wanna chance getting turned
          away at the door.

                      lloyd
          i see.

lloyd hands him the mug with the ex-lax. then he lifts his
own glass.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          to my friend harry the matchmaker.

harry feels a pang of guilt but drinks up anyway.
                      harry
          mmmmm...

he gulps down the drink.

                                                     cut to:
