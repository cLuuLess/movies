int. bedroom - presidential suite - night

the huge beds are covered in boxes and bags of new goodies.
lloyd is going through it all. harry is sitting out on the
balcony with his feet up on the railing, checking out the
mountain view.

                                                         78.

                       harry
           oh god, it's really true. last night
           i thought i might've been dreaming.

                       lloyd
           it's no dream, har. we finally cracked
           the big time.

                       harry
           and it was so simple. all it took
           was somebody else's money.

harry lights a cigar with a twenty dollar bill, takes a hearty
puff, and

exhales.

                       harry (cont'd)
           you know, lloyd, i think you might've
           gone a little overboard with the
           spending today.

he blows out the twenty and tosses it off the balcony.

                       lloyd
           what's the big deal? we're gonna pay
           it all back anyway, right?

                       harry
           sure, but do you really think you
           needed to buy those two surfboards?

                       lloyd
           surfboards? i thought those were
           beginner's skis.
this suddenly makes sense to harry.

                       harry
           ahhh. i was wondering why you had
           those bindings put on them.

lloyd opens a box and holds up a scanty negligee.

                       lloyd
           where'd this come from?

                        harry
               (sheepishly)
           i bought it.

                       lloyd
           what for?

                                                        79.

                        harry
          i like the feel of it against my
          skin...
                (defensive)
          ...i mean, you know, when a woman's
          wearing it.

lloyd inspects it more closely.

                      lloyd
          harry, how many women do you know
          who wear a size xxl?

                      harry
          look, leave me alone. i'm rich now.
          i'm supposed to have a few
          eccentricities.

there's a knock on the door.

                      lloyd
          enter, parlez vous!

the bell captain, barnard, enters with a champagne bucket
and a newspaper under his arm.

                      barnard
          i brought you your newspaper and
          some champagne, gentlemen.
          unfortunately, we didn't seem to
          have the, um, label you requested.

lloyd examines the champagne's label and frowns.

                      lloyd
          all out of boone's farm, huh?
                      barnard
          you have a rapier wit, sir. i took
          the liberty of bringing a comparable
          substitute: dom perignon.

                      lloyd
          guess it'll have to do, slugger, eh?

lloyd smiles and over tips him.

                      barnard
          thank you so much, sir.

he puts the tray down, hands lloyd the newspaper, and heads
for the door.

                                                         80.

                      lloyd
          oh, one more thing: you can     dispense
          with the 'sir' crap. let's     face it,
          barney, we're all from the     same mold.
              (winks)
          we just have a little more     dough
          than you right now.

barnard smiles and exits. harry comes back in the room. he
picks up a champagne glass and flicks it with his finger,
sending out a resonant ring.

                      harry
          cocktail hour has commenced!

he starts to open the champagne bottle as lloyd begins
thumbing through the newspaper.

                      harry (cont'd)
          hey, later on what do you say we...?

he notices that lloyd's mouth has dropped open at something
he's found in the paper.

                        harry (cont'd)
          lloyd... you okay?

                      lloyd
              (dumbstruck)
          harry, it's her.

                       harry
          who?

                      lloyd
          mary with the briefcase. this is
          her...

he shoves the newspaper at harry.

close on the headline - it reads: swansons to host
preservation gala tonight; city's elite expected. underneath
this is a photograph of mary with her parents.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          mary swanson...

                      harry
          come on, cinderella, it's time to
          get you ready for the ball...

roy orbison's "pretty woman" plays over a...

montage of harry and lloyd's glamour make-over:

                                                          81.

-the boys are in a beauty parlor getting their hair shampooed.

-harry and lloyd sit beneath old-fashioned hair dryers. the
attendants lift the dryers from their heads, revealing both
guys' hair in curlers.

-lloyd's getting shaved by an attendant with a straight-razor.
suddenly lloyd grabs his neck

as if he's been nicked. blood squirts out from between his
fingers. the other customers stare in horror at this. lloyd
laughs and shows everyone a squeeze ketchup bottle hidden in
his hand. only harry and lloyd seem to find this joke amusing.

-we see them getting their nose hairs clipped. pan down to
the floor to reveal a pile of

nose hair clippings.

-then a   shot of a man next to them getting a pedicure. pan
over to   lloyd's bare feet  he has toe nails like howard
hughes.   sparks are flying as an attendant wearing safety
goggles   tries to sand down lloyd's toenails with an electric
sander.

-harry is lying on his stomach with his shirt off, getting a
massage from a beautiful oriental masseuse. he pulls a hundred
dollar bill from under his towel, hands it to her, and
whispers in her ear. she smiles.

-next we see the oriental masseuse lying on her stomach with
her shirt off, while harry happily massages her back.

-the guys are in an expensive haberdashery. harry comes out
of the dressing room in a very elegant black tuxedo. he
couldn't look any more suave. the saleman nods, impressed,
but lloyd shakes his head no and harry goes back in.

-harry reappears in another stylish white tuxedo. the salesman
looks on hopefully, but lloyd again disapproves.

-this time harry comes out in a junior-prom-like sky-blue
tuxedo, complete with tacky frills. the salesman looks
sickened as lloyd give harry the thumbs up.

pan across the street from the haberdashery - an apprehensive
j.p. shay is sitting in a parked car, watching harry and
lloyd.

                                                  dissolve to:

                                                           82.
