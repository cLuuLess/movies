the door opens and lloyd gets in carrying a bag of doritos
and a soda. he settles into the driver's seat and pulls a
beef jerky out of his back pocket.

                      lloyd
          hey, i picked you up a beef jerky...

when he gets no response, he notices that harry is already
fast asleep in the passenger seat. lloyd shakes his head.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          boy, some guys just weren't cut out
          for life on the road.
