int. limo - day

lloyd is driving and mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. she's got a briefcase resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. then:

                      lloyd
          why you going to the airport? flying
          somewhere?

                      mary
              (dead-pan)
          how'd you guess?

                      lloyd
          well, i saw your luggage, then when
          i noticed the airline ticket, i put
          two and two together.
              (beat)
          so where you heading?

                      mary
          aspen.

                      lloyd
          oh, you're gonna love it. i hear
          california's beautiful this time of
          year.
mary looks back out the window and lloyd sneaks another
glance.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          name's christmas. lloyd christmas.

                      mary
          i'm mary.

on lloyd - we can almost see his mind work. he's desperate
to impress her.

                      lloyd
          uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
          it's only temporary.

                                                         5.

                         mary
          oh?

                      lloyd
          yeah, you see, my friend harry and i
          are saving up our money so we can
          open our own pet store.

                         mary
          that's nice.

                       lloyd
              (smiling)
          i got worms.

                      mary
          i beg your pardon?

                      lloyd
          that's what we're gonna call it: i
          got worms. we're gonna specialize in
          selling worm farms you know, like
          ant farms. a lot of people don't
          realize that worms make much better
          pets than ants. they're quiet,
          affectionate, they don't bite, and
          they're super with the kids.

                      mary
          aren't ants quiet, too?

lloyd realizes she has a point.

                        lloyd
          uh... well, sure but they aren't half
          as affectionate. and if you cut an
          ant's head off, it won't grow back.

                         mary
          i see.

                      lloyd
          and best of all, worm farming is a
          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
          industry. i wouldn't mind having a
          piece of that pie, if you know what
          i mean.

to her credit, she doesn't. they continue driving. mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.

                                                            6.

                      lloyd (cont'd)
          what's the matter? little tense about
          the flight?

                      mary
              (beat)
          something like that.

lloyd swivels around and stares over his shoulder at her.

                      lloyd
          it's really nothing to worry about,
          mary. statistically, they say you're
          more likely to get killed on the way
          to the airport. you know, like in a
          head-on crash, or something.

                      mary
          um, lloyd, could please keep your
          eyes on the road.

                      lloyd
          good thinking. there's a lot of bad
          rivers out there.

lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

                                                     cut to:
