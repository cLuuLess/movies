int. apartment - living room

lloyd and harry enter and   pass each other quietly as they
both plunk down in their   favorite easy chairs. (lloyd still
has the briefcase in his   lap.) harry's caged parakeet, petey,
tweets hello, but the two   guys just sit there silently.

the place is a mess. wallpaper's peeling off the walls. the
carpet is threadbare and filthy. in the corner we see a
miniature worm farm and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms. here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes.

                       harry
           i got fired again.

lloyd shakes his head.

                       lloyd
           i don't mean to be harsh, harry, but
           let's face it, you are one pathetic
           loser. no offense.

                       harry
           none taken. were you shitcanned,
           too?

                                                        10.

                      lloyd
          of course not.
              (beat)
          i quit.

                      harry
          why'd you quit?

                      lloyd
          i had a hunch arnie was gonna fire
          me.

                      harry
          why didn't you wait and see if your
          suspicions were well-founded?

                      lloyd
          winners control their own destiny,
          har.

lloyd fetches a couple beers from the fridge and throws one
to him.

                      harry
          you know, the thing that really chaps
          my ass is that i just spent my life
          savings turning my van into a poodle.
              (beat)
          the alarm alone cost me two hundred.

                      lloyd
          big deal. that car's an old bomb
          anyway.

                      harry
          what are you talking about? it's
          only six years old.

                      lloyd
          that's forty-two in dog years.

they open their beers and drink simultaneously. then harry
notices the briefcase.

                      harry
          what's with the briefcase?

                      lloyd
          it's a love memento.

                      harry
          huh?

                                                        11.

                        lloyd
            the most beautiful woman alive. her
            name was mary. i drove her to the
            airport. sparks flew, emotions ran
            high, breasts heaved. she left this
            case in the terminal and flew to
            aspen and out of my life. end of
            story.

                        harry
            what's in it?

                        lloyd
            do you really expect me to go snooping
            around in someone else's private
            property?

                           harry
            why not?

                           lloyd
                (beat)
            it's locked.

they take another sip of their beers. suddenly we hear a
loud knock at the door. petey the parakeet starts to squawk.
the guys look at each other, alarmed, then harry tip-toes to
the

peephole.

harry's pov - a distorted-looking j.p. shay and joe mental
are standing at the door.

                        lloyd (cont'd)
                (whispering to harry)
            friend or foe?

                        harry
                (whispering)
            we don't have any friends.

harry is still squinting out the peephole.

                        harry (cont'd)
            can't recognize them. could be student
            loan thugs again, or the irs, or
            maybe somebody pissed off about that
            case of girl scout cookies you bounced
            a check on.

                                                           12.

                      lloyd
          hey, i ordered mystic mint. the little
          swindlers gave me peanut butter
          praline.

                      harry
          well, whoever they are, they look
          serious. one of them's even wearing
          plaid.

                      lloyd
              (cringing)
          that's a hostile pattern. i say we
          bail and get down to unemployment.

lloyd grabs the briefcase and the two of them exit out the
window and down the fire escape.

                                                        cut to:
