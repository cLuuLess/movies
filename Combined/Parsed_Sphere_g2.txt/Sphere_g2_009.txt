     int.  hallway

     barnes leads norman down the corridor, lined with officers and guards.

                         barnes
               what have you been told so far?

                         norman
               the usual.  plane crash.  survivers
               unknown.  routine stuff really.

                         barnes
               anything else?

                         norman
               nothing else.

     a guard unlocks a large, steel door.

                         guard
               captain barnes.  dr. johnson.

                         norman
               hello.

     norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,
     wondering how the guard knows his name.

                         barnes
               you talk to any reporters?  any
               press?

                         norman
               press?  no, i haven't.

     the steel door shuts loudly behind them.

                         barnes
               good.  security's been our biggest
               worry.  now that you're here we can
               shut this thing down tight.

                         norman
               from what?  what's with all the
               security?

                         barnes
               well, we don't have all the facts
               yet.

     another guard opens up another large steel door...
