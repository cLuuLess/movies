     int.  changing room

     angle on a locker door opening.  inside is an elaborate jumpsuit and
     helmet with the name: "johnson", stenciled above the faceplate.

               are we all -- i mean, is it
               necessary for all of us to go... out
               there?

     the other team members take their suits out of their lockers.

                         barnes
               nothing to be nervous about.  these
               suits are wired and electrically
               heated.  each equipped with an alarm
               that triggers automatically if life-
               support sustems go below optimum.

     norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something
     nuclear.

                         ted
               it's just like swimming, norman...
               you know how to swim, don't you?

                         harry
               you're not afraid of the water, are
               you, norman?

     they all look over at him.

                         beth
                    (half smiling)
               isn't there a psychological term for
               that, dr. johnson?

                         norman
                    (under his breath)
               yeah.  drowning.
