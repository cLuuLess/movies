     int.  b cylinder

     norman climbs inside, takes off his helmet.

     the cylinder -- a maze of pipes and equipment.  heaters, controls, and
     wires everywhere.  difficult to see.

     through pipes

     we see norman -- walking through the cylinder.  holding his helmet at
     his hip.

                         norman
               beth?

                         beth (o.s.)
               leave me alone, norman.

     he goes to her voice in the back.  past pipes, equipment.

                         norman
               i can't do that.

     on beth -- huddled in the back corner, wedged among pipes.  her eyes
     red.  holding the gun in her hand.  pointing at norman as he sees her
     through the pipes.

     abover her head -- a computer screen, reading: "detonation sequence
     09:32"... descending in count.

     norman stares up at the screen, concentrating.

                         beth
               you can't stop it, norman.  you can't
               fight me.

                         norman
               i know.  you're too strong, beth.

                         beth
               oh please, don't shrink me, norman.
               not now.

                         norman
               i --

                         beth
               don't tell me about me.  i already
               know too much.

                         norman
               beth -- gimme the gun.

                         beth
               oh, sure.  here.  anything else, beth
               can get you?  some more chicken,
               perhaps.  let beth check the fridge.

                         norman
               c'mon --

                         beth
               top shelf, is it?

                         norman
               let's get out of here, beth.  let's
               go home.

     she sees her reflection on a piece of broken glass on the floor.  she
     puts her fingers to her matted hair, tries to comb it.

     over the intercom... 

                         man (o.s.)
               nine minutes, and counting.

                         norman
               c'mon, beth.

     on the gun -- we see beth's wrists.  the two scars.

                         beth
               it's over, norman.  go on, get outta
               here.

     norman walks toward her.  beth freaks... 

                         beth
               what is that?  what are you doing?

                         norman
               what?

                         beth
               you hear that?

                         norman
               hear what?

                         beth
               get away from me!

                         norman
               beth --

                         beth
               get away --

     bam!  from behind her -- harry -- whacks beth across the head with a
     wrench, sending her to the ground.

     norman goes to her, checking her pulse.

                         harry
               did i kill her?

                         norman
               i don't think so.

                         harry
               i could hit her a little harder.
               more toward the cranium.

     norman stares at the numbers on the screen above him.

                         harry
               if she's still conscious, you can't
               fight her.  you can't stop the
               numbers.

     over the intercom... 

                         man (o.s.)
               eight minutes and counting.

                         harry
               killing her's the only way --

                         norman
               hey!  look!  we didn't kill you,
               alright?  and believe me harry, i
               would've found great pleasure in
               bashing your head in.

     norman rips off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around
     her head.

                         harry
               fine.

                         norman
               help me lift her.
