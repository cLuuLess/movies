     int.  video feed room

     norman watches on a monitor -- the video of him walking down the hall,
     the navy seaman walking next to him.

                         norman (o.s.)
               ... how we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     on the monitor -- the seaman disappers.

     norman stops tape.  looks over at the monitor showing the sphere.  it is
     closed.

     the screen goes black.  flashes up: "hello norman"

                         norman
               jerry?

     "yes norman"

                         norman
               jerry, did you create that man?

     "the entity navy seaman was a manifestation.  did you have a happy
     talk?"

                         norman
               jerry, are you manifesting what's
               destroying our habitat?

     "did you have a happy talk?"

                         norman
               jerry, answer me.

     "no."

                         norman
               jerry?

     a beat.

     "stop calling me jerry"

     the monitor shuts off.

     norman looks over at another monitor labled "airlock feed".

     on the screen -- beth is putting on her jumpsuit.
