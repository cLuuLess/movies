     int.  underwater -- outside the habitat

     norman and beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the
     habitat.  still hearing the thumping.  they pause, looking around.

                         beth
               coast is clear.

     they go to the south end of the habitat.  the thumping louder.

     norman climbs up the grid-like stanchion, the support beam holding up
     the habitat.  the body above him -- flapping in the current.  thumping
     against the wall.

     he climbs, reaching the body.  a boot swings, catches the loop in his
     air hose.  bubbles shoot out.

                         beth
               norman, your suit -- it's leaking.

     the boot comes off in norman's hand -- and the naked foot, gray flesh,
     purple toenails, kicks his faceplate.  startles him.

                         beth
               norman.  look at this.

     on edmunds' suit -- a long tear in the fabric, revealing red, mangled
     flesh.  droplets of blood float past norman's faceplate.

                         beth
               her flesh has been macerated.
               chewed.  i've never seen a bite like
               this before.

     norman pulls her body out.

     edmunds' faceplate whips around -- and norman sees her staring eyes,
     mouth open in horror.

                         norman
               i can't feel her bones.  she's like a
               sponge.

                         beth
               she was crushed.  feel her skin --
               it's like sandpaper.

                         norman
               what could have done this?

     we hear a sensor: pong.  pong.  pong.
