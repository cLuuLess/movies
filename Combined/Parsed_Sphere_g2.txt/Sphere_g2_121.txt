     ext.  underwater

     close on his face -- terrified.  looking everywhere.  searching.  doesn't
     see anything.  lands on the bottom.

     his life support badge beeping.  shortness of breath.

     he walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  the dark
     water.  can't see anything.  scared to death.

                         norman
               beth?  beth?  shit.

     the habitat -- ahead of him.

     norman goes to a stanchion.  grips onto it.  twists around.  looking.
     searching.  doesn't see anything.  life support badge bleeping faster.
     barely breathing.

                         harry (o.s.)
               ... you there?  norman?

                         norman
               harry?

                         harry (o.s.)
               norman, where are you?

                         norman
               i can't breathe...  am i... clear?

                         harry (o.s.)
               you're clear.  you see the airlock?

     norman, twists around, and as he does... 

     a sea snake

     hisses at his faceplate.  norman screams.

     on his hand -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.

                         harry (o.s.)
               norman!

     norman falls... looking up: the snake wrapped around the stanchion,
     slithering between the grid-like posts.

     the snake's head comes at norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
     backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  the snake, hissing, coming at him.
     it's long tongue flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  norman
     backpeddaling, can't breathe, the snake coming down on him, norman
     falls on his back, the tongue whipping across his faceplate, when... 

     norman is whisked up.

     harry has him by the collar of his suit.  taking him up.
