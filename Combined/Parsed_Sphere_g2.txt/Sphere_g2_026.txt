     int.  spacecraft

     on norman -- cautiously stepping inside.  his helmet light shines on the
     others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide catwalk, suspended
     high in the air.

     metallic beams and rafters criss-cross above them.

     norman looks over the railing -- his light strobes through 40 feet of
     darkness, dimly lighting the lower hull, a dense network of struts and
     girders.

                         ted
               look at this.

                         barnes
               what is it?

     ted spotlights the outer hull.

                         ted
               some sort of lead or something.

                         barnes
               radiation shield, you think?

                         ted
               a foot and a half thick?  that'd
               withstand a helluva lot of
               radiation.

     beth's light shines down onto the catwalk.  we see footprints outlined
     on the dusty floor.

                         beth
               hold on --

                         barnes
               what is it?

                         beth
               any of you get ahead of me -- walk
               this far up?

                         ted
               no.  i don't think so.

                         beth
               well, think.  because there's
               footprints here that aren't mine.

                         ted
               well, they're not mine.

     on the footprints -- large, like the boots they're wearing.

                         barnes
               calm down, alright?  they gotta be
               somebody's here.  let's stay
               together, please.

                                                            cut to:

     long shot -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk,
     walking.  their tiny streams of light moving about.  we see just how
     ominous this spacecraft really is.

                         beth
               it's empty.  why would someone build a
               ship like this?

                         harry
               you'd have to ask them.

     they approach a door, at the end of the catwalk.

                         barnes
               alright, beth, do that thing you did
               before.

                         beth
               how about i just press the button?

     she presses a button near the door.  the door slides open.

                         barnes
               or just... press the button.

     barnes holds out his gun, and enters.  the others behind him.

                         ted
               strange, isn't it?  you know -- how
               it would have a button.

                         norman
               earth doesn't have a patent on
               buttons, ted.

                         ted
               still, make a note i recognized that.

     on barnes -- leading them through a small hall.  it seems to be opening
     up into some sort of room -- when barnes stops.  dead in his tracks.

                         ted
               what's wrong?

                         barnes
                    (serious)
               what do you make of this?

     on norman -- as he steps around barnes, his light brightening on: a
     sign that reads: "trash."

                         ted
                    (softly)
               what the hell?

     very softly, harry begins to laugh.

                         ted
               english?

                         harry
               that's right.

     norman looks up and sees more of the room as his light shines
     throughout it: tables, couches and chairs -- made of leather, very
     comfortable looking.

     they begin to slowly wander about... 

                         beth
               i don't get it.

                         ted
               it doesn't make any sense.

                         harry
               you don't think it does?  i think
               it's rather obvious.

                         ted
               is it some sort of joke?  like one of
               those hoaxes?

                         harry
               a spacecraft half a mile long --
               with 500 tonnes of coral on top of
               it?  someone went to a lot of
               trouble.  try again.

                         ted
               but it's impossible.

                         harry
               is it?

     beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.

                         ted
               why would this ship carry
               instructions in english?

                         harry
               think about it.

                         ted
               unless, this alien spacecraft was --
               you know -- somehow presenting
               itself to americans in a way that
               would make us feel comfortable.

                         norman
               400 years ago?  i'm sure christopher
               columbus would've loved these
               accomodations.

                         beth
               good theory, ted.

                         ted
               well, what's your theory?

                         beth
               i'm a woman.  i don't theorize.  i
               only deal with facts.

                         harry
               all the facts you need are right in
               front of you.

                         ted
               gimme a minute here... i think i've
               got it.

                         harry
               do you?

                         ted
               if it is an alien spacecraft --

                         harry
               save your breath.  it's not an alien
               spacecraft.

                         beth
               then what is it?

                         harry
                    (beat)
               it's an american spacecraft.

                         ted
               an american spacecraft?  half a mile
               long?  and buried 400 years?  yeah,
               good theory, harry.

                         harry
               it's been obvious from the start,
               hasn't it, captain?  that's why all
               the secrecy, why no one was told
               about it?

                         barnes
               we had considered it.

                         ted
               considered what?  that it's american?
               how would you think it's american?

                         harry
               the chip in the door.

     on norman -- glancing up at harry... 

                         harry
               we take a weeny little wedge, bang
               on it a couple of times, and bust
               off a chunk of the metal.  yet any
               spacecraft -- even at a low
               velocity, say 200 miles an hour --
               crashes into the water -- it's gonna
               be like hitting concrete, it would
               crumple like paper.  but there isn't
               a dent to be seen anywhere.  not even
               a scratch.

                         ted
               meaning?

                         harry
               meaning it didn't land in the water.

                         ted
               please.  it must have flown here --

                         harry
               it didn't fly here.  it arrived here.

                         ted
               arrived?  from where?

                         harry
               not where.  when.  400 years ago.  from
               our future.

     a quiet moment as they take this in.
