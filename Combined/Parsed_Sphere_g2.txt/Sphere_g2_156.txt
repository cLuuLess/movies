     int.  airlock

     ... his head bursts above the water level, big breath.  gasping.  he
     flails his arms over to the ladder.  grips the ladder, but his hands
     are like ice.  can't hold it.  he slips.

     flailing in the water.

     he heaves his chest over the metal rim.  twists his legs around, out of
     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.

     shivering.

     tries to get up.  falls over.  his body shaking.  his lips purple.  his
     eyes barely open, looking at... 

     his jumpsuit -- hanging on the wall.

     norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  he reaches
     out for his boots on the floor.  can't grip them.  inches his head
     toward his suit, tries to bite at his suit, but his teeth chattering.

                         beth (o.s.)
               i know what you're doing, norman.
               but you can't save yourself.

     he grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  he rips his suit off the
     hanger.

                         beth (o.s.)
               it's over, norman.  it's all over.

     slipping on his suit, he hears a man's voice... 

                         man (o.s.)
               your attention, please.  your
               attention, please.  all construction
               personnel clear the blast area now.
               tevac explosives are now activated.
               countdown beginning.  mark 15
               minutes, and counting.

     on norman -- as he slips on his helmet, his teeth -- chattering.

                                                            cut to:

     close on the airlock hatch door -- norman trying to open it.

                         beth (o.s.)
                    (through norman's
                    helmet)
               locked.  don't try, norman.  you can't
               get in.  i won't let you in.

     norman turns, dives back in the water.

                                                            cut to:

     underwater

     norman swims out from under the habitat.  looks around at the
     cylinders, the walls.

     goes to the outside of a wall.  looking for a crack, a leak, a way in.

     to his left -- barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.

     norman goes to him.  sees the crack.

     climbing inside.  struggling through the crack, careful not to rip his
     suit.

                                                            cut to:
