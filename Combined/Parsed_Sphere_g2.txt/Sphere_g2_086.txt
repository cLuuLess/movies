     int.  closet area -- dark

     beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls norman inside,
     pressing on him... 

                         beth
               ... he lied to us.  he left us down
               here.

                         norman
               c'mon, beth.  don't make this
               personal.  he told me himself they
               were taking us back.

                         beth
               yeah, he told you.  think.  what was
               barnes doing before they cut that
               cable loose?  he was on the phone.
               except that cable is a thousand feet
               long, norman.  they would've broken
               off communication with us four, five
               minutes before they cleared out.

                         norman
               so what?

                         beth
               so who was barnes talking to at the
               last minute?  nobody.

                         norman
               you're jumping to conclusions, beth.
               don't get worked up --

                         beth
               fuck you, norman!  it's right here... 

     she shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the
     words, reads... 

                         beth
               "although advised of risks, all
               personnel elect to remain down for
               duration of storm to continue
               investigation of alien sphere and
               associated spacecraft.  signed,
               barnes, usn."

                         norman
               where did you get this?

                         beth
               in edmunds' things.

                         norman
               you went through edmunds' things?

                         beth
               he's not just a navy captain -- he
               works for the fucking pentagon.

                         norman
               calm down, beth.  alright?

                         beth
               don't tell me to calm down!

                         norman
               it's done, alright?  it's over!  and
               there's not a damn thing we can do
               about it now, okay?

     he turns to leave... 

                         beth
               you said something to him, didn't
               you?

                         norman
               what?

                         beth
               you told him about me?

     on norman -- pausing, staring at her... 

                         norman
               beth --

                         beth
               you did, didn't you?

                         norman
               don't do this.

                         beth
               you bastard.

                         norman
               beth, i didn't.  hold it together.
               alright?

     she looks at him, piercing into his eyes... 

                         beth
               yeah, okay.  sure, norman.

                         norman
               beth --

                         beth
               no, i should stay calm.  like you
               say.  right, norman?  stay calm.

     norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... 

                         beth
               fletcher and edmunds are dead,
               norman.  and the only one we can
               trust to run this place is a fucking
               liar.

                                                            cut to:
