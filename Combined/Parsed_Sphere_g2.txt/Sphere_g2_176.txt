     int.  decompression chamber

     at the table... 

                         harry
               they're going to want answers and
               they're going to keep asking until
               they get them.

                         beth
               we can refuse to talk.

                         harry
               won't make any difference.  the tapes
               document everything.

     a long beat.

                         norman
               there is one possibility.

                         harry
               we all kill ourselves?
                    (laughing, then)
               bad joke.  sorry, beth.

     she smiles.

                         norman
               the power allows us to manifest our
               fears, right?  what if we feared the
               power to go away?

                         harry
               you mean forget?

                         norman
               it would erase all our knowledge of
               it.  all of our power.

                         beth
               would it work?

                         norman
               yes.  and i think we already know it
               will.

                         beth
               how's that?

                         norman
               down below, harry said we would all
               have to die.  since there was no
               evidence on that spacecraft that
               anybody knew time travel through a
               black hole was possible -- and we
               all knew -- then we would all have
               to die before we could tell anyone.
               death was the only logical
               explanation.  but sitting here, we
               still know.  so how is that possible?
                    (beat)
               unless we make ourselves forget.
