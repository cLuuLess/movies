     int.  cafeteria

     close on a pot -- pouring a white, milkish drink into a cup.

     beth walks it over to norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.

                         beth
               isotonic glucose supplement.

     norman looks at the cup.

                         beth
               go ahead, drink it.

     norman places the cup down.

                         beth
               what's wrong, norman?

                         norman
               i'm feeling better.

                         beth
               are you?

     beth takes a seat.  stares at him.  a long beat.

                         beth
               it's getting cold.

                         norman
               you think i'd really drink that?

                         beth
               you don't think i put something in
               it, do you?

                         norman
               you put explosives around the
               habitat, i can't imagine what you'd
               put in a drink.

                         beth
               i did do that, didn't i?

     a beat.  she picks up the drink, and begins sipping it.  norman watches
     her.

                         norman
               how do you feel about snakes?

                         beth
               snakes?  what do you mean, exactly?

                         norman
               you know what i mean.

                         beth
               am i afraid of them?  not during the
               day.  sea snakes are diurnal.  when
               the sun's out, they don't bite.
               fortunately for you, i had on my
               watch.
                    (off cup)
               this is quite good.

                         norman
               what are they doing down here?  in
               the bathroom?  suddenly appearing.

                         beth
               you tell me.

                         norman
               do you fear them?

                         beth
               don't you?

                         norman
               are you manifesting them?

                         beth
               if i was, then i would've had to
               have gone in the sphere, wouldn't
               i?

                         norman
               did you?

                         beth
               what's the phrase -- "keeping up
               with the joneses"?

                         norman
               why did you go in the sphere, beth?

                         beth
               same reason i put explosives around
               the habitat.  for defense.  for the
               power.  to protect myself.

                         norman
               against what?  harry's unconscious.
               he's not a threat.

                         beth
               no, he isn't.

                         norman
               he can't manifest.

                         beth
               no, he can't.

                         norman
               then why, beth?  why go in?  why put
               out explosives?  why manifest the
               snakes?

                         beth
               you think i manifested the snakes?

                         norman
               someone did.

                         beth
               yes, someone did.  but it wasn't me,
               norman.
                    (beat)
               it was you.  you manifested the
               snakes.

     a long beat between them.

                         norman
               beth you're losing it.  c'mon.

                         beth
               c'mon -- what?

                         norman
               you're lying --

                         beth
               am i lying?  are you sure?  are you
               absolutely sure i'm lying?
                    (off his look)
               then explain to me about the
               jellyfish.  earlier.  why did we see
               jellyfish?  harry doesn't fear
               jellyfish.  you do.  they're your
               fear, aren't they?

                         norman
               but --

                         beth
               and the snakes?  you want to know
               about the snakes?  you saw one
               outside earlier, didn't you?  when
               you thought i had deserted you --
               you were terrified.

                         norman
                    (realizing)
               that's when you went in the sphere.

                         beth
               one lonely, terrifying sea snake.

                         norman
               you manifested that, beth.

                         beth
               did i?  or was that you?
                    (beat)
               when you were hiding in the bathroom
               -- all conspiratorially like you were
               -- you became frightened, didn't
               you?  terrified.  like you were with
               the snake earlier -- and suddenly
               you have snakes slithering all over
               the floor.  you did that, norman.

                         norman
               you're insane.

                         beth
               am i?  or am i making so much sense
               that you're going insane?

                         norman
               i never went in that sphere.

                         beth
               you don't remember you did.  but i'm
               sure you remember running like some
               fucking hero to get harry, don't
               you?  you remember that.

                         norman
               yes.

                         beth
               you remember before you picked him
               up -- when you looked up at the
               sphere, you remember that -- when
               the sphere opened?
                    (off his look)
               that's right.  but you can't remember
               going inside, can you?  no, of course
               not.  harry couldn't either, could
               he?  "like everything's on the tip of
               my tongue", he said.

                         norman
               that's bullshit.

                         beth
               is it?

                         norman
               beth, the message said harry.  "my
               name is harry".  my name isn't harry.

                         beth
               no, it isn't.  your name is norman.
               but your younger brother -- what was
               his name?  the one who was stung when
               you were younger.  the one that died.
               the one you couldn't save.  what was
               his name?
                    (imitating)
               "mommy, we're going out to the ocean
               -- to go swimming." "but i don't
               want to go swimming, norman.  i'm
               scared." "c'mon, harry, it'll be
               fine, it'll be fun."
                    (resuming)
               you heartless fuck.  that's why
               you're so scared of the water, isn't
               it?

                         norman
               shut up, beth --

                         beth
               when you were in that sub -- and
               that squid was attacking you -- are
               you sure it was the squid that was
               attacking?  do you know?  "i can't get
               beth on the radio.  i'm in this tiny
               sub on the bottom of the fucking
               ocean.  all alone.  surrounded by all
               this water." was it really the squid
               that was attacking you, norman -- or
               was it something else -- one of your
               fears?  you never really saw what it
               was, did you?

     norman stares up at her, frightened.  is she right?

                         beth
               i'm not scaring you, am i norman?  i
               hope i'm not frightening you.  the
               last thing i want to do is frighten
               you.  you feel okay, don't you?

                         norman
               it's not me, beth.  i swear.  it can't
               be.

                         beth
               "it's not me, beth.  it's not me.  it
               can't be.  i'm not doing anything."
               just like harry said before i
               stabbed him with the needle.

     norman looks at her palm -- sees the needle in her hand.  norman backs
     up, away.

                         norman
               don't, beth.

                         beth
               but i have to, norman.

                         norman
               i promise --

                         beth
               promise what, norman?  tell me!

                         norman
               beth --

                         beth
               you think i'd belive you?  believe
               anything you might say now?  after
               you lied to me about telling barnes
               about my past.  about my problems.  my
               problems.  not yours.  not his.  mine.

                         norman
               don't, beth.  please.

                         beth
               it's either this... or i kill you.

     the gun in her other hand.

                         norman
               beth --

     she comes at him, needle in hand... 

                         beth
               it's your choice.  because it's not
               safe for you to be awake.  to be
               walking around.  to be thinking about
               things.

                         norman
               it's not safe for you to be either.

                         beth
               you think i care?  you think i care
               if i die?
                    (almost laughing)
               would i put explosives around the
               habitat -- set on vibration sensors
               -- that can trigger automatically,
               if i cared about myself?  would i?
               i've tried twice before, norman, why
               wouldn't i try a third time?  i'm not
               thinking about myself -- no, norman,
               i'm thinking about you.  your safety.
               protecting you from your own self.

     she lunges at him with the needle, missing.  he runs for the spiral
     staircase leading to the lab.  norman grabs the handrail, begins
     climbing the stairs.

     beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.

                         beth
               norman!  i'm doing this for you,
               norman.

     he frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.

                         beth
               norman.

     climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the stairs never seem to end.
     he looks up:

     the stairs -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in
     number.  he climbs, racing, panting.  beth, right behind him, laughing
     almost.

                         beth
               come here, norman.

     she grabs his ankle.  she raises the needle.  norman turns, kicks her in
     the face.

     she wails, blood spitting from her nose.

     climbing, climbing.  the stairs increasing above.  he lunges for the top
     step, grabs it.  pulls himself up... 

     into the lab

     scrambling.  he stares down at beth -- the gun pointing at him.

                         beth
               norman --

     he slams the hatch door, on top of her, bashing her head down.  he
     holds the door closed.  trying to regain his breath.

                         beth (o.s.)
               this is what i'm talking about,
               norman.  don't you see?  it's in you.
               this vindictiveness.  this rage.

                         norman
               get away from the door, beth.

     he slides a heavy file cabinet over on top of the door.

                         beth (o.s.)
               oh, norman, i don't want to come
               in... 

     the door's metal pivot turns... 

                                                            cut to:

     on beth -- on the stairs, spinning the door's wheel... 

                         beth
               ... i want to lock you in.

                                                            cut to:
