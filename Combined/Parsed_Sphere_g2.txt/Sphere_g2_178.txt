               when you were being transferred to
               decompression, dr. adams, you
               mentioned something about a squid.

                         admiral
               a squid.  however, there doesn't seem
               to be any squid recorded on these
               tapes.

                         beth
               a squid?  i don't remember anything
               about a squid.
                    (to harry)
               did you say something about a squid,
               harry?

     harry shakes his head.
