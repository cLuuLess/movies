     edmunds, norman, beth, ted staring at the monitor... 

                         ted
               i thought he was with you, norman.

     through the speakers... 

                         barnes (o.s.)
               get him out of there.  i thought i
               told you people --

                         edmunds
                    (into her mic)
               harry?  can you copy?

     on the monitor -- harry, before the sphere... 

                         harry
               pay close attention.  i think you
               will find this of interest.

     the sphere door slowly opens.

                         ted
               what the hell is he doing?

     harry steps up and into the sphere.  the door closes slowly behind him.
