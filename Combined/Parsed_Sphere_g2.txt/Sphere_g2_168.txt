     ext.  underwater

     underneath the sub's dome hanger

     norman tries to climb up the ladder with beth on his back.  she falls
     off, deadweight to the ground.

                         norman
               shit.
                    (picking her up)
               harry!  i'm gonna have to lift her up
               to you.

     harry leans down from the sub's airlock... 

                         harry
               alright.  hurry.

     norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.

                         harry
               i can't reach her.

                         norman
               hold on.

     norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.

                         harry
               push her, c'mon.

                         norman
               i'm trying.  shit.  here -- catch her.

     he flops her up again.

                         harry
               missed.

                         norman
               are you trying, damn it?  just --

                         man (o.s.)
               four minutes and counting.

     norman loses grip, drops her.

                         norman
               hold on.

                         harry
               hurry, norman.  four minutes.

                         norman
               i heard!  i heard!

     picking her up... 

                         harry
               three fifty-six, three fifty-five,
               three --

                         norman
               shut up and catch.

     norman flops her up once more, and harry grabs her air hose.

                         harry
               i got her.  i got her.

     harry pulls her toward the airlock, norman climbs up after.
