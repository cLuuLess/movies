     ext.  ship deck -- day

     the helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  a
     young, female officer -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to
     greet norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.

     she looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.

                         officer
               any other bags, dr. johnson?

                         norman
               just that.  careful, it's heavy.

     she lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.

                         officer
               no other equipment?  scientific
               instruments?

                         norman
               no, they didn't say --

                         officer
               this way, sir.

     norman follows the officer away from the helipad.
