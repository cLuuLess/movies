     int.  living quarters

     on norman -- gathering his things.  stuffing his shotty dufflebag.

     beth, at her bunk, doing the same.

     norman stands up.  looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes,
     unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: property of dr.
     harry adams.

     on norman -- panicking, looking around for harry.

                                                            cut to:

     back in -- communications room

                         barnes
                    (into phone)
               ... i said send the subs down, damn
               it!

     barnes out the door, ted at his heels... 

                         ted
               did you hear me, sir, because --

                         barnes
               ted, shut up.  are you packed?  ready
               to go?  i want everyone packed.  now!

     on norman -- running at them... 

                         norman
               harry's missing.

                         barnes
               what do you mean, he's missing?

                         norman
               he's missing.  he's gone.  he left.

                         barnes
               he's here somewhere.  find him.  the
               sub's on it's way.
                    (they look at him)
               go!  c'mon!

     norman runs off.  barnes storms down the hall... 

                         barnes
               how can he be missing?

                         ted
               sir, about leaving --

                         barnes
               we're on the bottom of the fucking
               ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
