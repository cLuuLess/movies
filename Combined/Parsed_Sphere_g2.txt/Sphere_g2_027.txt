     int.  spacecraft -- deeper inside

     ted and barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth
     flashlights.

                         ted
               time travel.  i always thought it was
               one of those myths... like santa's
               reindeer.

                         barnes
               what would we be working on in the
               future that would make us want to
               come back?

                         ted
               maybe we didn't want to come back.

     back in -- the room

     norman, harry, and beth... 

                         beth
               what are you looking for?

                         harry
               a light switch.  a button opened that
               door -- the craft runs on some sort
               of power.

     on norman -- as he sits down in one of the chairs.

                         beth
               what's that noise?

     they listen to a girgling noise.

                         norman
               sounds a little like water --

     suddenly -- the chair norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him
     inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him
     -- sucking him inside... 

                         beth
               norman!

                         norman
               get this thing off me.

     beth bends down, presses a button, the chair releases norman... 

                         beth
               i think the chair thinks you want to
               fly this thing.

     on beth's faceplate -- as she's looking down -- we begin to see --
     reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering
     across... 

     "rv-lhooq... dcom1... "

     her eyes look up slowly... as we

                                                            cut to:

     the black screen in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow
     lettering:

     "rv -- lhooq -- dcoml -- u.s.s star voyager"

     "assimilating database" as a series of numbers race upwards in
     count... 

     and the desk in front of them lights up, a control panel coming to
     life.  

                         harry
               nice work, norman.

                         norman
               whatever i can do to help.

     on the screen as it changes, now filled with columns:

     ship systems
     data systems
     quarter master
     flight records

     harry punches some keys on the control panel.

                         harry
               a flight recorder.  our future is
               about to be seen in our present.

     on the screen as it changes:

     flight data summaries
     fds 01/01/47-12/31/49
     fds 01/01/50-12/31/52
     fds 01/01/53-12/31/55
     fds 01/01/56-12/31/56
     fds 01/01/56-02/01/56
     fds 02/02/56-unknown entry event

                         norman
               01-01-47.  two thousand-forty seven.
               50 years in our future.

                         harry
               unknown entry event.

     harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 

     on the screen -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... 
     we see a galaxy of stars, planets coming off the screen, into the
     room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the
     illusion of depth.

     the image begins streaking outward, toward us, moving rapidly, like
     we're flying through it.

     the stars and other space matter streaking by.

                         beth
               what's that cluster of stars there?
               in the center?

     harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-d image... 

                         harry
               our answer.

                         norman
               to what?

                         harry
               time travel.  a black hole.

     the cluster of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer
     and closer, brightening.

     the field twists and turns as the screen and field become blinding as
     we enter the cluster, the black hole.

     on norman -- his face, bright, frightened as he hears:

                         harry (o.s.)
               ted?  captain?

                         barnes (o.s.)
               yes, harry.

                         harry (o.s.)
               we know how this craft got here.
               where it's been.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               so do we.  and it seems to have
               picked up something on it's travels.

     still on norman -- frightened... 

                         norman
               picked up something?  what is it?

                         barnes (o.s.)
               i don't know.  but it's something
               alien.
