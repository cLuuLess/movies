     int.  spacecraft airlock

     close on norman's face as he watches the water recede, down past his
     faceplate.

     the loud banging of metal

     ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and bangs at it with a
     sledgehammer.

                         harry
               easy ted, we're not mining gold.

                         ted
               gimme some room here, will you?  back
               off.  gimme some space.

     they all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as ted
     keeps swinging.

                         beth
               looks alot like an airplane door,
               doesn't it?

     ted stops and looks at the door.

                         ted
               alot like.  you know, i noticed it
               before, but i didn't...

                         harry
               shutup, ted.  you didn't notice shit.
               keep hammering.

                         norman
               you want me to try?

                         ted
               you're a 53 year old shrink, what
               are you gonna do?

                         barnes
               give him the hammer, ted.

     norman takes the hammer.  walks up to the wedge.  gets his bearings.
     rears back... then stops.

                         ted
               what is it, your back give out?

     something has caught norman's eye.  he looks down at the wedge.

                         barnes
               what is it, norman?

                         norman
               take a look.

     barnes comes toward him.  the others follow.  barnes bends down, looks
     closely down at the wedge in the door.

                         barnes
               it's chipped.

                         harry
               chipped?  the door?  how can it be
               chipped?

                         barnes
               i don't know how it can be chipped,
               but it's chipped.

                         harry
               i thought you said there wasn't any
               damage done in the crash?

                         barnes
               i did.

                         harry
               then how can it be chipped?

     on beth -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around.

                         beth
               there's heat coming the door.

                         barnes
               back away then.

                         beth
               wait a minute --

                         barnes
               i said back away.

                         beth
               would you wait a minute?

     the door starts to rumble

     barnes unstraps a gun -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his
     buckle.

                         barnes
               ted, get her away from the door.

                         ted
               what are you going to do -- shoot
               her?

     the rumbling louder...

                         barnes
               get her away!

     the door begins to slide open.

     beth backs away.

     the door, sliding, is revealing complete blackness inside.  the door
     stops, it's open, it's quiet.  they all stand there, looking at
     blackness.  a long beat.
