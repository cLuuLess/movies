     int.  corridor

     thump!  norman and beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their
     feet, running... 

     on ted -- sliding out of the control room, down the corridor, taken by
     the water.

     beth grabs him, as norman stumbles

     into the control room

     finds the pressure gage, shuts it off.
