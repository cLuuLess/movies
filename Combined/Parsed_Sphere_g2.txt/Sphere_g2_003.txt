     int.  helicopter -- day

     norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  he studies a
     pamphlet in his hand: "aircrash survival: how to cope".  the pilot, in
     the cockpit, turns to him.

                         pilot
               what kinda work you in, dr. johnson?

     norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.

                         norman
               i'm in psychology.  was.  still am
               really, just been a while.
                    (beat)
               i treat aircrash survivors.

                         pilot
               oh, so you're that dr. johnson.

                         norman
               you've heard of me?

                         pilot
               well, everybody's been talking about
               that report you wrote.

                         norman
               what report?

                         pilot
               huh?

                         norman
               what report?

                         pilot
               you mean you don't know?

                         norman
               know what?

     the pilot glances back at him again.

                         pilot
               must be another johnson then.  been
               flying so many scientists out here
               -- can't keep everyone straight.

                         norman
               who's everyone?

                         pilot
               physicists, mathematicians,
               geologists, you name it.

                         norman
               geologists?  at a plane crash?

                         pilot
               strange, isn't it?  in the middle of
               the ocean no less.

                         norman
               what the hell would a geologist be
               doing at a plane crash?

     norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the
     water.
