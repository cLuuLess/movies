     int.  video feed room

     edmunds, barnes, and the team members (minus ted) look at the monitor.

                         barnes
               so how do we get it open?

                         harry
               ted seems to have some ideas.

     on the monitor -- ted pushing on the sphere door.  banging into it with
     his shoulder.

                         norman
               maybe we shouldn't.

                         barnes
               what?

                         norman
               if it is alien, maybe we shouldn't
               try to open it at all.

                         harry
                    (nodding to norman)
               man is man, all he knows is man, and
               all he can think of is what he
               knows.  the anthropomorphic problem.
               good, norman.

                         barnes
               the what?

                         norman
               i mentioned it in my report.  didn't
               you read the report?

                         harry
               everything ever written about extra-
               terrestial life imagines that life
               is essentially human.  if it doesn't
               look human, it's a reptile or a big
               insect or something, having human
               values, human understanding.

                         barnes
               so?  what's the problem?

                         harry
               it's nonsense.  there's enough
               difference between our own species
               to prove that.

                         beth
               take politics, our views on
               abortion, the death penalty... 

                         harry
               cannibalism, to be extreme.  and now
               we're talking about a new life form.
               their values and ethics may be
               incomprehensible.

                         barnes
               like "thou shall not kill"?

                         norman
               or maybe, it can't be killed.

                         barnes
               you mean, what's in that thing is
               immortal?

                         norman
               i don't know.  that's the point.

                         barnes
               everything can be killed.

                         beth
               not everything.  even on earth.  take
               ... yeasts.

                         barnes
               yeasts?  thank you, beth, but i don't
               think we're gonna open it up and
               find a loaf of bread.

                         harry
               and we're just talking about three-
               dimensional creatures.  what if it's
               five or six or seven-dimensional?  so
               dimensional that we couldn't even
               see it to kill it.

                         norman
               good point.  i don't know what you're
               talking about, but good point.

                         barnes
               or it could contain some great
               benefit to us, some astonishing new
               idea or technology to help mankind.

                         harry
               it could.  but the odds of it being
               any use to us are against it.

                         barnes
               you don't know that.

                         harry
               let's say whoever made this thing is
               a thousand years ahead of us, just
               like we are to, say, medieval
               europe.  suppose you went back to
               medieval europe with a tv set.  there
               wouldn't be any place to plug it in.

                         barnes
               just tell me worst case.  worst case
               of what we might find?

                         beth
               it could breathe in air and exhale
               cyanide gas.

                         norman
               disrupt our brain waves, interfere
               with our ability to think.

                         harry
               produce radioactive waste and
               disintegrate us into nothing.
