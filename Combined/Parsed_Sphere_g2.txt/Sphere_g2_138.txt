     norman and beth sit at a table, sipping coffee.

                         norman
               i'm sorry.

                         beth
               for what?

                         norman
               not believing you.

                         beth
               you're not sorry.  you're scared.
                    (beat)
               you're a psychologist, norman.  you
               pride yourself on knowing when
               someone's lying to you, not telling
               you the truth.  and now you're scared
               ... because you're not sure you can
               tell anymore.
