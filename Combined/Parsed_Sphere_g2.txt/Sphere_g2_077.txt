     int.  bathroom/shower area

     ted, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has
     norman's ear in front of the sink... 

                         ted
               he's manic, norman.  you know that?
               this reliance on harry is misplaced.
               you hear me?  totally misplaced.  he's
               overlooking things.  obvious things.

                         norman
               like what?

     ted hands him a printout... 

                         ted
               it's not some fucking substitution
               code, it's a direct visual
               representation.

                         norman
               you mean a picture?

                         ted
               take a look.  i rearranged the
               numbers.  put 'em up to the light.
                    (norman does)
               go ahead.  squint at it.

                         norman
               i don't see anything.

                         ted
               squint harder.

                         norman
               please, ted.

                         ted
                    (hands him another
                    printout)
               try this one.

                         norman
               this is like nursery school.

                         ted
               don't you see it?  it's a picture of
               the creature.

                         norman
               the creature?

                         ted
               inside the sphere.  look, that's the
               vertical torso, three legs, two
               arms.  there's no head, so i'm
               guessing the creature's head is
               located within the torso itself, you
               know?

     on norman -- ted's lost it.

                         norman
               well, how about we wait and see what
               harry comes up with?

                         ted
               sure, why not.  give him the trophy.
               that pretentious son of a bitch.  you
               heard him, norman.  all that "someone
               went to a lot of trouble, try again"
               bullshit.  and "impotent".  where does
               he get off saying i'm impotent?  he's
               a fucking self-righteous, little
               prick.

                                                            cut to:

     close on monitor -- spirals now.

                         harry
               ... i asked myself, why would the
               sphere be using a code?  if you're
               trying to communicate, why use a
               code?

                         ted
                    (to norman)
               see?  no code.  what'd i say?

                         harry
               codes are for hiding information.  so
               it's making a mistake.  it's making a
               code without intending to.  i figured
               it's probably substituting numbers
               for letters...  then i began to wonder
               what an alien intelligence would
               make of our keyboard.  and since
               we're getting spirals, i imagined
               the keyboard as a spiral.  so i
               translated it... 

                         norman
               that's brilliant.

     ted grimaces at norman.

                         harry
               ... spiralling out of the center, you
               see: "g" is one, "b" is two, "h" is
               three, and so on... when i got the
               message.

                         barnes
               what's the message?

                         harry
               i have to tell you.  it's strange.

                         barnes
               how do you mean, strange?

     harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads:

                         harry
               "hello.  how are you?  i am fine.  what
               is your name?  my name is jerry."

                                                            cut to:
