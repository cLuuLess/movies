     int.  video feed room

     close on a monitor -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray
     metal of the spacecraft.

                         barnes
               edmunds, bring up the robot's camera
               feed.

     jane edmunds, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  another
     monitor clicks on -- showing the robot's pov of the door.

                         ted
               captain, you know, i really
               appreciate you hauling us a thousand
               feet below sea level so we can watch
               this historical event on television.

                         barnes
               nobody goes inside, until we know
               what's inside.

     on the monitor -- the robot camera scans the spacecraft hull, stops on
     a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.

                         barnes
               can you open that panel?

                         edmunds
               working on it now, sir.

     on the monitor -- a robotic claw extends out to the panel.  trying to
     pry the panel open.

                         ted
               i'd like it noted in the report that
               i think we should be doing this
               ourselves.  making a manned entry...

     the claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.

                         ted
               i'd also like it noted --

                         barnes
               duly noted, ted.  edmunds, try using
               suction.

     on the monitor -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber
     sucker.  it pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.

                         edmunds
               it's not sucking, sir.

                         barnes
               thank you, i can see that.  try
               something else.

                         edmunds
               we don't have anything else to try,
               sir.

                         barnes
               well, shit -- find something, do
               something... make something up --

                         ted
               what about a crowbar?

     barnes straightens up, looks at ted...

                         barnes
               what about a crowbar?

                         ted
               what if we go out there, you know --
               wedge a crowbar in the door and pry
               the thing open.

                         harry
               pry the thing open?  what are we --
               neanderthals?

                         beth
               all that banging and pounding.  i
               don't know.  we should think about
               making a good first impression.

                         harry
               for who?  the fish?

                         beth
               for whoever's in that thing.

                         barnes
               or whatever's in that thing.

     on the monitor -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back
     at them.

                         barnes
               norman, what do you think?

     norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...

                         norman
               me?  well -- i don't really...  i
               mean, you could... you know, you
               could make a real solid case... a
               crowbar?

     all eyes on norman.

                         norman
               i don't know.

     a beat as they all stare at him.

                         ted
               i'm secure enough with that.
