     int.  communications room

     fire blasts out from the wall... 

     beth and norman (still with ted) wearing gas masks, rush into the
     room... 

                         beth
               stay low!

     beth sprays white foam on the fierce flames, licking up the side
     padding, smoke boils to the cieling.

     bang!  the room is rocked.

                         norman
               it won't stop.

     norman falls to the floor, losing ted.

     ted -- slides away and under the computer console.

     bang!  the computer console breaks -- computers, monitors, fall,
     crushing on ted's legs.  he screams out in agony.

     norman scrambles towards him through the smoke when... 

     the console catches fire, erupts in flame.  ted underneath it.

     beth -- her extinguisher out of foam.

     norman -- runs to a wall, finds an extinguisher casing, it's been bent,
     can't get it open.

     ted -- reaches out in desperation as his legs catch fire.

                         ted
               norman!

     norman -- bashes the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the
     extinguisher, turns... 

     ted -- his entire body on fire.

     bang!  norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the
     floor.  he reaches out -- can't get it.

     close on ted -- his face burning... 

                         ted
               norman!  nor--

     bang!  the lights go out.

     darkness

     norman -- watches in horror as he watches ted, lit in flame, burning to
     death.

     norman -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs metal, and he's
     electricuted.  falls backward, head first, and everything goes... 

     black

     a long beat.
