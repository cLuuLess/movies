     int.  testing room -- later

     a large, x-ray apparatus moves to the side, revealing norman's face.

     on beth -- standing next to him.

                         beth
               five years.  no phone calls.  what am
               i -- a leper?

     norman sits up...

                         norman
               beth, look, can i trust you with a
               little secret?

                         beth
               i love secrets.

                         norman
               that ulf report everybody's patting
               me on the back about?

                         beth
               i've read it twice, norman.  it's
               brilliant.

                         norman
               it's bullshit.  the report's a joke.

                         beth
                    (beat)
               that's quite a secret.

                         norman
               i spent a week reading sagan and
               watching re-runs of the twilight
               zone.  seriously.  i was just trying
               to pay the mortgage on my house -- i
               had no idea --

     angle on two navy corpsmen, standing behind glass in the next room,
     monitoring beth and norman.

                         beth
               do yourself a favor, norman.  are you
               listening?  don't tell anyone what
               you just told me.

                         norman
               c'mon, beth -- that report's like
               the blind leading the blind.

                         beth
               because when we get down there --

                         norman
               wait -- down where?

                         beth
               to the spacecraft.  to investigate.

                         norman
               underwater?

                         beth
               what do you expect?  for them to
               bring it up here?

                         norman
               we can't go down there.  we're not
               prepared.  that deep?  that takes
               years of training, beth.  we're just
               scientists.  lab scietists.  we wear
               ties and lab coats to work -- not
               oxygen tanks.

                         beth
               well, you must have realized the
               chances an encounter like this would
               happen here.  in the ocean.
                    (off his look)
               70 percent of the earth's surface is
               water, norman.  that's first grade
               geography.

                         norman
               it never occurred to me.

                         beth
               well, let's pray that's the only
               mistake you made.  have you said
               anything to barnes about this?

                         norman
               the timing has never seemed quite
               right.

                         beth
               just keep your mouth shut, alright?
               this could mean everything to our
               careers, you know that?  don't
               jeopardize this.

                         norman
                    (nervous laughter)
               what -- are you threatening me?
