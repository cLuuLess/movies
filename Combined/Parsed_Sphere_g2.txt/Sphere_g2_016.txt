     int.  descent sub

     norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  seated in a
     circle area: ted, beth, harry, and arthur.  ahead of them, captain
     barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall
     of plexiglass.

     norman takes a seat between beth and ted.

                         barnes (o.s.)
                    (through the intercom)
               our descent will take 13 minutes.
               descending at a speed of 80 feet per
               minute.

     across from norman, harry is whispering something quietly into
     arthur's ear.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               pressure adjustments will cause the
               sub to lurch at times, but don't be
               alarmed.  it's perfectly normal...

     arthur's face drips with sweat, as harry continues to whisper into his
     ear.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               the sub's interior atmosphere will
               experience moisture as we descend,
               and the temperature will drop
               rapidly.  just relax and remain
               seated during the descent.

     norman watches arthur, dripping with sweat.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               we have clearing from the base.

     red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and we hear the sub
     make a hissing sound.  the sub lurches, and begins to lower in the
     water.

                         norman
               arthur?

     harry has gotten to arthur.  arthur is on the verge of panic.

                         norman
               arthur?  you alright?

                         arthur
               open the hatch door, please.

     harry continues to whisper in his ear.

                         arthur
               captain, open the hatch door, please
               ... the hatch door, captain.  open it,
               please.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               calm down, dr. levine.

                         arthur
               let me out, captain.  open the door!

                         barnes (o.s.)
               please, dr. levine.

     arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass
     wall.

                         barnes
                    (through the plexiglass)
               sit down, dr. levine!  you're in a
               military operation now --

     arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists.

                         barnes
               ... your civil rights have been
               overridden!

                         arthur
               open it, captain!

                         barnes
               dr. levine, please!  return to your
               seat!

     arthur vomits, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.

                         arthur
               open the fucking door!

     the sub lurches again, coming to a stop.  the compartment is totally
     silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.

     on harry smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at norman.

     the sub lurches again, and we hear clanking metal.  the hatch door
     opens.

     and arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and
     out the hatch door.

                         barnes (o.s.)
               anybody else?

     silence.

     the hatch door locks, loudly.  the sub lurches, and begins descending.

                         ted
               pussy.

                         beth
               what's that -- mistake number two,
               norman?

                         norman
               he wasn't feeling well.

                         ted
               he's a pussy.

     harry is still staring at norman...

                         harry
               how are you feeling, norman?

                         norman
               what?

                         harry
               you holding up alright?

                         norman
               fine.  i'm fine.

                         harry
               don't be defensive.

                         norman
               i'm not being defensive.

                         harry
               you sound defensive.

                         norman
               i'm fine.

                         ted
                    (to harry)
               what'd you say to him?

                         harry
               to who?  arthur?  nothing.  nothing
               that norman doesn't already know.

                         ted
               what does norman already know?

                         harry
               norman thinks we shouldn't be going
               down.  thinks it's a mistake.

     norman looks over at beth.

                         harry
               she told me what you said, norman.

                         ted
               what is it, harry?

                         harry
               just one of norman's many secrets.

     on norman, saying nothing.
