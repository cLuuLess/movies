     int.  corridor

     norman and beth running... 

                         beth
               harry!

     bang!  water shoots through the wall.  gushing out onto the floor.  the
     walls cracking.

     on harry -- running out of his room... 

                         harry
               what is it?

                         norman
               you know what it is, harry.

     bang!  they lose their balance, still running... 

                         norman
               it's the squid!  stop it!

                         harry
               stop what?  what are you -- ?

     bang!  another crack -- water gushing inside.

                         norman
               you know damn well what.  you're
               doing it!

     norman grabs harry, pushes him up against the wall.

                         harry
               doing what?  i'm not doing
               anything -- !

     beth takes the syringe from her palm, and stabs harry in the shoulder.

     he screams in horrifying pain, fading over into...
