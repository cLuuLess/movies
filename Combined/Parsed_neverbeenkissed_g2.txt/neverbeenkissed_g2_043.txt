               int. - high school hallway - day

               josie and aldys, both wearing big orange denominator 
               sweatshirts, are behind a table manning a bake sale.

               a banner behind them says: n = 3.14578697786978 pie = $.75

               no one is stopping to buy anything. josie points to the 
               left, aldys looks, and josie stuffs a whole brownie in her 
               mouth. they laugh uncontrollably as josie starts to choke 
               and cough up most of the brownie.

               we pan down a row of nervous looking denominator faces as 
               they watch josie, sitting head to head against a digit, an 
               opposing math-a-lon competitor. they both work furiously 
               on a problem. a judge sits between them. a makeshift 
               scoreboard hanging off the desk shows the score is tied.

               josie bangs the bell on the desk and hands the judge her 
               card. he looks it over, and gives her team five points. 
               they win.

               the denominators erupt into cheers. they're jumping all 
               over josie, going crazy. as we go wider we see the gym is 
               entirely empty, except for a handful of denominators going 
               crazy on one side, and a janitor sweeping up on the other.
