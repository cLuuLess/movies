               josie and her enormous bookbag enter. she takes a seat 
               toward the back of the room.

               kristen, kirsten and gibby, another beauty, enter and head 
               to the back of the room.

               kirsten and gibby stand over josie, staring at her.

                                     kirsten
                         we sit here.

                                     josie
                         oh. sorry--i didn't know these 
                         were assigned.

                                     gibby
                         they're not.

               josie quickly gathers her things and moves one row forward, 
               next to two empty seats. two stoners shuffle over to josie.

                                     stoner 1
                         sorry. we sit here.

                                     josie
                              (indicating two 
                              empty seats)
                         couldn't you two--sit there?

                                     stoner 2
                         right. except there are three of 
                         us--

               the stoners eye each other, then the two seats. a look of 
               horror comes over stoner 1.

                                     stoner 1
                         dude--we left jed at the 7-11!
                              (beat)
                         again!

               josie picks up her stuff, moves to the last empty seat in 
               the room-in the front row, surrounded by "" who all wear 
               orange denominator sweatshirts.

               sitting next to josie is aldys, a denominator--intense, 
               wise, with a whole bunch of math medals on her sweatshirt. 
               she smiles at josie.

               josie smiles back and looks up as mr. coulson enters the 
               room. he's a ruggedly handsome twenty-something yale grad.

               he grabs a notebook out of his bag, goes around to sit on 
               the front of his desk, sipping coffee from a styrofoam 
               cup.

                                     sam
                         hi, everyone.
                              (spots josie)
                         i don t think we've met. i'm sam 
                         coulson- although for some reason 
                         the school has this thing about 
                         not letting you guys call me sam.

                                     josie
                              (shyly)
                         i'm josie. geller. i think the 
                         school would probably be pretty 
                         comfortable with you calling, me 
                         that. josie.

               sam smiles.

                                     sam
                         josie since you're new--i love to 
                         drink my coffee during class, and 
                         since i allow myself to do this, i 
                         allow everyone to bring beverages 
                         to class as well.
                              (a beat)
                         welcome to shakespeare's "as you 
                         like it."
                              (beat)
                         okay. how many of you actually 
                         read the assignment last night?

               about five hands go up.

                                     sam
                         not bad. now how many of you spent 
                         more than thirty minutes eating 
                         salty snack foods?

               twenty hands. sam laughs.

                                     sam
                         man. if i could just get you guys 
                         to read while you eat.

               sam opens his book. aldys notices josie has no book. she 
               moves next to her.

                                     aldys
                         here. we can share.

               they share a smile.

                                     sam
                         'as you like it" is an example of 
                         a shakespearean--

               sam turns to the blackboard and starts writing. we cu on 
               his butt, hardly discernable in his loose 501 jeans, all 
               the girls swoon.

                                     sam
                         pastoral comedy. anyone know what 
                         that means?

               an enthusiastic, if slightly dim girl, sera, waves her 
               hand.

                                     sera
                         oh oh oh! that's what they do to 
                         milk!

                                     sam
                         that's pasteurize, sera. but close. 
                         same letter--
                              (tapping three 
                              fingers on his arm 
                              a la charades)
                         --three syllables--

                                     sera
                         parakeet?!

                                     aldys:
                              (sotto to josie)
                         there's a minute of my life i'll 
                         never get back.

               josie smiles at this.

                                     sam
                         okay, anyone else---

               josie can't contain herself.

                                     josie
                         pastoral means set in the country. 
                         originally seen in the eclogues of 
                         virgil. it's from the latin pascere. 
                         to graze.

               student bleets like a sheep o.s. sam just stares at her, 
               smiling. finally, he walks over and shakes her hand.

                                     sam
                         did i mention to the class that i 
                         love our new student?

               josie beams.

                                     gibby
                         did i mention that the class also 
                         loves our new kiss ass?

               josie's smile quickly fades.

                                     sam
                         gibby, that's not exactly the kind 
                         of participation i'm looking for.

               gibby looks right at josie.

                                     gibby
                              (totally insincere)
                         ooops. sorry.

               josie just sits there, face burning.
