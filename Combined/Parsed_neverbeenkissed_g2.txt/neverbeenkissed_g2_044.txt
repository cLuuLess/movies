               int. mall book store - day

               smiling at each other, josie and aldys clutch books 
               excitedly and stand in line. we widen to reveal they're in 
               line with nerdy adults also clutching their books. at the 
               head of the line is a blow-up poster for the new elements 
               of grammar. an old man signs books for his fans.
