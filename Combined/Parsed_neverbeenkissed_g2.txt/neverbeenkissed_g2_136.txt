               int. country club - continuous

               we pan across the dance floor where we see popeye & olive 
               oyl, sonny & cher, the blues brothers.

               we hold on robin dancing with batgirl. batman approached 
               and taps robin's shoulder--

                                     batman
                         may i have this dance-

               and batgirl steps aside--robin and batman dance happily 
               away.

               angle on rob trying to slow dance with tracy

               (dressed like rebecca de mornay), but she is so-drunk she's 
               having trouble balancing.

                                     tracy
                         are you having fun?

                                     rob
                         yeah. definitely.

               he tries to stand her up on her own.

                                     tracy
                         good. gibby gave me champagne.

                                     rob
                         maybe we should sit.

               he helps her to a chair next to the dance floor. they both 
               sit. next to them, a ravenous miss piggy eats with her 
               date kermit looking on. she picks up an hors d'oeuvre and 
               stares at it horrified.

                                     miss piggy
                         oh my god! is this a pig in a 
                         blanket?!

               tracy looks at rob, and gets serious.

                                     tracy
                         rob, i've - i've thought about it 
                         a lot. and i think- i mean, i know. 
                         you're the one. my penguin.

               rob looks at her. she's young. she's beautiful. she's tipsy. 
               she's trying to put her legs behind her head.

                                     rob
                         wow - i-

                                     tracy
                         rob, i mean it. i want you to be 
                         my first. me and you. once the 
                         floor stops spinning, let's have 
                         sex.

               he looks around. it's high school prom. a skinny kid is 
               getting beat up in a corner. other kids are sneaking smokes. 
               he can't do this.

                                     rob
                         i'm gonna get you some water. and 
                         then, i think we should get back 
                         out on that dance floor and boogie.

               rob gets up, kisses tracy on the top of her head, and heads 
               for the refreshment table. tracy, her leg still around her 
               head falls backwards into kermit's lap. kermit looks down, 
               surprised and interested. miss piggy notices, gives him a 
               big "harumph", tosses her hair, and leaves.

               angle back on: the cool table.

               gibby is staring o.s. in horror.

                                     gibby
                         you guys--what is the one thing 
                         that could ruin my senior prom?

                                     kristen
                         that you would trip on your barbie 
                         heels and i'd get named prom queen?
                              (beat)
                         did i say that out loud?

               we follow kristen's stare to the prom entrance where aldys 
               and the denominators enter in pairs, one behind the other, 
               attached together with rope, to form a human ladder. they 
               cross the dance floor, interrupting everything with their 
               unwieldy, tied-together conga line. they approach the cool 
               table.

                                     gibby
                         so what are you supposed to be? 
                         other than freaks?

                                     aldys
                         we're dna. a double helix. but i 
                         guess you'd know that if you'd 
                         actually passed bio.

               kristen reaches out and touches the rope binding denominator 
               #1 to aldys. denominator #1 slaps her hand away.

                                     denominator #1
                         please don't touch the hydrogen. 
                         it's rented.

               kristen reacts.
