               ext. track - high school - dusk

               in the middle of the track is josie's car. the marching 
               band clumsily practices their formations around it. josie 
               and aldys arrive at the car and aldys pops the hood.

                                     aldys
                         they love to disconnect the battery, 
                         too.

               she looks under the hood, reconnects the battery. slams 
               the hood down.

                                     aldys
                         just so you know, i think they 
                         recalled these cars in 1974.

                                     josie
                         thanks.

                                     aldys
                         sure. no problem.

               aldys heads to the lot for her car, and then turns around.

                                     aldys
                         hey, josie, how are you at calculus?

                                     josie
                         petty good.

                                     aldys
                         how would you like to join the 
                         denominators? the math team could 
                         really use a new brain. we lost 
                         our best logarithm guy last year.

                         college?

                         nasa.

                         plus we have these really fun pizza 
                         study groups, and we go to-these 
                         all county meets. and, i mean, not 
                         that you need it, and without 
                         sounding too much like the 
                         godfather, i think we could offer 
                         you a certain amount of protection", 
                         if you know what i mean. we all 
                         kind of stick together and watch 
                         out for each other.

               josie smiles.
