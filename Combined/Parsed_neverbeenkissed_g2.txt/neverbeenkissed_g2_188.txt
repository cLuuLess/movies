               music up: the beach boys "and then i kissed her" as josie 
               and sam continue to kiss as the camera pulls up, taking in 
               the kiss, the crowd, the stadium... camera spins up as 
               fireworks go off above the stadium... and we watch as the 
               stadium becomes a speck against the glittering backdrop of 
               chicago.
