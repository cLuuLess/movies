               ext. baseball, stadium parking lot  night

               cars begin to fill the parking lot in a steady stream.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         and so i propose this - as an ending 
                         to this article, and, perhaps, as 
                         an ending to this portion of my 
                         life. i, josie geller, will be at 
                         the state championship baseball 
                         game  where my friends the 
                         southglen rams are playing for the 
                         title.
