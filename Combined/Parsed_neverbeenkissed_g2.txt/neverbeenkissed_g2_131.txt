               ext. country club - night

               prom night. and it really is magical. twinkling lights dot 
               the trees, music wafts out from the club. a neon sign that 
               says "meant for each other" blinks above the building.- 
               couples make their way inside. we see mork a mindy, antony 
               a cleopatra and sera dressed as a rabbit. annoyed, she 
               turns back to her lagging date, brett, dressed as a 
               tortoise.

                                     sera
                         hello! if you don't hurry up we're 
                         gonna miss the whole thing!

               gibby, kirsten, and kristen exit limos with their dates. 
               they all wear the same straight blonde wig, and look at 
               each other in horror.

                                     gibby
                         oh-my-god. you totally ripped off 
                         my malibu barbie idea.

                                     kristen

               kirsten's wearing a short, tight miniskirt.

                                     kirsten
                         and i'm evening gown barbie.

                                     gibby
                         right. that's not an evening gown.

                                     kirsten
                         it is on barbie.

               they look great.

                                     kristen
                         josie, you look rufus.

                                     kirsten
                         who are you guys?

                                     gibby

                         barbie.

                                     josie
                         rosalind and orlando.
                              (nothing)
                         from "as you like it"?
                              (more blank stares)
                         shakespeare?

               it's like talking to a sack of hammers. guy interjects.

                                     guy
                         look! i get to have a sword!

               and they all ooh and ahh.
