               josie walks toward her locker, the make out couple is at 
               it again. josie's fed up. she taps the boy on his shoulder.

                                     josie
                         excuse me. hi. do you guys have 
                         some kind of schedule i could work 
                         around?

               he ignores josie and goes back to his girlfriend.

               aldys, in her denominator sweatshirt decorated with pins, 
               approaches josie.

                                     aldys
                         hey, where's your sweatshirt?

                                     josie
                          uhh, must have forgotten-

                                     aldys
                         no biggie. i have an extra in my 
                         locker. i'll get it for you.

               she starts to leave.

                                     aldys
                         oh  i almost forgot  i'll see 
                         you tonight at big cup. 7:30, right?

               josie looks confused.

                                     aldys
                         remember, that poet that we liked 
                          the reading he's doing at big 
                         cup? i got us tickets.

                                     josie
                         right. 7:30.

                                     aldys
                         i'm late for lab.

               aldys takes off. josie looks down the hall, where guy, 
               kristen and the others are all looking at a flyer pasted 
               to the wall.

                                     guy
                         that is gonna be such a sweet show. 
                         i am so there.

               guy looks at tommy and jason, who f follow his lead.

                                     tommy
                         oh, yeah, man, i'll drive.

                                     jason
                         it's gonna be rufalicious.

                                     guy
                              (beat)
                         you're using it wrong.

               they head off, en masse. josie goes and looks at the flyer: 
               "jimmy cliff tonight at delloser hall". josie smiles.
