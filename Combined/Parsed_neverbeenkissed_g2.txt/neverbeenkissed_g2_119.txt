               rigfort presides over a staff meeting. close up on stunned 
               office workers' faces.

                         alrighty then--next on the agenda-
                         sack races at the company picnic-
                         yes or no?

               josie sneaks in. she pushes past workers to get to a chair, 
               big backpack whacking them as she goes.

                                     josie
                         hi. sorry i'm late.
                              (pushing past chairs)
                         sorry. excuse me--

               josie takes the chair next to anita's. anita looks her up 
               and down.

                                     anita
                              (sotto)
                         i love that jacket.

                         miss geller, what's the status on 
                         your story?

                                     josie
                         oh it's great. totally rufus.

               gus and anita look at each other, both mouthing "rufus?"

                                     josie
                         i have, um--

               josie dumps out her backpack on the table. teen items spill 
               out-notebooks, cds, barrettes, a hacky sac, a frisbee, 
               glitter nail polish. she rifles through it all--

                                     josie
                         --notes here somewhere-
                              (picking up paper)
                         there's my math homework!

                                     rigfort
                         geller, i don't need your notes. i 
                         need your story. though i speak 
                         for everyone when i say i've seen 
                         the tapes. compelling stuff.

               all the workers nod in agreement.

                                     rigfort
                         but i want a story in two weeks. 
                         i'm saving the "life and style" 
                         cover for you. you're gonna make 
                         one hell of a reporter. oh, and if 
                         you don't, you and gus are fired.

               josie and gus react.

                                     rigfort
                         now, onto the next order of 
                         business. marketing department-yes
