               ext. a baseball stadium -- night

               it's packed. reporters line the field. all eyes are on 
               josie.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         this is so not a dream.

               the stadium clock sets at 5:00. the crowd goes crazy. josie 
               takes a deep, nervous breath and smiles, "oh god."
