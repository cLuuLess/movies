               josie walks out of gus's office, continues, determined, 
               towards the elevators. anita falls into step with her.

                                     anita
                         josie! josie, how'd it go? did he 
                         ream you?

               josie walks past merkin's desk. she holds out her hand to 
               merkin.

                                     josie
                         merkin. highlighter.

               merkin slaps a highlighter into her hand, she continues 
               on. anita watches her go.
