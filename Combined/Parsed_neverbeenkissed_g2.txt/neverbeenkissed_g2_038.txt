               ext. parking lot - same

               kids fill the parking lot. josie walks, talking on her 
               cell phone.

                                     josie
                              (into phone)
                         rhoda, make sure gus gets-the whole 
                         message, okay? yeah--bye--

               josie arrives where she parked bambi. the space is empty. 
               she still holds the phone to her ear--

                                     josie
                         wait a second--
                              (into phone)
                         no, not you--bye--

               josie shuts the phone, looks around...retraces her steps 
               ... bambi is gone.

               josie walks around the lot, getting visibly upset.

               in the corner of the lot, we see a group of denominators 
               removing a big metal chain from around a group of tightly 
               packed cars.

                                     aldys (o.s.)
                         they do it to all the new kids.

               josie finds aldys standing next to her.

                                     josie
                         who's of they?

               aldys motions up to a second floor window. guy and his 
               group look down on them, laughing.

                                     aldys
                         guy perkins and his amazing 
                         lemmings. they push your car out 
                         of its space, hide it, then watch 
                         while you look for it. we've taken 
                         to chaining ours together for 
                         safety. i'm aldys.

                                     josie
                         i'm josie. aldys is an interesting 
                         name.

                                     aldys
                         when it's not yours. my mom was 
                         going through her harlequin romance 
                         phase.

                                     josie
                         try being named after a guitar-
                         playing pussycat.

               aldys doesn't get it.

                                     josie
                         never mind.
                              (beat)
                         that is so awful that they hide 
                         your cars.

                                     aldys
                         guess. although, what is truly 
                         awful is that with the combined 
                         intellectual effort of every kid 
                         in that room right now-

               she points up to the biology room-

                                     aldys
                         they still would not know the 
                         difference between a synecdoche 
                         and a hyperbole.

               josie laughs.

                                     josie
                         i know. it's pathetic.

               aldys stares josie down.

                                     josie
                         what?

                                     aldys
                         well, do you?

                                     josie
                         synecdoche uses a part to represent 
                         a whole- as in " head of cattle", 
                         whereas a hyperbole is simple 
                         exaggeration like "i could eat a 
                         horse."

                                     aldys
                         nice.

               they stop and look around.

                                     josie
                         how long will they watch us for?

                                     aldys
                         until guy tells them to go. once 
                         they watched me for like two hours. 
                         i found my car the next day in the 
                         t.j. maxx parking lot.

                                     josie
                         why do they listen to guy?

                                     aldys:
                              (duh)
                         because he's guy perkins.
                              (then)
                         listen, you want to walk to na-
                         na's and get something to eat?

                                     josie
                         yeah. let's do that.

               they start to walk out of the parking lot. josie is visibly 
               thrilled - having finally found a friend.
