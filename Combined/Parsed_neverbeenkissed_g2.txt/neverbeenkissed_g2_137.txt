               int. country club - on the stage  later

                                     sam
                         well, the moment has arrived.

               he looks at the card.

                                     sam
                         our 1999 prom court - the princesses 
                         are - miss kristen rey, miss kirsten 
                         leosis and miss gibby zarefsky. 
                         and the princes are mr. thomas 
                         salamey, mr. jason way, and mr. 
                         rob -

               sam looks at the card, and then looks around. nobody can 
               help him.

                                     sam
                         mr. rob ... mr. rob!

               the crowd cheers. gibby, kirsten, and kristen all jump in 
               preplanned delight. rob seems genuinely surprised. jason 
               carries tommy up to the stage piggyback. the girls make 
               their way to the stage, and put on their "prom court" 
               sashes. sam looks to the card again.

                                     sam
                         next up - southglen's prom king

               guy is already halfway to the stage-

                                     sam
                         guy perkins!

               the crowd goes wild. guy reaches the stage and takes his 
               crown and scepter.

                                     sam
                         and - this year's prom queen -

               sam looks at the card, then at josie. josie is standing; 
               eyes open, staring at the podium...
