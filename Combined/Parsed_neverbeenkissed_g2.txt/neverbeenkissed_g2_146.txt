               ext. country club parking lot - moments later

               josie exits the club, looking for sam. george runs up to 
               her.

                                     george
                         hey--i lost the feed! what happened 
                         with coulson? gus is going crazy!

               out of the shadows emerges sam. the look on his face says 
               he just heard everything.

                                     josie
                         so--surprise!

               he shakes his head in disbelief and walks off. josie chases 
               after him. he turns back to her.

                                     sam
                         "surprise!" you were doing a story 
                         on me?!

                                     josie
                         no, surprise, i thought you'd be--

                                     sam
                         what? happy? why? because it turns 
                         out all along that i was allowed 
                         to be attracted to you?

                                     josie
                              (touched)
                         you were attracted to me?

                                     sam
                         goddamnit, josie! drop the act. do 
                         you have any idea what i went 
                         through every night because of 
                         you?!  i was attracted to a 17 
                         year old! when i wasn't taking 
                         cold showers, i was trying to figure 
                         out what the hell i was going to 
                         do when i couldn't teach anymore! 
                         i thought i was the one being 
                         unethical.

                                     josie
                         wait, i was going to tell you--

                                     sam
                         you set me up. for a story.
                              (beat)
                         you know what's crazy? i was 
                         actually considering waiting for 
                         you.

                                     josie
                         but now you don't have to--

                                     sam
                         now i don't want to! i bought all 
                         of your penguin crap. i thought i 
                         found her--the right one! and the 
                         problem was she was too young! no - 
                         the problem was--she didn't even 
                         exist!

                                     josie
                         i did exist. i do exist. i'm the 
                         same person!

                                     sam
                         the person i cared about wouldn't 
                         have done this. everything out of 
                         your mouth has been a complete 
                         lie. i don't know you at all. for 
                         all i know you could hate dorothy 
                         parker.

                                     josie
                         i don't! look, you could get to 
                         know me, again.

               sam turns and starts to walk away.

                                     josie
                         please. please don't walk away.

                                     sam
                         i just can't look at you the same 
                         way.

               sam gets into his car and drives off. josie is devastated.
