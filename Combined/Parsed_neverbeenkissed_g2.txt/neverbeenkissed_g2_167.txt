               int. sam's kitchen - morning

               the kitchen of a depressed guy--empty pizza boxes next to 
               a dying plant. sam pours milk into a bowl of lucky charms 
               while he reads the sports section of the paper.

                         a certain teacher was trampled in 
                         my path to self-discovery, and 
                         though this article may serve as a 
                         step, it in no way makes up for 
                         what i did to him.

               he's not paying attention and the milk overflows the bowl, 
               soaking the table.

                         to this man, you know who you are, 
                         i am so sorry.

               he takes the wet paper, using it like a sponge, he sops up 
               the remaining milk, and throws the paper into an open trash 
               can. he leaves the kitchen. we hold on the empty room.

                         and, i would like to add one more 
                         thing - i think i am in love with 
                         you.
