               int. school lobby - minutes later

               josie's stuff lays out on the post-detector table - cell 
               phone, laptop, mini tape recorder, electronic organizer, 
               pager, being scrutinized by the guard. josie's sure she's 
               been found out. camera widens. down from josie, we see 
               other kids' belongings spread out. they have the identical 
               high-tech equipment. the guard picks up josie's nail file, 
               examines it -

                                     guard
                         weapon.

               and throws it in the trash.
