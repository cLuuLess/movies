               int. dugout - same

               the team is dressed, ready, excited. anita and aldys stand 
               next to josie. josie looks up at the crowd, amazed.

                                     josie
                         wow. it's packed.

                                     anita
                         it's great! they're behind you. 
                         they feel like they know you.

                                     aldys
                         it's romantic, what you're doing, 
                         and they want to be a part of it.

                                     josie
                         well i'm so glad that you guys 
                         are.

               josie then starts to hyperventilate. she puts her head 
               between her ankles. anita and aldys both grab the brown 
               paper bag and hand it to josie. she hyperventilates into 
               it. coach romano approaches. josie puts the bag down.

                                     coach
                         sweet jesus, geller - i had no 
                         idea there'd be all these tv crews 
                         here. this thing's gonna be on 
                         every station in the country.

               josie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag 
               again.

                                     coach
                         you more than kept your end of the 
                         bargain. now go out there and get 
                         'em.

               josie gets up and he slaps her on the ass. she hugs aldys. 
               then anita gives josie a big hug, and won't let go. josie 
               has to pull anita pulls back. josie struggles to get out 
               of the hug- anita won't let her. finally, they are both 
               laughing.

               josie walks out of the dugout, and onto the field.
