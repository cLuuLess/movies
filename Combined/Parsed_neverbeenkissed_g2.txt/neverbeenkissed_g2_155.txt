               int. gus' office - day

               gus comes in, snaps on the light, sits at his desk, and 
               opens his newspaper. he pulls out, the "life and style" 
               section.

               and there it is. front page - "never been kissed by josie 
               geller."  there are three pictures next to the article. 
               one is josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture, 
               and one is her as a normal, 25 yr. old adult.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         high school was more of the same. 
                         then, at seventeen, it seemed as 
                         if my luck was about to change. 
                         the cutest guy in school asked me 
                         to senior prom - but it turned out 
                         he invited me as a cruel joke. i 
                         have never fully recovered.
