               josie is hugged and congratulated as she makes her way, 
               elated, to the stage. sam places the queen's tiara on her 
               head and hands her a bouquet of flowers. they lock eyes 
               for a moment.

                                     sam
                         and now - as it is custom - the 
                         king and queen will have their 
                         first dance.

               on the dance floor:

               guy and josie begin to dance. from josie's p.o.v., it's in 
               slow motion, the world glittering and wonderful around 
               her.

                                     guy
                         hey--what are you thinking about?

                                     josie
                         shakespeare. how he described a 
                         night like this--"look how the 
                         floor of heaven is thick inlaid 
                         with patines of bright gold".
                              (beat)
                         what about you? what are you 
                         thinking about?

                                     guy
                              (taking a beat, 
                              happily)
                         my sword.

               it's like a switch has been flicked on in josie's brain.

                                     josie
                         oh.

                                     guy
                         josie, you rock my world. you're 
                         like the most amazing girl i've 
                         ever dated. you're so smart and 
                         fun and crazy! you rock my world.

                                     josie
                         you said that already.
