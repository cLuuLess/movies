               ext. the ferris wheel - same

               we pan down the line of kids waiting to ride the ferris 
               wheel. in front are tommy, jason, gibby and kirsten.

                                     kirsten
                         this has been so much fun! we've 
                         been first in line for every ride!

                                     tommy
                         that's cuz we cut every line.

               we pan down to the end of the line, where we find josie, 
               standing alone. she's trying her best to keep her game 
               face on. the carny opens the gate, the kids pile onto the 
               ride, two by two. josie reaches an empty car--the last one--
               and gets in. the carny holds the safety bar open.

                                     carny
                         where's your partner?

                                     josie
                         i don't--i don't have one--

                                     carny
                              (yelling loudly)
                         i got a lonely ride in bucket seven!
                              (to crowd)
                         single!

                                     josie
                         do you have to yell like that?

               sam, standing by a vendor, looks over and notices josie's 
               predicament.

                                     tommy (o.s.)
                         of course it's loser that's holding 
                         up the ride!

               sam walks up to the josie's bucket.

                                     sam
                         this seat taken?

                                     josie
                              (relieved)
                         thank you.

               he gets in. the ride jerks into motion.

                                     sam
                              (nervous)
                         whoa.

               they start a slow ascent. sam seems ill at ease.

                                     josie
                         are you--scared?

                                     sam
                         i'm gonna tell you something here, 
                         and i hope it doesn't undermine my 
                         position as an authority figure. 
                         i'm a little afraid of heights.

                                     josie
                         you're afraid of the ferris wheel.

                                     sam
                         actually, it's more the plunging 
                         head first into the crowd part 
                         that gets me.

                                     josie
                         oh right. the spiderman incident.

                                     sam
                              (touched)
                         you remember that story?

                                     josie
                         of course. i remember everything 
                         from your class.

               they smile at each other. the smile is interrupted by a 
               heavy swaying of their bucket, caused by tommy rocking in 
               the bucket ahead. sam looks a little green.

                                     sam
                         yoooooow.

                                     josie
                         don't look down!

               they're facing the ground at this point.

                                     sam
                         out of my control.
                              (yelling to tommy)
                         tommy! cut it out! enough!

               tommy stops. sam turns to josie.

                                     sam
                              (defensive)
                         i said that as a chaperone.

               they start to ascend again. sam relaxes.

                                     sam
                         okay this is okay. smooth.
                              (then)
                         can i ask you something? do you 
                         think i tell too many stories in 
                         class?

                                     josie
                         that's what makes you interesting.
                              (beat, recovering)
                         as a teacher.

                                     sam
                         god, i would love to think i'm an 
                         interesting teacher. i mean, i had 
                         maybe one or two teachers in high 
                         school who had any passion at all.

                                     josie
                         you do. seem to. have passion. in 
                         the classroom.

                                     sam
                         you have to say that. you're my 
                         student.

                                     josie
                         i don't have to say that.

               they look into each other's eyes just as tommy rattles his 
               bucket ruthlessly.

                                     tommy (o.s.)
                         if the bucket's a-rockin', don't 
                         come-a knockin'.

               josie and sam laugh uncomfortably.

                                     sam
                         boys.

                                     josie
                         i know.

                                     sam
                         i'd like to tell you that we all 
                         grow out of it, but that's a lie. 
                         some of us will always be rattling 
                         cages.

                                     josie
                         why do you do that?

                                     sam
                         i don't know. and you know what's 
                         scary--when you get older it just 
                         gets more confusing. i've spent 
                         the last ten years with women who 
                         are basically all wrong for me.
                              (beat)
                         you know what, i shouldn't be 
                         talking about this stuff with you.

                                     josie
                         that's okay. it's nice to have 
                         someone to talk to--

               the bucket is rocked again by tommy--sam grips the safety 
               bar.

                                     sam
                              (as he rocks)
                         same here.

               they stop rocking but they're still stuck at the top.

                                     sam
                         all i can tell you is that when 
                         you're my age, the guys will be 
                         lined up around the block for you.

               they share a smile.

                                     josie
                              (suddenly shy)
                         you have to say that. you're my 
                         teacher.

                                     sam
                         i shouldn't say that, because i'm 
                         your teacher.

               they look at each other, their smiles fading into 
               realization. suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to 
               move down. josie and sam are pulled out of their reverie. 
               they smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laugh.

               wide shot of the ferris wheel as josie and sam descend.

                                     sam (v.o.)
                         thanks, josie. this wasn't as bad 
                         as i thought.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         when are you going to open your 
                         eyes?

                                     sam (v.o.)
                         i'm thinking when i'm home.
