               int. den - night (flashback)

               the den of josie's parents' home. josie is decked out. 
               she's wearing a pretty hideous metallic pink dress, matching 
               gloves, bag, shoes. she's shining her braces, using the 
               t.v. screen as a mirror. the phone rings. josie grabs it.

                                     josie
                              (into phone)
                         hey, billy. i'm ready. sure, i can 
                         just wait for you on the front 
                         porch. see you in a -uhh- jiffer.

               she hangs up. sixteen year old rob, very cute and buff, 
               enters. his pretty girlfriend is on his arm.

                                     girlfriend
                              (mouthing to rob)
                         jiffer?

               rob just shrugs.
