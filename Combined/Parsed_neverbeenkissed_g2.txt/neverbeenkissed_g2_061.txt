               int. george's van - moments later

               high-tech surveillance wonderland meets seventies living 
               room. tape players and monitors share space with shag 
               carpeting and a mini-fridge. barry white plays on a tape. 
               george starts to wrap wire around josie's waist. he pins a 
               kid's plastic "captain's wings" onto her collar.

                                     josie
                         what is this?

                                     george
                         hidden camera.

                                     josie
                         wings?

                                     george
                         we used it for our expose on 
                         overweight flight attendants--"is 
                         that why they never give you a 
                         second bag of nuts?"

                                     josie
                         i'm not doing this until i speak 
                         with gus.

                                     gus (o.s.)
                              (through speaker)
                         geller, stop being a pain in the 
                         ass.

               josie looks all around.

                                     josie
                         gus?

                                     gus (o.s.)
                         no, it's the great and powerful 
                         oz. now listen--you're in over 
                         your head. this is how it's gonna 
                         work. i review the tapes, i find 
                         your story.

                                     josie
                         what if i say no?

                                     gus (o.s.)
                         i bet good housekeeping would go 
                         gaga over the cole slaw piece.

               off josie's look of concern...
