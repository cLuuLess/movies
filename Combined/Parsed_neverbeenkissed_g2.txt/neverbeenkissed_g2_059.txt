               int. den - continuous

               josie storms into the den, and plants herself on the sofa. 
               she sees that rob has been watching baseball on t.v., and 
               she turns it off.

                                     josie
                         i can't do it. i thought i could. 
                         i can't. i give up--i'm never going 
                         to be a reporter.

               rob sits next to her on the couch. he looks up at the t.v.- 
               which is now off.

                                     rob
                         did you catch the score?

               josie gives him a look of death.

                                     rob
                         no, i mean, no big whoop.

                                     josie
                         i can't do this.

               she pulls the article out of her purse, and shoves it at 
               rob. he sees the picture of all the popular kids at the 
               court.

                                     rob
                         these girls are high schoolers? 
                         damn, we've got some underage 
                         hotties on our hands, here!

                                     josie
                         gus insists that i become friends 
                         with these kids. the popular kids. 
                         it's impossible.

                                     rob
                         why is that impossible?

               josie's eyes get teary.

                                     josie
                         rob, you don't know how it was for 
                         me back in high school. no one 
                         ever threw juice boxes at you in 
                         the hallway. you never dreamed 
                         about being popular- you already 
                         were. all i wanted was to be 
                         accepted, and they just fucking 
                         tortured me. i can't do all that 
                         again. i can't go back to southglen 
                         south.

                                     rob
                         oh my god! you're at southglen 
                         south? they have a killer baseball 
                         team.

                                     josie
                         rob. please focus.

               he puts his arm around her.

                                     rob
                         jos, you've been to college, you're 
                         successful, you wash your hair now-- 
                         you're not josie grossie anymore.

                                     josie
                         don't you realize how much i wanted 
                         to be you in high school? just for 
                         one minute to feel what it was 
                         like to be popular?

                                     rob
                         come on! it's not that hard. all 
                         you need is one person. once the 
                         right person thinks you're cool, 
                         you're in. everyone else will be 
                         too scared to question it.

                                     josie
                         is that true?

                                     rob
                         little known fact.

               josie takes this in.

                                     rob
                         look, don't you wanna show them - 
                         gus, billy prince, yourself--that 
                         you're not freaked out by the cool 
                         kids anymore? that you can go in 
                         there, be friends with them, and 
                         get your story?

                                     josie
                         yes, desperately.

                                     rob
                         plus, if you quit you're no better 
                         than me.

                                     josie
                         better than i...

                                     rob
                         that's the spirit!
