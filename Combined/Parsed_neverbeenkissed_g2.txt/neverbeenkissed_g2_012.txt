               josie's shiny buick is parked right behind bambi at the 
               curb.

                         it's just for a couple of months.

                         you can't just "borrow" my car for 
                         a couple of months! that's like 
                         ten years in bambi life!

                         i'll give you my buick le sabre.

               rob rolls his eyes and enters the store.
