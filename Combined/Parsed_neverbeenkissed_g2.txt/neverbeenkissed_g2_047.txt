               int. classroom - day (flasheack)

               angle back to josie, now seventeen and mortified, nervously 
               standing in class and reading a poem. billy prince sits to 
               the side--she glances at him throughout the poem, it's 
               clearly about him.

                                     josie
                         does he notice me? does he hear my 
                         heart screaming his name-- sometimes 
                         it's so loud i think the gods can 
                         hear my pain. his voice is so 
                         mellifluous, oh to get just one 
                         small kiss.

               the class laughs at her except for billy, who smiles at 
               her, looking slightly touched.
