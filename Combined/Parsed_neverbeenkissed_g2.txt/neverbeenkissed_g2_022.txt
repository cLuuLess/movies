               ext. south glen south high schoool - morning

               a suburban campus anchored by a main building. cars pull 
               into the parking lot for the beginning of the day. kids 
               greet each other, converge on the front doors of the school. 
               general mayhem.

               bambi pulls in. she jerks into a spot, backfiring once 
               more for effect. the entire scene stops. kids freeze, look 
               at josie. a beat, and they they continue on their way.
