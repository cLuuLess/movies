               ext. baseball field - night

               the southglen rams baseball team minus rob, are on the 
               field, warming up.

                                     josie (v.o.)
                         i will stand on the pitcher's mound 
                         for the five minutes prior to the 
                         first pitch. if this man accepts 
                         my apology, i ask him to come to 
                         kiss me, in front of everyone, for 
                         my first real kiss.

               we find a nervous looking josie standing in the dugout.

                         five minutes may seem like a short 
                         time, but trust me, when you've 
                         been waiting twenty-five years, 
                         it's usually the last five minutes 
                         that kill you.

                         i went back to high school and 
                         discovered i was a loser, again.
