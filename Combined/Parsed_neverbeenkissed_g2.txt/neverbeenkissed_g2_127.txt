               int. gus's office - later

               gus and josie sit in front of his tv. the image of sam and 
               josie is frozen on the screen.

                                     gus
                         that's your story!

                                     josie
                         you're crazy. i can't--i can't-no. 
                         no.

                                     gus
                         it's got it all--sex, intrigue, 
                         immorality in the education system--

                                     josie
                         he's my teacher!

                                     gus
                         and that's the best part.
                              (bannering with his 
                              hands)
                         "teacher-student relations: how 
                         close is too close?" we're gonna 
                         blow the lid off it!

                                     josie
                         there is no lid! nothing's going 
                         on between sam and me. coulson. 
                         mr. sam coulson and me.

                                     gus
                         not yet. every person in this office 
                         comes in here and watches you guys!  
                         it's like the goddamn young and 
                         the restless! rigfort's salivating 
                         over it.

                                     josie
                         you already pitched this to 
                         rigfort?!

               gus leans in, now all business.

                                     gus
                         josie, this isn't a joke. you heard 
                         rigfort. it's both of our asses on 
                         the line. this is your story.
