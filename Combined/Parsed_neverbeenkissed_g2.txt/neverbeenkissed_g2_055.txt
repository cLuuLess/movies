                         have you ever wanted to go to the 
                         court?

                                     aldys
                         are you kidding, josie? it's lame. 
                         all they do is stand around and 
                         get drunk. it's lame.

                                     josie
                         it is?

                                     aldys
                         yes, it's lame.

                                     josie
                         yeah, it sounds lame. why would we 
                         want to go there, and stand around?

                                     aldys
                         exactly.
