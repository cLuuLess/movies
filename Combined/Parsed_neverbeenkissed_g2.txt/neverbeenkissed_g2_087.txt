               ext. josie's front porch night (flashback)

               josie, in all her prom splendor, waits out on the front 
               porch for her date.

               she sees a long, black limo turn the corner, headed for 
               the house. she's hopping up and down with excitement. she 
               checks her reflection in her compact, and then watches the 
               limo approach.

               the sunroof of the limo opens and billy prince, the adonis 
               of the suburbs, stands up, sticking out of the sunroof. he 
               waves. josie smiles and waves back.

               then, another figure joins billy's. it's a gorgeous blonde 
               in a slinky dress. she's standing up, sticking out of the 
               sunroof as well. josie looks a bit confused, but still 
               tries to smile. then, she sees them holding things. little 
               things. little white things.

               before josie realizes what's going on, her metallic ensemble 
               is covered in dripping, oozing eggs. one whacks her right 
               in her trifocals.

                                     billy
                              (shouting)
                         hey, write a poem about this!

               billy and his date lob a few more eggs, and their limo 
               roars off. josie stands on the porch, alone. she's got egg 
               in her hair, on her face, all over her dress- everywhere. 
               she starts to cry. softly at first, moving into big, loud, 
               wet sobs. she sits down on the porch, her head in her hands, 
               and just keeps crying.

                                                       dissolve back to:
