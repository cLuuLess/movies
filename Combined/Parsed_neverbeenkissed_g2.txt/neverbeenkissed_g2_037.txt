               int. high school hallway - later

               it's - finally- the end of the day. josie makes her way 
               down the hall, clutching her pad of paper, getting pushed 
               and shoved by kids as they storm outside. a huge banner 
               hangs overhead reading: "sign up for senior night!"

               she tries to smile at some kids, but they all ignore her.

               she makes it to the main entrance to the school, where we 
               see, as she shoves her pad of paper into her bag, it is 
               completely blank.
