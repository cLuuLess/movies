               int. club/delloser hall - same

               jimmy cliff is playing. the crowd sits at tables, grooving. 
               josie approaches the bar. a guy turns around--it's sam.

                                     sam
                         josie--out on a school night.

               a woman, lara, emerges from the crowd. and puts her arm 
               around sam. an awkward beat.

                                     lara
                         hi.

                                     josie
                         hi.

                                     sam
                         oh, right, sorry. lara--josie. 
                         josie--lara.
                              (to lara)
                         josie's a student of mine.
                              (to josie)
                         lara's my-date.

                                     lara
                         nice to meet you.

               another awkward pause.

                                     lara
                         c'mon, c'mon, let's go dance.

               the crowd roars over cliff's next song as lara drags san 
               off into the crowd. sam looks back briefly at josie as we 
               lose him into the crowd.

               angle on josie

               she sees guy's group sitting at a table and approaches an 
               empty seat. they immediately scoot around so that the seat 
               is taken. undeterred, josie sees a seat at the next table 
               and sits down in it. she looks up to see that she is at a 
               table of huge rastafarians. they all wear big rasta hats 
               and even bigger hair and are smoking a joint the size of 
               cuba. she smiles awkwardly.

                                     josie
                         hi. is it okay if i sit here?

                                     rasta #1
                         oh, ya mon. we accept all peoples. 
                         we are all about da' love.

               josie and the rasta's start to groove to the music. josie 
               looks over at guy's table, sees they are toking off a small 
               joint and passing it around.
