               int. high school library - day (flashback)

               seventeen-year-old josie is surrounded by an elaborate, 
               color-coded index card system for her research paper.

               her friend, sheila, over-weight and pimply, comes running 
               across the library at breakneck speed. she sits down next 
               to josie, visibly excited and pushes her index cards aside.

                                     sheila
                         o.k., what have you wanted for 
                         like ever but you didn't think it 
                         would -ever happen?

               josie looks at her for a moment, mulling it over.

                                     josie
                         that they'd start an olympic team 
                         for grammar - like diagramming 
                         sentences and verb declensions and 
                         stuff. and i'm scouted for the 
                         team- just as an alternate, of 
                         course- because i'm so young. but 
                         then there's talk of me in the '96 
                         games-

                                     sheila.
                         no-, better. something better

               josie smiles.

                                     josie
                         i'm the most popular girl in school, 
                         and billy prince is taking me to 
                         prom.

               josie laughs at the absurdity. she looks at sheila. sheila 
               is dead serious.

                                     sheila
                         yes.

                                     josie
                         what?

                                     sheila
                         billy prince is asking you to prom.

                                     josie
                         why?

                                     sheila
                         i don't know.

                                     josie
                              (beat)
                         the poem! i knew he liked the poem!
                              (all sinking in)
                         billy prince is asking me to the 
                         prom.

                                     sheila
                         that's what i'm saying.

               the two girls look at each other. big smiles erupt into 
               screams, as they jump up and down, hugging each other.

               sfx - the bell rings.
