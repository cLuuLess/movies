               int. classroom - same

               sam still sits at his desk. he reads a book. josie enters.

                                     sam
                         whoa. deja vu.

                                     josie
                         sorry. forgetful.

               josie picks up her bookbag. she notices the book sam's 
               reading--

                                     josie
                              (excited)
                         dorothy parker--

                                     sam
                         you like her?

                                     josie
                         i love the way she writes.

                                     sam
                         not the happiest of souls.
                              (reading out of 
                              book)
                         "art is a form of catharsis, and 
                         love is a permanent flop."

                                     josie
                         but i think she wanted to be happy, 
                         that's why she wrote. i mean, she 
                         was still writing about love, right?

                                     sam
                         true. i guess she hadn't completely 
                         given up hope.
                              (then)
                         are you sure you're seventeen?

                                     josie
                         sure, why?

                                     sam
                         because seventeen-year-olds do not 
                         like writers from the '30's. they 
                         don't even like people in their 
                         30's.

                                     josie
                         well, i'm definitely seventeen and
                              (off clock)
                         now definitely late--

               and she smiles and runs out.
