               ext. front porch - same

               josie comes out on the porch, and sees the limo rounding 
               the corner, just like eight years before. the sunroof opens. 
               and guy stands up - holding something.

               josie panics - and starts to take cover - but then sees 
               he's holding a dozen white roses. and holding them out to 
               her.

                                     guy
                         come on beautiful - what are you 
                         waiting for?

               josie, smiling, runs down the driveway to the limo.
