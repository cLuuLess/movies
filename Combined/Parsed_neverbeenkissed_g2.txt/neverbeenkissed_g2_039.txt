               int. na-na's - later

               josie and aldys share a huge plate of chili fries.

                                     aldys
                         yeah - isn't it amazing that those 
                         guys are our same age? i mean, 
                         they just seem so much younger, 
                         you know.

                                     josie
                         oh i know.

               a waiter delivers two huge chocolate shakes.

                                     aldys
                         i'm going to be so happy to get to 
                         college. i hear at northwestern 
                         they don't make fun of you for 
                         knowing the element table.

                                     josie
                         hey--i went to northwestern!
                              (a beat)
                         once. to use the bathroom.

               out the window, josie sees her buick with rob at the wheel 
               stopped at a red light. detailed on to the side in big 
               white script is: "the tiki post". 

               josie's eyes widen. the light changes. rob pulls away.

                                     josie
                              (so angry)
                         oh. my. god.
                              (a beat)
                         you'll really like northwestern.

               they both slurp down their shakes.

                                     josie
                         so what are your hopes, your dreams, 
                         what do you want to be?

                                     aldys
                         professor of medieval literature. 
                         novelist. weekend flautist.

               aldys takes another slurp of her shake. we hear a muffled 
               cell phone ringing.

                                     aldys
                         i think your knapsack is ringing.

               josie takes the cell phone out of her knapsack and answers 
               it.

                                     josie
                         hello?
