               int. high school hallway - later

               josie shuffles down the hall, still wearing her cheesy 
               green and yellow gym clothes. she is clearly beaten. she 
               looks down the hall, stunned.

               it is ridiculous rob is being followed by a posse, everyone 
               knows his name. girls tug on his shirt, guys slap him on 
               the back or high-five him.

                                     jason
                         hey, rob.

                                     tommy
                         robster, what's up?

                                     brett
                         the rob man. my man rob.

                                     gibby
                         hey, robbie.

                                     kristen
                         hi there robbie rob.

               josie sees guy approach rob, and shake his hand.

                                     guy
                         hey robo- how's it going?

                                     rob
                         nice pants, man. they are rufus.

               guy smiles. josie looks like she's going to hurl. she looks 
               down the hall the other way- where a huge banner hangs 
               that reads:

               "impeach sydney anakowski. elect rob student body president.

                                     tracy
                         hey rob, see you at the carnival 
                         later?

                                     stoner 1
                         it's robilicious!

               josie looks on the wall next to her- and sees a list:

               "final cast list for hamlet. hamlet . . . rob."

                                     josie
                         oh, please.

               josie has seen enough, and walks on.
