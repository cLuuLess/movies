               ext. pitcher's mound - same

               josie stands, clutching the mic. the clock reads: 10.

                                     crowd
                         ten - nine - eight - seven - six -

               josie stands there, head still held high.

                                     crowd
                         five - four - three - two -

               josie steals a look to the dugout. no one is coming out 
               the door.

                                     crowd
                         one!!

               josie makes one more desperate look around. no one is 
               running toward her.

               close up on josie, completely crestfallen. she drops the 
               microphone. it reverbs in the silent stadium.

               we pan across the crowd, all defeated. and then...

               a commotion in the stands. sam bursts through the crowd. 
               he runs toward the mound. the crowd is on their feet.

               it feels like a lifetime before he reaches josie, grabs 
               her, pulls her close to him.

                                     sam
                         i told you you could write, josie 
                         geller.

                                     josie
                         i finally found my story.

               and they kiss passionately. the most amazing, most waited-
               for kiss in the history of man. a kiss that will last 
               forever.
