               karen stands in the doorway, surveying the room.   the place
               is in a complete state of disarray.
          
               a scraping sound grabs karen's attention.
          
               her pov: at the far end of the room, a frosted-glass paneled
               door leads to an adjacent room.
          
               a hand is visible on the other side, clawing at the glass.

               mattress, feebly looking up at karen.
          
                                   karen

               karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman,
