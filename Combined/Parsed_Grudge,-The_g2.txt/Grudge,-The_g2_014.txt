          14   int. the house - living room - dusk                           14
          
               karen has straightened up the room, and is vacuuming the
               floor. something under the couch catches in the vacuum
               intake, jamming it.
          
               she turns off the vacuum and feels underneath, pulling out a
               crumpled photo -- ripped into pieces, compressed in a ball.
