                int. nursing care center - day
                through the front doors, we see doug kiss karen again.   they
                finally separate, and doug walks off.

          then karen walks through the doors into a bright, atrium-like
          lobby area. she waves "hello" to the receptionist.

          leaning against a desk behind reception is karen's boss alex
          (40s, american). he's got a phone to his ear -- it's
          ringing. an answering machine picks up in japanese.
          
          alex mutters and hangs up.   then he notices --
          
                              alex
                    karen!
          
          she's started up a staircase in the center of the lobby.   she
          turns and comes back down, walking over to alex.
          
                              alex
                    are you free this afternoon?
          
                              karen
                    i just came by to pick up some
                    books i left here. i'm not
                    scheduled to work today --
          
                              alex
                    i know. but are you free?    do you
                    have class?
          
                              karen
                        (shaking her head:)
                    just a test to study for.   why?
          
          alex smiles, holding out a file.

                              alex
                    your wish has been granted.
          
          karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page -
          - a picture of an older woman (emma) is attached.
          
                              alex
                    it's yoko's case, but she didn't
                    show up for work this morning, and
                    i can't reach her at home. she
                    must be sick, or something. and
                    she has the damn house key.
          
          studying the file, karen squints.
          
                              karen
                    what's this phrase?
          
                              alex
                    "mild dementia with severe
                    lethargy." apparently she sleeps
                    through most of the day. her
                    daughter-in-law doesn't work, so
                    she'll probably be there.
          
          karen seems unsure.   it's a big step for her.
          
                              alex
                    you're the one who's been bugging
                    me about getting out there on your
                    own. besides, it's an english-only
                    house.
          
          one of alex's co-workers appears in the doorway, motioning to
          him. alex quickly hands karen a card:
          
                              alex
                    here's the address. use the wall
                    chart if you need help -- and don't
                    forget to bring a map.

                karen looks at the address -- a string of thirty numbers and
                japanese characters. she glances up at
          
                the wall chart: a color-coded diagram shows how the long
                address string is broken down into postal code, prefecture,
                city, ward, district, block, sub-block and house number.
          
                                    alex
                          don't worry karen, you're ready.
          
                karen nods.   but she's not quite as confident.

                people rush madly around karen as she studies a large map on
                the wall. it's the tokyo rail system -- daunting, at best.

                karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed
                in tightly by the people around her. the loud crying of a
                baby adds to her discomfort.
