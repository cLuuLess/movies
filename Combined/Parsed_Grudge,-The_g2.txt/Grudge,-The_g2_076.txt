                int. the house - entrance - day
                yoko steps inside. she instinctively slips off her shoes.
                she calls out, in decent english:
          
                                    yoko
                          hi, excuse me?
          
                there's a small envelope with yoko's name resting on a small
                table by the door. she takes it, opens it.

          the letter says, simply:   "out for a walk, back later."
