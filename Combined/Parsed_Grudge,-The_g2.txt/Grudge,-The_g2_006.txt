          6    ext. tokyo neighborhood - day                                   6
          
               karen exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street.
               she's still not sure if she's in the right place.
          
               but then her eyes fix on something. she begins to walk
               towards it, her gaze never leaving it --
          
          
          6a   ext. the house - day                                          6a
          
               -- it's the house.   cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead
               end of the street.   large by tokyo standards.
          
               she double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking
               around a bicycle leaning against the wall and following the
               stepping-stone path to the front door. she knocks. no
               answer. she tries again. nothing.
          
               then, an afterthought, she tries the handle.   it's unlocked.
