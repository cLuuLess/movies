               int. the house - front room - night
               matthew and his wife jennifer are in bed. he sleeps soundly,
               she doesn't. she's staring at the ceiling, listening to --
          
               -- sounds coming in through the open bedroom door. someone
               moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things.
          
               jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh.
