               karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it --
          
               -- but she pauses, realizing something.
          
               she reaches into her pocket, pulling out the photo she found.
               it only takes a second to verify --
          
               -- the boy in the photo is the one she found in the closet.
          
               karen lowers the photo, bewildered.    then she looks up,
               startled by --
          
               the boy. he's kneeling on the second floor landing above,
               watching her through the bars of the metal railing. creepy.
          
               karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.
          
                                   karen (in japanese)
                         hello there.
          
                                              really creepy.
               the boy just stares at her.
                                   karen (in japanese)
                         my name is karen. what's yours?
          
                                    the boy
                         toshio.
          
               before she can respond --
          
               ring! ring!   the phone in the next room startles her.
