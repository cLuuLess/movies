          62    int. susan's apartment - bedroom - night                        62
          
                susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the
                bedroom phone from the wall.
          
                then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on --
          
                the apartment door, next to the kitchen.    silence.
          
                susan's breathing slows. but she looks around the room,
                still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. her panic builds.
                but she's alone in the room, isn't she?
          
                as we move in on susan, the room starts to become quieter.
                the sound of traffic from outside, the humming refrigerator
                in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence.
          
                and susan notices, all right.    her breath, now suddenly loud,
                catches in her throat.
          
                a long moment of silence.   then --
          
                -- drip.   drip.
          
                it's coming from the kitchen sink.
          
                susan stares at it.   she finally stands, and --
