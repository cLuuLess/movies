               int. attic - day
               yoko's head appears. then her shoulders.     she looks around,
               but can't see a thing in the darkness.
          
               she's about to pull herself all the way up --
          
               -- when she hears the throaty croaking sound.
          
               coming from the darkness.
          
               yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat.
          
               another pov: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and
               rapidly racing forward towards yoko...
          
               on yoko:   something brushes her face.   long, black hair.
          
               there's a head, just inches from hers.    almost nose-to-nose.

               yoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   a long beat.
          
               then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a lighter.
          
               yoko raises it and flicks the wheel --
          
               -- we get a glimpse of a pale face, surrounded by long black
               hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the throaty sound suddenly
               increasing in pitch and volume --
          
               -- as the face moves forward --
          
                                                             cut to black.
