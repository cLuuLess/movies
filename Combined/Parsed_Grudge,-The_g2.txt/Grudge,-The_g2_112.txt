          130   int. the house - second floor hallway - night               130
          
                peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard.
          
                then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   thud.   thud.   thud.
          
                it's coming from toshio's room. and it's the same rhythmic
                thudding we've heard coming from this room before.
          
                peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads
                quickly down the hall (with karen following him):
          
                                     peter
                          toshio!   we have to --
          
                he stops short at the door, as he sees --
          
                -- takeo, toshio's father. eyes rolled back in his head,
                tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips.
          
                he's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by black hair that
                seems to cover its entire surface. kayako's hair.
          
                toshio, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings
                the body. takeo's feet thud rhythmically against the wall.
          
                                    karen
                          oh my god...
          
                peter doesn't stay to see any more.   he runs.
          
          131                                                               131
