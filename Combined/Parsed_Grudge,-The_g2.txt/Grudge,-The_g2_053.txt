                susan bursts out of the security room and runs through the
                empty lobby, towards the front doors.

                susan rushes out of the front doors and runs to the street.
                she frantically hails a cab and gets in.

                susan presses herself in the corner of the back seat, purse
                clutched tightly in her white knuckles.

               a shifting wash of colors flood the taxi: the neon lights of
               the surrounding buildings tower above, threatening to swallow
               her whole.
