               int. the house - later
               the house feels completely different: all the interior
               lights are on, a few police officers mill about, two emts
               wheel emma's body out the front door on a gurney.
          
               alex sits at the kitchen table, frazzled.   he turns to --
          
               -- karen. she's sitting in the living room, wrapped in a
               blanket, being attended to by a female nurse and speaking
               with nakagawa and igarashi, who is taking notes on a pad.
          
               karen says something and the detective looks over at alex.
               then he speaks to the nurse, who helps karen to her feet.
          
               nakagawa and igarashi enter the kitchen.    in perfect english:
          
                                   nakagawa
                         i am detective nakagawa. this is
                         detective igarashi, my assistant.
          
                                   alex
                         is karen okay?

                              nakagawa
                    she is very shaken. we would like
                    her to stay in the hospital
                    tonight, under evaluation.
          
          he hands alex a wedding picture of matthew and jennifer.
          
                              nakagawa
                    do you know these people?
          
                              alex
                    matthew williams, and his wife
                    jennifer. he's emma's son, the
                    woman karen came here to see.
          
                              nakagawa
                    when was the last time you saw him?
          
                              alex
                    i met them when they came to
                    register. it's standard procedure,
                    though the visits were arranged by
                    his employer. he works at --
          
                              nakagawa
                    we've spoken with his employer.   he
                    did not show up for work today.
          
          something about this gives alex pause. nakagawa speaks
          briefly to igarashi in japanese, then hands alex a card.
          
                              nakagawa
                    if you could please come by
                    tomorrow to make a statement, the
                    address is there, at the bottom --

                                 nakagawa
                    i'm sorry?
          
                               alex
                    karen was a substitute -- yoko is
                    the girl who is normally in charge
                    of emma. she's also been missing
                    from work.

          nakagawa and igarashi exchange a look.
          
                              alex
                    i think i saw her bike outside.

          interview alex.
