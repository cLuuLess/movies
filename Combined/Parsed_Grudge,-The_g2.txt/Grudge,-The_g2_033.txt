               int. the house - living room - night
               matthew turns on the lights. the room has reverted to its
               messy state, even worse than before.
          
               he looks down at a picture, formerly hanging on the wall, now
               lying on the ground. the glass is broken.
          
                                      matthew
                            what the hell? --
          
               he quickly goes to the back room. emma sits on the edge of
               her bed, dazed and staring. in the darkness.
          
                                       matthew
                            mom?   are you alright?
          
               no answer.    he kneels down next to her.
          
                                      matthew
                            where's jennifer, mom?
          
               still nothing.      he surveys the mess in the room.   angrily:
          
                                      matthew
                            did yoko come today, mom?
                            remember? the pretty girl?
          
               he gets to his feet, looking at the spilled soup in the
               living room, now hardened and crusty.
