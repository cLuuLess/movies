          48    int. office building - susan's floor - night               48
          
                it's after-hours in this office space: cubicles fill the
                center, surrounded by glass-windowed offices. the glittering
                lights of the tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view.
          
                one light still burns in an office towards the end --
          
                -- susan's office. she's working late. she wears a phone
                headset while she types lines of code into her computer.
          
                no one's answering.   a familiar answering machine picks up:
          
                                    matthew & jennifer (on machine)
                          "konnichiwa! matt and jennifer
                          aren't around, leave a message."
          
                                    susan (into phone)
                          hey, guys, it's susan. matt, are
                          you there? pick up... okay, well,
                          i'm leaving work now so you can try
                          my cell, or just call me at home
                          later.
          
                she pauses.   leans back, away from the keyboard.
          
                                    susan (into phone)
                          i just wanted to make sure mom is

                                        revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04        32.
          
                                    susan (into phone) (cont'd)
                          a bit weird, and -- i'm just a
                          little worried. listen, just give
                          me a call when you can, okay?
          
                she hangs up, taking the headset off.   concerned.
