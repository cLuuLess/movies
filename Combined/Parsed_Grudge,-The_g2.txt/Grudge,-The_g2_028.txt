               jennifer stands by a cart, looking pale under the stark
               fluorescent lighting. she also looks shell-shocked.
          
               her pov: before her is a wall of japanese products. barely
               a lick of english on any of the brightly-colored packages.
          
               jennifer is, in a word, clueless. she looks around for
               assistance -- but she's lost in a whirl of japanese faces.
          
               she tentatively reaches towards a bowl-shaped package.
               studies the japanese writing.
          
               stealing a glance around her, she quietly tears open a corner
               of the bowl. peeks inside. sniffs it. she smiles.
