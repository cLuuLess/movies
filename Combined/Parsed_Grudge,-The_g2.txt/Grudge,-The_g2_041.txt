          41   int. the house - entrance - night                            41
          
               twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, susan leans into the
               foyer, yelling upstairs:
          
                                   susan
                         i'll give you guys one minute to
                         finish whatever you're doing up
                         there and get your butts down here.
          
               as she heads back towards the kitchen, we crane up to see --
          
               matthew. he's walking down the second floor hall. he looks
               different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied.
          
               and he's dragging his dead wife's body.   by the hair.
          
               he pulls her inside the rear room -- the doorway looks more
               imposing, more ominous, than before. it's dark and
               malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried.
          
               we crane back down to see susan in the kitchen.   she's poured
               a glass of wine and sighs impatiently.
          
               she walks back down the hall into the foyer.
          
                                   susan
                         i mean it, guys.
          
               silence from upstairs.   shaking her head:
          
                                   susan
                         well, i warned you. prepare to be
                         emotionally scarred.
          
               she starts up the stairs and turns the first corner --
          
               -- matthew is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking
               harried. susan yelps.
          
                                    susan
                         matthew!   don't scare me like that!
          
               he's shaking slightly.   his eyes drift up to hers.
          
                                   susan
                         what's going on?   where's jennifer?

                              matthew
                    she went out. something came up.
          
                              susan
                    i hope she's not long.    i'm
                    absolutely starving.
          
          matthew looks back down at his feet.      susan misreads:
          
                              susan
                    i knew it. you guys forgot to go
                    shopping, didn't you?
          
          matthew abruptly stands.    looming over his sister.
          
                                 matthew
                    i'm sorry.     this is a bad time.
          
                              susan
                    are you okay? what's going on?
          
                              matthew
                    you should go.
          
          he moves forward, right into her. his momentum pushes susan
          back into the foyer. she holds onto his shirt:
          
                              susan
                    did something happen?    what's --
          
          matthew's hands suddenly tighten on her shoulders. his eyes
          grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely --
          
                              matthew
                    she doesn't love me... she never
                    loved me...
          
          susan watches as he repeats himself, over and over.      growing
          scared, she finally shakes him.
          
                              susan
                    what are you talking about?
          
          matthew slowly looks up.    malice on his face.
          
          he steps forward.   susan backs away.
          
                              susan
                    stop it, matthew.
          
                              matthew
                    leave me alone.

                                   susan
                         matthew, please --
          
                                    matthew
                             (yelling)
                         go away!!!
          
               susan fumbles with the front door. she gets it open and runs
               out just before matthew reaches her.
          
               on matthew: he stands there, head tilted down, for a moment.
               then he straightens. slowly closes the front door.
          
               matthew heads back upstairs. he reaches the second floor and
               opens the door to the rear bedroom.
          
               the room beyond is dark. but a dark figure is visible,
               standing in the far corner, facing matthew.
          
               he steps inside, and the door slowly swings shut behind him.
