          49    int. office building - 10th floor hall - night               49
          
                susan walks through the hallway. she hears a strange
                scraping sound -- it sounds as though something is being
                dragged.
          
                susan turns around, but the hallway looks normal. is it just
                her imagination?
          
                the sound starts again, coming closer. susan gets scared and
                opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her.
