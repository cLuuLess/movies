                 ext. the house - night
                 the flashing lights of police cars wash over the formerly
                 quiet neighborhood, illuminating --
          
                                          revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04    93.
          
          
          
                 karen. she's lying on a gurney, regaining consciousness.
                 japanese emts are speaking to her as she's being loaded into
                 the back of an ambulance.
          
                 karen's pov: the blurry forms of firemen rush by in slow
                 motion. everything is dizzy and incoherent...
          
                 karen tries to sit up -- but a young emt lays a gentle hand
                 on her arm, deftly sliding a needle under her skin. the
                 sedative takes hold almost immediately.
          
                 karen sinks back into the gurney, her eyes rolling back in
                 her head. she's fading fast.

                 the emts secure the gurney inside and close the doors. karen
                 fights the drug, but its grip is inevitable: she finally
                 gives up, sliding into a medicated sleep.
          
                 we slowly move in on her face, until it fills the screen.
          
                 then...
