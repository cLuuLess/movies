                karen enters quickly, going up to the front desk.
          
                officer #2, filling out paperwork, doesn't look up.
          
                                    karen (in japanese)
                          excuse me, i need to speak with
                          detective nakagawa.
          
                officer #2 looks up at her.   blankly.
          
                                    karen (in japanese)
                          it's an emergency.
          
                                    officer #2 (in japanese)
                          one moment.
          
                officer #2 walks to the end of the desk, where two more
                officers speak in hushed tones with detective aoki.
          
                officer #2 interrupts their conversation. and they all look
                over at karen. a beat. then detective aoki approaches.
          
                                    aoki (in english)
                          you are asking for detective
                          nakagawa?
          
                                    karen
                          yes, i have important information
                          for him about a case...
          
                she looks around. everyone is watching her. the mood is
                decidedly grim. she can tell something's up.
          
                                    aoki
                          detective nakagawa is not here
                          right now. can you tell me what
                          case this is regarding?
          
                there's something behind the detective's words.
          
                                    karen
                          his partner, detective igarashi?
                          can i speak with him?
          
                                          revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04      83.
          
          
          
                aoki exchanges a look with the officers.
          
                                    aoki
                          can you tell me your name, please?
          
                karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station.     she
                backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in.
          
                                    karen
                          they're dead, aren't they?
          
                karen turns and runs for the exit.
          
                                    aoki
                          miss, wait please --
          
                but she's long gone.
