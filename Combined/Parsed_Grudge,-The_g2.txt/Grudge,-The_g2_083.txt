               karen slowly wakes up in bed.    as her eyes clear, she sees --
          
               doug. he sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his
               back to her.
          
               he slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     he
               moves closer, and reaches out a hand.
          
                                      doug
                         it's okay.     i've got you.
          
               karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. but her eyes are
               glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted.
          
                                    doug
                         your boss told me what happened.
                         i'm sorry.
          
               she turns away, the memory bothering her.    doug takes her
               hand, massaging her fingers, worried.
          
                                   doug
                         i talked to your teachers. they
                         said you can take as much time as
                         you need. we could go to kyoto for
                         a weekend, see those temples you're
                         always talking about.
          
               karen tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it.
          
                                   karen
                         running away won't help.

                    doug
          there's nothing to run away from,
          kat. no one blames you for what
          happened.

                              karen
                    i'm not even sure what did happen.
          
                              doug
                    you went to help someone who was,
                    quite simply, beyond help.
          
                              karen
                    no, that's not what i mean...
          
          she trails off, trying to remember.   doug waits.
          
                              karen
                    that house. there was something...
          
          doug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from
          her face.
          
                              doug
                    don't beat yourself up searching
                    for a greater truth, kat. an old
                    woman passed away in her sleep.
                    it's sad, but that's all it is --
          
                              karen
                    is that how they said she died?
          
                              doug
                    i'm sorry this happened to you.
                    but maybe, in a way, it will help
                    you later. death is an unfortunate
                    but integral part of your future
                    career. there's no avoiding it.
                    maybe now you'll be more... ready
                    for it.
          
                              karen
                    i don't think i'll ever be ready
                    for something like that.
          
          she turns away. doug wraps an arm around her.   karen leans
          into him, and he strokes her hair.

          the moment is broken by a soft knock. detective nakagawa
          stands in the doorway, holding a thick file.
          
                               nakagawa
                    i'm sorry to disturb you, miss
                    davies. i was wondering if you
                    could answer some additional
                    questions?
          
          doug stands, intercepting nakagawa.   he sticks out a hand.
          
                                doug
                    i'm doug.    karen's boyfriend.
          
          nakagawa nods. fixes doug with a blank stare.   taking the
          hint, doug turns to karen.
          
                              doug
                    you up for this?
          
                              karen
                        (nodding:)
                    why don't you find out when i can
                    check out of here.

          reluctantly, doug kisses her brow, then exits. nakagawa
          pulls a chair up to the bed and sits, putting the file on a
          small table.
          
                              nakagawa
                    how are you feeling?
          
                               karen
                    okay.   tired.
          
                              nakagawa
                    you are an exchange student?
                        (karen nods:)
                    and you have been volunteering at
                    the health center for...?
          
                              karen
                    three months. i needed a social
                    welfare credit.
          
                              nakagawa
                    you said this was the first time
                    you'd been in that house?
          
                               karen
                    yes.
          
          she notices nakagawa isn't taking notes. he seems somewhat
          uncomfortable, as if he's building to something:
          
                              nakagawa
                    about the japanese boy you said you
                    saw there --
          
                              karen
                    did you find him?
          
                              nakagawa
                    no, not yet. you said the boy had
                    been taped into the closet?
          
                              karen
                    yes, that's right. he was...
                    holding a cat. a black cat.
                        (remembering:)
                    there was a book in the closet,
                    too. i think it was a journal.
          
                              nakagawa
                    did it belong to the boy?

                    karen
          i don't think so. i think it
          belonged to a woman.

          nakagawa looks up.   karen tries to explain:
          
                              karen
                    the writing. it looked feminine.

                              karen
                    i left it on the kitchen table.
          
          nakagawa frowns, scribbles a note.
          
                              nakagawa
                    i didn't see any book on the table.
                    perhaps someone moved it. did you
                    speak with the boy after you opened
                    the closet?
          
          she thinks, recalling:
          
                              karen
                    i asked him his name.   he said
                    `toshio'.
          
          nakagawa immediately tenses. a long beat. he can see how
          exhausted karen is. but something's troubling him:
          
                              nakagawa
                    one more question, please.
          
          he slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out the photo
          karen found, and taped together. he shows it to her.
          
                              nakagawa
                    we found this in the room where...
          
          karen looks at the picture.
          
                              karen
                    this is him. this is the boy.
          
                              nakagawa
                    are you certain?
          
                               karen
                    yes.   positive.
          
          nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands.
          
          and karen notices -- nakagawa's hands are shaking.
          
                              karen
                    detective nakagawa?
          
          he looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes.
          
                              karen
                    the whole time i was in that house,
                    i felt something was... wrong.

          from the expression on nakagawa's face, she's onto something.
          
                              karen
                    what happened there?
          
          nakagawa holds karen's gaze for a moment. even in her
          exhausted state, it's clear -- she's as frightened as he is.
          
                                         revisions (blue) -- 1/26/04      55.
          
          
          
                                   nakagawa
                         the bodies of the son and daughter-
                         in-law of the woman you were caring
                         for were found in the attic.
          
               karen just stares at him, stunned.
          
                                   nakagawa
                         it seems that the son killed his
                         wife, and then himself --
          
               there's a knock on the door. igarashi stands in the doorway.
               he speaks to nakagawa in japanese.
          
                                   nakagawa
                             (to karen)
                         please excuse me for a moment.
          
               nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and
               closes the door, but not all the way. karen watches and
               listens through the crack:
          
          90                                                                90
