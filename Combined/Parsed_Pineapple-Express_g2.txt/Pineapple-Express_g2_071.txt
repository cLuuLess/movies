          saul is led along a narrow tunnel. as they reach the end,       
          saul's eyes go wide. he enters the same massive metal           
          room that the government used in the 30s (at the                
          beginning of the movie)...only now it is rather worn
          down, and filled with hundreds of huge marijuana plants.
          
                                 saul                                     
                           (breath-taken)
                    el dorado.
          
          matheson urges saul through the dense forest of weed,           
          passing several of ted's thugs, the hum of the giant grow       
          lights filling the air.                                         
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                            
                    dude, look at all this weed.                          
          
                                 matheson                                 
                    shut the fuck up and keep moving.                     
          
          as matheson ushers saul through the foliage, saul notices       
          a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba            
          diving uniform (the one from the 1930s intro) hanging on        
          a wall.                                                         
          
                                 saul                                     
                    what the hell is that?                                
          
          they arrive at a door. matheson opens it and shoves saul        
          in, causing him to almost trip.                                 
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                            
                    ow.                                                   
          
          it is the same room private miller was in. matheson shuts       
          the door.                                                       
          
                                                                    92
