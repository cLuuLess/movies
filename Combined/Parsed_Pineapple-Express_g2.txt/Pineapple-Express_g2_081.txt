          int. barn - continuous
          
          the asians riddle the barn with bullets as they scream at      
          ted and his men in korean. the remaining thugs scamper         
          about, returning fire to the asians. ted and carol hide        
          behind a vehicle.                                              
          
                                   carol
                      on three.                                          
          
          ted nods.                                                      
          
                                   carol (cont'd)                        
                      one, two, three!                                   
          
          carol and ted pop up and unload their guns, hitting            
          several of their assailants. they watch in horror as           
          several more creep in through the hole the escalade made.      
          
                                   carol (cont'd)                        
                      you go down. i'll take care of this.               
          
          ted nods as carol steps out from behind her cover and          
          nails several assassins.                                       
          
          rat-a-tat-tat!!! carol is shot several times in the            
          chest! she lurches backwards, but does not fall. her           
          bullet proof vest has taken the bullets.                       
          
                                   carol (cont'd)                        
                      arggg!!!                                           
          
          carol continues firing and kills another attacker as ted       
          runs for the trap door.
