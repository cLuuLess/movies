          ext. alley behind a convienance store - moments later
          
          dale and the four kids all laugh hysterically as saul           
          marches around pretending to be godzilla, blasting weed
          smoke out of his nose and mouth as though it was fire.
          saul passes ack the joint. he takes a puff and starts
          coughing.
          
                                 dale
                           (very stoned)

                                 dale

                                 saul                                    
                    and we're all high, that's hilarious.                
          
          blake passes the joint to dale.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)

                    teach you some business. brass tacs -
                    this is the best weed you've ever smoked,
                    agreed?
          
          the kids all nod in agreement.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    so i'm gonna make this simple. how much
                    did you get between you?
          
                                 blake
                    a hundred and seventy eight.
          
          saul pulls out his impressive bag of weed. the kids gasp.
          
                                 saul
                    alright. you gimme all your money, you
                    can each take two handfuls of weed. that
                    treat ya right?
          
          the kids cheer as desmond takes two big handfuls.
          
                                 desmond
                    that's fucking awesome!
          
                                 saul
                    i know. keep it on the down low.
          
          they pay dale and take their weed. happy as hell, they
          run off, stuffing handfuls of weed into their pockets.
          
                                 ack
                           (to walt)
                    jason'll never believe this...until i
                    show him all this weed!
          
          dale holds the un-lit joint as saul takes the pot and the
          money.
          
                                 saul
                    and we, my good man, are officially scott
                    fuckin' free.
          
                                                                 74
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    there are still people trying to kill us.          
          
                                 saul
                    but at least now we can afford to run.
                    i'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks.
                    let's have us a little mardi-gras                  
                    fiesta.
          
          saul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around
          the corner. dale re-lights the remaining roach and           
          casually smokes. he blows some smoke rings, coughs a bit,
          stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed,
          but then-
          
          a cop car screeches to a halt right in front of dale! a
          female police liaison officer (who is not carol) gets out
          of the car. dale freezes in horror.
          
                                  police liaison
                    don't move!
          
          she walks towards dale. he seems prepared to run, but she
          places her hand on a can of pepper spray.
          
                                 police liaison (cont'd)
                    don't move! this stuff hurts. what's in
                    your hand?
          
                                 dale.
                    i'm sorry, ma'am. it's weed. i'll get rid
                    of it right away, i was just smoking
                    this. i...i thought it was
                    decriminalized. or something. for medical
                    purposes. i have epilepsy.
          
                                 police liaison
                    selling pot to my students isn't
                    "decriminalized." i'm the liaison officer
                    for this school and i just caught four
                    students showing off handfuls of
                    marijuana to their friends. they told me
                    they got it back here. put your hands up.
          
          she cuffs dale's hands behind him!
          
                                 dale
                    wait! i wasn't selling anything! all i
                    have is this little joint.
          
          
          police liaison takes the large joint out of dale's hand.
          
                                                                    75
          
          
          
                                 police liaison
                    you call this little?
          
          she throws it on the ground and smears it around with her
          foot.
          
                                 dale
                    i don't even have any money! how did i
                    sell weed if i don't have any money?!? i
                    was just smoking it. i swear. please.
          
          she pats him down, finding only his wallet. the police
          liaison sees he only has nine dollars. she pulls out his
          driver's license.
          
                                 police liaison
                    it's possible you're telling the truth.
                    i'm going to run a check and if it turns
                    out you don't have any priors and all
                    you've got is this small amount of
                    marijuana, i'll let you go with a fine.
                    take a seat.
          
          she walks towards her car as dale sits on the ground.
          
          angle on: saul
          
          saul merrily turns into the alley holding two red
          slurpees, when he jumps back in terror! he sees the cop         
          car up the alley. he ducks back behind the corner.
          
                                 saul
                    they got dale. oh fuck, oh fuck, oh
                    fuck...
          
          angle on: dale and the police liaison
          
          she looks at her car computer. the screen reads:
          
          dale denton: outstanding warrant - double hit and run.
          
          she looks back at dale and types into her computer.
