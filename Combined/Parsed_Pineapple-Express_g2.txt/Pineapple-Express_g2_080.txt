          int. underground storage room - continuous
          
          matheson moans and groans behind saul, who is staring at        
          dale's motionless body. horrified, he flips dale over...
          
          he's alive! the top of his left ear has been blown off!         
          
                                                                101
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    dale? you're alive!
          
                                 dale
                    what happened?
          
          saul analyzes dale's wound.
          
                                 saul
                    they got your ear.
          
          behind saul, matheson tries to stand up, but immediately     
          falls back down.
          
                                 dale
                           (difficulty hearing)
                    my what?
          
                                 saul
                    here. get up.
          
          saul helps dale stand up, freeing his hands. dale feels
          his ear.
          
                                 dale
                           (in pain)
                    aahhhh!!! my ear!!!
          
          dale turns to the injured matheson.                          
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    you killed my ear!!!
          
                                 matheson                              
                           (to saul)
                    you shot me..                                      
          
                                 saul
                           (to matheson)                               
                    well, you kneed my balls!
          
                                 dale
                    you shot him?
          
          dale notices saul is holding a gun.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    whoa.
          
          
          dale turns to matheson, who has stopped moving.              
          
                                                                  102
          
          
          
                                   dale (cont'd)
                      uh...stay there.
          
          they walk out the door and cautiously enter the forest of
          weed.
