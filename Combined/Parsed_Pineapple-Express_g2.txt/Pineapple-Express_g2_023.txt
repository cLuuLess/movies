          ext. forest - continuous
          
          the car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit
          woods. dale paces back and forth as saul walks over.
          
                                 dale
                    so what do we know? nothing. we may or
                    may not be followed because we don't even            
                    know if he found the roach or not. and,
                    we could just be completely crazy. but,
                    the question is this: even if he found
                    the roach, how could he know where you
                    were?
          
                                 saul
                           (thrilled)
                    he couldn't. cause i'm in the woods. it's
                    impossible! unless he's, like, hanging on
                    the bottom of the car or some shit, but i            
                    mean-
          
                                                                  30
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    no, what i mean is, if ted found the
                    roach and identified the weed, how could
                    he connect it to you?
          
                                 saul
                    there's no way. he could only find out
                    from red.
          
                                 dale
                    who is this red guy?                                
          
                                 saul
                    red's pretty much a middleman between ted
                    and guys like me. and we're mad fucking
                    tight. one time he convinced some girl he
                    knew to give me a hand-job within, like,
                    five minutes of me meeting her.
          
                                 dale
                    but let's say someone calls asking who he
                    sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say
                    you, because...why wouldn't he?
          
                                 saul
                    fuck that. that's bullshit. he would have
                    called me if that happened. a hand-job,
                    dale! imagine if i'd gotten you a hand              
                    job by now!                                         
          
                                 dale                                   
                    yeah, but saul, he's a fucking drug                 
                    dealer.                                             
          
                                 saul                                   
                    so? i'm a fuckin' drug dealer. what, you            
                    don't trust me then?                                
          
          saul stares at dale, who doesn't know how to respond.         
          
                                 dale                                   
                    um...i...call him. yeah, sure, call him.            
          
                                 saul                                   
                    thank you!                                          
          
          pleased, saul pats dale on the back.                          
          
                                 dale
                    you're right. you are. i'm just being               
                    paranoid. sorry, dude.                              
          
                                                                   31
          
          
          
          saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. we
          hear someone pick up.
          
                                 red (o.s.)
                           (through phone)
                    ow! hello?
          
                                 saul
                    yo, red. you okay man?
          
                                 red (o.s.)
                    saul! oh. i, uh...stubbed my toe.
          
          red sounds nervous.
          
                                 saul
                    dude, watch the toes. wear shoes in the
                    house. but red, i gotta get straight to
                    brass tacs, i need a favor.
          
                                 red (o.s.)
                    sure man, anything. i'm red.
          
                                 saul
                    you sure as fuck are, buddy. so, you know
                    how you gave me some of that pineapple
                    express stuff? don't tell anyone you gave
                    it to me.
          
                                 red (o.s.)
                    sure man, no problem. red swears it,
                    hombre.
          
                                 saul
                    so, can i come on over now?
          
          dale waves his hands in front of saul's face.
          
                                 dale
                           (louldy whispering)
                    no! we should do it tomorrow!
          
                                  saul
                           (covering phone, talks to
                            dale)

          saul looks around the dark forest.
          
                                    saul
                       yeah...okay. less scary shit happens in
                       the day.
          
          dale nods.
          
                                    saul (cont'd)
                              (into phone)

                                    red (o.s.)
                              (talking to someone else)
                       -i can hear him talking to someone, so-

                       yeah, right after i see my grandma.
          
                                    red (o.s.)

                       chillin' by noon.
          
          saul gives dale the thumbs up.
          
                                    red (o.s.)
                       well, cool brother. noon it is.
          
                                    saul

                       again sometime.
          
                                    red (o.s.)
                       for sure. we should definitely hit up the
                       casino.
          
          saul hangs up the cell.
          
                                    saul
