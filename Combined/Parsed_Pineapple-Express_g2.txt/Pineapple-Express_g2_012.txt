          dale hits a pipe. it is clear he strongly disagrees with        
          what the dj is saying.                                          
          
                                 talk radio dj                            
                    ...stay in your own country. five simple              
                    words. and stay the hell out of mine! i'm             
                    not a racist, per se, but i'm not some                
                    hippy tree humper.                                    
          
          we see his ear piece and hear that he is on hold.               
          
                                 dale
