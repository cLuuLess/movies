          int. saul's apartment - moments later
          
          the rough looking guys, budlofsky and matheson, kick in        
          saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. matheson       
          spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray.
          
                                  matheson                               
                    look.
          
          budlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial.              
          
                                 budlofsky                               
                    ted? he's gone, but he was just here. i              
                    think he knew we were coming.
