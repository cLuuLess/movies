          int. angie's apartment - continuous                             
          
                                 angie                                    
                    it's dale! you came.                                  
          
          dale freezes in horror: angie's parents (shannon and            
          robert) are pleasantly eating at the dining room table.         
          
                                 shannon                                  
                    hi, dale. nice to meet you, sit down and              
                    have some couscous. can i get you a                   
                    drink?                                                
          
          robert sees that dale is dirty, dishevelled, bruised and        
          battered.                                                       
          
                                                                  59
          
          
          
                                 robert                                 
                    what the hell happened to you?                      
          
                                  angie                                 
                    dale?   what happened to you?                       
          
          robert and shannon exchange worried looks.                    
          
                                 dale                                   
                    nothing, i was in the woods and...                  
                           (turns to angie's parents)                   
                    ...hi, i'm dale. uh...it's nice to

                                 shannon                                
                           (not amused)                                 
                    shannon.                                            
          
                                 dale                                   
                    yes! shannon. i've heard a lot about both           
                    of you.                                             
          
          dale walks to robert and extends his dirty, bloody hand.      
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                          
                    very nice things.                                   
          
          robert smugly declines dale's hand shake.                     
          
                                 angie                                  
                    you were in the woods?                              
          
                                 dale                                   
                           (at a loss for words)                        
                    alright, now, here's what's happened -              
                    i've been thrust into a kind of,

                    just start to evacuate...                           
          
          dale starts gathering all their jackets and shoes.            
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                          
                    ...that'd be really, really good right

                    is this a joke?

                    i think it is a joke.                                 
          
                                 dale                                     
                           (deep breath)                                  
                    listen. there are people after us and

                                 robert                                   
                    he's serious?                                         
          
                                 dale

                    to get the "f" out of here!                           
          
          the anderson's stare at him dumbfounded. robert gets up         
          and stands tall.                                                
          
                                 robert

                    okay, mr. anderson, look, here's the deal             
                    - i saw a crooked cop kill a guy while i              
                    was working...this morning. the cop shot              
                    the guy then saw my car drive off, and i              
                    think they might have seen my license                 
                    plate and, so, i ditched my car...in the              
                    woods, so...                                          
          
          they stare at dale as though he were crazy.
