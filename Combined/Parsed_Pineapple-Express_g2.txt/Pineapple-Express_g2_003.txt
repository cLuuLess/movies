          int. observation lab - continuous
          
          the three men enter a large room divided by a one-way
          mirror.
          
          on their side, numerous scientists, utilizing several
          archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject
          on the other side of the mirror.
          
          the subject: private miller (22, naive and dutiful) sits
          at a small table with a microphone on it. miller raises
          his hand, revealing a smoldering joint.
          
                                                                    2
          
          
          he takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts
          into a coughing fit.
          
          the scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
          devices blink manically. general brat and agent black
          suit exchange a concerned look. the general lights a
          cigarette as the scientist steps up to a small microphone
          in the corner.
          
                                 scientist
                           (into microphone)
                    private miller, we are now going to ask
                    you several questions. how do you feel?
          
          his voice booms through large speakers on miller's side
          of the room. miller leans towards the microphone.
          
                                  private miller
                    uh, i feel a little queer sir. but...
                    it's good. good queer.
                           (beat)
                    sir. good queer, sir.
          
          the scientists scribble madly. one of them mumbles into
          general brat's ear.
          
                                 private miller (cont'd)
                    but...uh...even though i feel queer, sir,
                    i should mention that i'm also feeling
                    quite gay...so, a little queer, but
                    mostly gay.
          
                                 scientist
                    private miller. when you think of your
                    superiors, what emotions do you feel?
          
                                 private miller
                           (holding out the joint)
                    this went out...sir.
          
                                 scientist
                    we will send someone in. now answer the
                    question.
          
          a door opens beside private miller and an agent steps out
          wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old
          fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door
          that he came from. he slowly walks toward the private,
          who looks at him in shock.
          
                                 scientist (cont'd) (o.s)
                           (through speakers)
                    private miller? answer the question.
          
                                                                     3
          
          
          
                                 private miller
                    oh...um...what was the question again?
          
          the agent in the strange suit reaches the private and
          holds a lighter up to the joint.
          
                                 scientist (o.s.)
                           (through speakers)
                    what are your emotions towards your
                    superiors?
          
          miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. the
          agent exits the room.
          
                                  private miller
                     cough   cough  fucking shit.
                           (beat)
                    well, now that i think of it, it's
                    strange that they are called my
                    `superiors'. does that make me their
                    `inferior'? i mean, that's pretty fucked
                    up.
          
          general brat scowls.
          
                                 general brat
                           (curtly to the scientists)
                    i've seen enough. shut it down. bury the
                    hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.
                    this never happened.
          
          instantly, the scientists start packing up their
          equipment. staring at miller, general brat grabs a red
          phone and dials. two agents in the scuba-like suits
          emerge from behind miller and start aggressively dragging
          him away.
          
                                 private miller
                           (freaking out)
                    hey! what the...what are you guys doing!              
                    let go of me!
                           (desperately looking at the
                            mirror)
                    sir!!! sir!!! help me!!!
          
                                  general
                           (into phone)
                    this is general brat. we've reached a
                    final conclusion on item 9.
                           (beat)
                    illegal.
          
          he hangs up the phone.
          
                                                                     4
          
          
          
          cut to black.
