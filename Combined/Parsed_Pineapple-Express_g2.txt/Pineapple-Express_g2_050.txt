          ext. park - night
          
          dale and saul are sitting in the branches of a tree. fast      
          food wrappers lie scattered. saul is rolling a joint.
          
                                 saul
                    victory joint complete. here ya go.
          
          saul passes it to dale, who lights it. dale takes another
          puff and starts to seriously relax. a smile creeps across
          his face as he passes the joint to saul.
          
                                 dale
                    "tell us what you know!" how fuckin'
                    balls was that?
          
          saul takes a puff.
          
                                 saul
                    like, really balls.
          
                                 dale
                    and i think i fought pretty well, don't
                    you? you know, for my first time. we were
                    like tango and cash, man.
          
                                   saul
                    or scarface!
          
                                 dale
                    boom! knocked the door right off it's
                    hinges!
          
          saul passes the joint to dale.
          
                                 saul
                    and you probably saved angie, which is
                    fucking pimp.
          
                                                                 69
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    i probably couldn't have done it without
                    you. thanks, man. it is fucking pimp.
          
                                 saul
                    we're in this together, right? so, ya
                    know.
          
          saul passes the joint to dale.
          
                                  dale
                    thanks, man.
                           (beat)
                    you know, my last dealer was a total
                    dick. you're by far the coolest dealer
                    i've ever had.
          
                                 saul
                           (sincerely)
                    wow. thanks, man. i seriously appreciate
                    that.
          
                                 dale
                    yeah...like, the time before last time, i          
                    totally had weed. i just kind of wanted            
                    to chill with you.                                 
          
                                 saul
                           (over-joyed)
                    really? that's awesome, man. that means a          
                    lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes           
                    come in to buy and pretend to be all
                    buddy-buddy with me, but in my head i'm
                    always, like, "you don't like me, you
                    like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" you
                    know? and just so you know, i totally              
                    could have lit that cross-joint on my
                    own. i'd just have to use candles, but,
                    like, i've never smoked one of those with
                    anyone before.                                     
          
          dale passes saul the joint.                                  
          
                                 dale
                    so, do you think we should leave town? we          
                    could just get on a bus and go, right?
          
                                 saul
                    we only have, like, fifty bucks. i don't
                    think that could even pay for one ticket.
          
          saul rubs the roach out in the dirt.
          
                                                                 70
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    what about your sack?
          
          saul rubs his balls again.
          
                                 saul
                    oh man. it's still fucking killing me.
          
                                 dale
                           (laughing)
                    no dude, your sack of weed. can't we sell
                    some?
          
                                 saul
                    of course. that's my bread and butter. we
                    just have to go to a highschool. it's the
                    easiest market. chester a. arthur is               
                    like, a block a way.                               
          
                                 dale
                    no way, man. i'm not going to sell to              
                    kids.                                              
          
                                 saul                                  
                    why? they're gonna get it from somewhere.          
                    i mean, we got it from guys like us.               
          
                                 dale                                  
                    well, then not kids at that school.                
                                                                       
          
                                 saul                                  
                    well, there's a bunch of private ones              
                    nearby, but they're into way crazier shit          
                    than weed-                                         
          
                                 dale                                  
                    i can't do it, man. i'm not going to a             
                    high school is there anywhere else we              
                    could go?                                          
          
                                 saul
                           (thinks, then-)
                    we could go to crackhead park.
          
                                   dale
                    what's that?
          
                                 saul
                    it's a park. really close, actually. full          
                    of crackheads. they smoke weed too,
                    though.                                            
          
                                                                    71
