          int. dale's car - the next day
          
          dale slowly wakes up. he stretches, and then shakes saul.
          
                                 dale
                    saul. saul. get up. wake up.
          
          saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is.
          
                                 saul
                    fuck me.
          
                                 dale
                    what's the time?
          
                                 saul
                           (groggy)
                    it's too early.
          
          saul brings his wrist up close to his eyes.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    it's...
          
          saul stares at his watch, confused.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    this can't be right.
          
                                 dale
                    what does it say?
          
                                 saul
                    it says, uh...
          
          saul looks outside towards the sun.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    it couldn't be three in the morning,
                    could it?
          
                                 dale
                    it's three o'clock!?! we were supposed to
                    be there at noon!
          
                                  saul
                           (excited)
                    wait! my grandma's clocks! it's daylight
                    savings!
                           (beat)
                    fuck! no! they go forwards an hour!
                    dammit-
          
                                                                  41
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    it's four o'fucking clock?!
          
                                 saul
                    -i didn't go to my grandma's! fuck! and
                    we've gotta call red.
          
                                  dale
                            (angry)
                    how?
          
          dale digs in his pockets for the keys.
          
                                 saul
                    we'll find a pay pho...fuck! his number
                    was in my phone!
          
          dale notices the keys are in the ignition.
          
                                 dale
                    you remember where he lives, right?
          
                                 saul
                    yes, i remember. what the hell is that
                    supposed to mean? are you insinuating i'm
                    forgetful? that's right, i know the word
                    insinuating.
          
                                 dale
                    let's just get out of here.
          
          he turns the keys. nothing. he tries again. nothing.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    what the fuck? come on.
          
          he tries twice more, but nothing happens.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                           (pissed off)
                    i think the battery's dead.
          
                                 saul
                    are you fucking serious?
          
          he tries again.
          
                                  dale
                    it's dead.
          
                                  saul
                    it's dead?                                          
          
                                                                  42
          
          
          
          dale shoots saul an angry look.                               
          
                                  saul (cont'd)                         
                     what the fuck happened? how did this
                     happen?
          
                                  dale
                     how? we fell asleep!                               
          
                                  saul                                  
                     yeah. with your stupid talk radio. no              
                     surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put           
                     people to sleep.                                   
          
          frustrated, dale tries to gather his thoughts.
          
                                  dale
                     we gotta...let's just...we'll walk. we'll          
                     walk to a road and hitchhike to red's.
          
                                 saul
                     for real?
          
          dale opens his door and hops out.
          
                                  dale
                     yeah, "for real". we'll be late, but               
                     we'll get there. then we can fix this
                     insane situation.
          
          montage:                                                      
          
          - dale and saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road,     
          each smoking their own joint.                                 
          
          - saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf.
          dale is grossed out. saul pokes the caterpillar and then
          blows weed smoke onto it.
          
                                  dale (cont'd)                         
                     stop fucking around, man. come on. leave           
                     that thing alone.                                  
          
          - they emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride.
          
          - dale notices saul has his thumb sticking out of his         
          zipper.
          
                                  saul
                     it's like, my thumb is my cock!
          
          dale doesn't laugh.                                           
          
                                                                    43
          
          
          
          - bored and tired, they wait.   saul lights a joint. dale       
          notices. saul shifts his body   away from dale. just then,      
          an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. saul snubs out the
          freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket.
