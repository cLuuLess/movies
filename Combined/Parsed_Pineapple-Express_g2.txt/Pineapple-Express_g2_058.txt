          ext. quiet residential street - moments later
          
          the stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and saul hops out.
          
                                 saul
                    run!
          
          he starts running up the block at top speed.
          
          dale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts
          thrashing and screaming.
          
                                 dale
                    saul! saul! i'm locked in!
          
          dale continues to scream as saul obliviously bolts to the
          end of the block and just keeps going.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    you dumb fucking fuck!!! help me!!!
          
          dale sits in the car, helpless. he has a look of utter
          disbelief on his face. after a moment of silence he
          starts wildly kicking the door window. he soon gives up.
          
          just then, dale notices saul, over a block away, running
          back towards the stolen car. saul soon arrives,
          completely out of breath, and opens the door.
          
                                 saul
                    so... huff ... huff ...fuckin'
                    sorry... huff ...forgot...
          
          dale flops out of the car and onto the grass. saul tries
          to help him to his feet, but dale pulls away.
          
                                 dale
                    don't touch me, you asshole!
          
          dale wiggles to his feet runs for it. saul follows.
