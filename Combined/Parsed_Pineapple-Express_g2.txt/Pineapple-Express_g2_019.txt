          int. saul's apartment - moments later
          
          saul is laying on his couch watching saved by the bell,
          laughing so hard that he's crying.
          
                                 saul
                    ha! ha! ha! screech.                                  
          
          suddenly, the buzzer sounds repeatedly.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                           (mumbles)
                    fucking hell.
          
          he grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    hello?
          
          he presses listen.
          
                                 dale (o.c.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...me in! let me in! let me in!    let me
                    in! it's dale! let m--
          
          saul casually presses the talk button.
          
                                 saul
                           (annoyingly casual)
                    denton? dale denton?
          
          he smiles to himself, then presses listen.
          
                                 dale (o.c.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...the love of shit, let me in! pleeea-
          
          annoyed, saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door.
          
                                                                   22
          
          
          
                                 saul
                           (to himself)
                    ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you
                    can't handle it.
          
          a moment later, dale, completely freaking out, bursts
          through the door and slams it shut.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                           (startled)
                    dude, whoa. what the fuck are-
          
                                 dale
                    he fucking killed him, man!
          
                                 saul
                    be quiet, man, i got neighbors-
          
                                 dale
                           (quietly)
                    he killed him!
          
                                  saul
                           (loud)
                    somebody killed somebody?!?
          
                                 dale
                    yeah, man! i can't believe it. a cop! a
                    lady, and a guy.
          
                                 saul
                    somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
          
                                 dale
                    no! a guy!
          
                                 saul
                    a cop killed a guy?
          
                                 dale
                    no! a cop and a guy killed   another guy!
                    the lady and the guy...no,   a fucking
                    woman, a police woman, and   an old guy,
                    shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking
                    window at ted's house!
          
                                 saul
                    was the guy ted?
          
                                 dale
                    which guy?
          
                                                                 23
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    i don't know, the old guy who shot the
                    guy?
          
                                 dale
                    i don't fucking know. he was this big,
                    old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he
                    fucking took him, and he shot him! right
                    there in the fucking window! bam!
          
                                 saul
                    i heard ted's got grey hair!
          
                                 dale
                    and they saw me! they saw me see them
                    shoot the guy!
          
          saul jumps to his feet.
          
                                 saul
                    what!?! they saw you?!? why the fuck did
                    you come here? did they follow you?!?
          
          saul dashes to the window and peeks out.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    did they follow you here!?!
          
                                 dale
                    no! i panicked. i was having a coughing
                    fit, i crashed, i crashed into a car.
                    fuck, two cars. they must've heard at
                    least. they knew someone was there.
          
                                 saul
                    but they don't know it's you?
          
                                 dale
                    no. i don't think so. no.
          
                                 saul
                    so...they're not coming here?
          
          dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. saul shrugs,
          sits back down, then picks up his joint and re-lites it.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    cool. so, what's your game-plan? you
                    gonna call the cops? cause if you do, i'd
                    appreciate it if you left my shit out of
                    this shit.
          
                                                                   24
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    i'm not calling the cops - one of them
                    was a cop. they could all be cops!                   
          
                                 saul
                    did you see any blood? was it sick?
          
                                 dale
                    yeah. i saw some blood.
          
                                 saul
                    i wonder who the guy he shot was?
          
                                 dale
                    i don't know, who do drug dealers kill?
                    it was probably another drug dealer. he
                    was asian. are there asian drug dealers.
          
                                  saul
                    hell yeah, man. the koreans teamed up
                    with, like, the vietnamese or some shit.
                    they're crazy mother fuckers. number two
                    in town.
                           (beat)
                    heh. ted's cappin' the competition. yo,
                    you want some of this?
          
          saul passes dale the joint. dale takes the joint and           
          frantically smokes as he paces.                                
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                           
                    so, like, exactly what was the sequence
                    of happenings?
          
                                 dale                                    
                    i'm sitting across from ted's smoking a
                    massive joint of that weed you sold me-
          
                                 saul
                    oh, the pineapple express. it's so rare
                    it's almost a shame to smoke it, like
                    killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.              
          
                                 dale
                    when i threw it...out...the window...                
          
          dale stops pacing and stares at saul. he then looks down       
          at the joint of pineapple weed. saul notices wheels
          turning in dale's head.
          
                                 saul
                    what?
          
                                                                  25
          
          
          
          dale continues staring at the joint.
          
                                 dale
                    this weed is actually that rare?
          
                                 saul
                           (proudly)
                    yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
          
                                 dale
                    so, you are actually the only guy in town
                    with this weed?
          
                                 saul
                    fuckin' rights, i am. red told me he was
                    giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
          
                                 dale
                    and am i the only guy you gave it to?
          
                                 saul
                    yeah. so, we're the only guys.
          
                                 dale
                    but, like, another dealer, couldn't
                    identify it, the pineapple weed? like, if
                    they found a roach of it, right?
          
          saul thinks for a moment.
          
                                 saul
                    i could. why?
          
                                 dale
                           (panicking)
                    we should go, we shouldn't be here! we
                    should go!
          
                                 saul
                    no...seriously, why?
          
                                 dale
                    i left a roach of this weed in front of
                    ted's house!
          
                                 saul
                    so what? i leave roaches all over fucking
                    town.
          
                                                                    26
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    no, listen - they could find the roach
                    and say, "this is pineapple weed, saul's
                    the only guy in town who has pineapple
                    weed, therefore he must have witnessed
                    the murder or know who did - let's go
                    kill him."
          
          finally, saul understands.
          
                                 saul
                    mother of fuck!
          
          he springs to his feet and bolts for the door.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    let's go!
          
          dale grabs saul and stops him.
          
                                 dale
                    wait!
          
                                 saul
                    why!?! let go of me! let's get the fuck
                    out of here!
          
                                 dale
                    saul, wait! grab anything we might need,
                    like your weed and money and stuff.                   
          
          saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack.
          they run for the door.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    are you sure you're not forgetting
                    anything?
          
                                 saul
                    yes! come on!
