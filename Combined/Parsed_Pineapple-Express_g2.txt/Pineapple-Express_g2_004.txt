          int. dale's car - continuous                                    
          
          dale denton (late 20s, out of shape, slightly unkempt)
          looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits       
          in his cluttered and worn old lady car. he smokes a joint       
          while listening to talk radio.

                    well, let's look at the facts.                        
                    financially, coins are better because                 
                    they're cheaper, and environmentally,                 
                    forget-about-it, coins win hands down.                
                    for those just joining us, we're with                 
                    caller dale denton discussing if america              
                    should lose the paper dollar bill.                    
          
          we see that dale has a wireless ear piece in.                   
          
                                 dale                                     
                    of course not! who wants a pocket full of             
                    coins? seriously. weighs down your pants,             
                    clangs around. with all this unnecessary              
                    new security everywhere, we'll be setting             
                    off alarms left and right!                            
          
                                 talk radio dj                            
                    we certainly do, mr. denton. crude, but               
                    to the point. next caller!                            
          
          dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice        
          house.
