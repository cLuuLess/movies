          int. underground facility - continuous
          
          the air thick with weed smoke, dale slowly rises to his
          feet. he sees ted slumped against the wall, dead,
          partially aflame. dale walks over to ted's body and takes      
          the gun out of his hand.                                       
          
                                 dale
                    sorry, ted...                                        
          
          he pulls a small blue envelope out of his pocket and
          drops it on ted.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    ...but you've been served.
          
                                                                   110
          
          
          
          dale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire. the       
          air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath. dale          
          looks around desperately. he spots the fire extinguisher.       
          he looks at the flames. he takes a deep breath, picks up        
          the fire extinguisher, hurls it with all his might at the       
          fire, and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at          
          it!                                                             
          
          blam! blam! blam! he hits the extinguisher and it               
          explodes, blasting out the fire in the hallway towards          
          the barn. dale runs like hell.                                  
          
          as he bolts down the hallway, the flames rush back in and       
          chase after him.
