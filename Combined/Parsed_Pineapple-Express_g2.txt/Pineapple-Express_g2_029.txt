          int. red's apartment - continuous
          
          red is beating the shit out of saul.
          
                                                                    48
          
          
          
                                 saul                                     
                    why, man!?! why!                                      
          
                                   red                                    
                    i'm sorry!!!                                          
          
          saul manages to stand up when red boots him in the balls!
          he shrieks and stumbles backwards. dale dashes into the
          room and leaps onto red's back. red wobbles forward, then       
          starts running backwards. he trips on his coffee table
          and crashes dale through it, landing on top of him. red         
          gets up, sprints into the bathroom and locks the door.
          with great effort, dale and saul manage to get up.
          
                                 dale                                     
                    he's going for the phone! bathroom!
