          int. underground facility - continuous
          
          ted and dale grapple violently on the ground. his gut          
          jiggles as he lunges forwards, punching dale in the
          throat! dale falls to his knees, gasping for air. ted
          kicks him in the head and picks up his gun.
          
          angle on: an asian assassin                                    
          
          barely alive, the asian assassin with the briefcase drags      
          himself down the corridor and enters the grow room. he         
          opens the briefcase and we see that it is a bomb. the          
          assassin inserts a key.                                        
          
          ted stands over dale, aims the gun to his head, and-
          
          ka-boom!!! the briefcase explodes!!!. flames sweep over        
          the room as dale rolls for cover. ted gets blasted back.
