          saul is sitting against the wall with his hands bound and    
          a look of complete defeat. suddenly, the door opens and      
          dale is tossed in by budlofsky.                              
          
                                 saul

                    out, you shitty bastard? that what
                    happened?
          
                                 dale
                    no! i came here to save you!                       
          
                                 saul
                    to save me? ha! that's rich! you're                
                    caught, too. and now i have to die with            
                    some asshole.                                      
          
                                 dale

                    tell ya what, dale. you actually save me           
                    and i'll consider forgiving you for this

                                 dale                                  
                    good. `cause i will.                               
          
                                                                    97
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    oh really? what, you forget to tell me
                    you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you
                    got some kind of secret blowtorch
                    strapped to your dick? we're not gonna
                    escape, dale, we're losers, and sinners,
                    and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!
          
                                 dale
                    we're not losers! we did that car chase.
                    that was all you, man! you got away from
                    the cops. i've watched, like, nine
                    billion hours of worlds wildest police
                    chases and i've never seen a guy get
                    away. not once! but you did it. you did
                    the impossible.
          
          suddenly, they both hear someone coming. the door opens.
          matheson pokes his head, and gun, in.                           
          
                                 matheson                                 
                    we can hear you out there, and it's
                    annoying. shut the fuck up.
          
          he looks dale and saul up and down, then shuts the door.
          dale sits down and thinks, but is disturbed by his belt
          buckle, which is digging into his gut.
          
                                 dale                                     
                           (whispering)
                    perfect! now rub your wrists against my
                    belt! my belt buckle'll cut the tape. do
                    it! this is it!
          
          saul is hesitant, but awkwardly gets in position anyway.
          
                                   dale (cont'd)
                             (whispering)
                    hurry!
          
          in an unavoidably sexual-looking motion, saul begins to
          gyrate against dale's belt buckle.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                           (hushed)
                    yes! yes! you know what this is called,               
                    saul? this is called saving you.
