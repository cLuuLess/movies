          int. saul's apartment hallway - moments later
          
          saul and dale run to the elevator and frantically press
          the button, terrified for their lives.
          
                                 saul
                    fuck! i forgot something!
          
          saul runs back to his apartment, leaving dale alone and
          frightened. saul bursts back out of his apartment holding
          his cell.
          
                                                                    27
          
          
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    dude, i was so scared going back, i
                    thought there was gonna be guys there,
                    and then you'd be gone, and there was
                    this music in my head-
          
                                 dale
                    we'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.
          
          they scramble towards the distant stairwell. almost at
          the door, they hear the ding of the elevator arriving.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    go back! go back!
          
          they dash back to the elevator. dale shoves his arm
          between the doors and they hop in. saul rapidly presses
          the lobby button as the doors shut. they're both on the
          verge of hyperventilating.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    okay, man. we gotta try to relax.
          
                                 saul
                    why?!?
          
                                 dale
                    we don't want to draw attention.
          
                                 saul
                           (freaking out)
                    whose attention!?! you think they could
                    be down there? in the lobby? right now!?!
          
                                 dale
                    i don't know! who knows? just try to be
                    cool.
          
           ding  the elevator suddenly stops on the second floor.
          
                 dale (cont'd)                     saul
          oh my god!!!                  ahhh!!!
          
          the doors open! there's no one there. the doors close.
          
                                 saul
                    what the fuck was that?
          
                                 dale
                    that was bad - calm! calm! calm!
          
          the elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they
          step out, bumping into two rough looking guys.                  
          
                                                                   28
          
          
          
                                  dale (cont'd)
                    oh. pardon.
          
          dale and saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the
          elevator.
