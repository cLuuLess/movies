          int. red's apartment - continuous
          
          saul chases red and tackles him into a wall. dale follows
          seconds later, and notices red's large glass bong. he
          looks back to see saul getting pummelled.
          
                                  saul                                   
                    dale! help!                                          
          
          dale grabs the bong and swings around - crash!!! it
          shatters on the back of red's head.
          
          red falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his
          head. dale and saul stand over him, out of breath,
          bruised and battered.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                           
                    red, you motherfucker.
          
          dale, lost in thought, starts to seriously freak out.
          
                                 dale
                    it's happening! it's actually happening!
                    he knows my name! red knows my name!
          
                                 saul
                    we should beat it out of his sellout
                    brains. you're a shitty friend, red! fuck
                    the casino! go alone!
          
                                 dale
                    this is fucked, what do we do now, he
                    knows my name!?!
          
                                 saul
                    he knows my name too!
          
                                 dale
                    well what do we do? he's gonna tell them!
          
                                 saul
                    we're not gonna have to kill him, are we?
                    i don't think i could do that.
          
          dale stares at the almost motionless red.
          
                                                                  50
          
          
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    maybe we could talk him into killing
                    himself, or, like, make him promise not
                    to tell.
          
                                 dale
                    well, we have to find out what he knows.
          
                                 red
                           (in great pain)
                    i don't know anything...you broke my
                    bong...
          
          dale, trying to act tough, grabs red by the collar.
          
                                 dale
                    tell us everything. now!
          
          red looks to saul for sympathy.
          
                                 saul
                    don't look at me, you sellout bastard.
                    now start talking!
          
                                 red
                    i can't...i don't know anything.
          
          dale pulls saul aside.
          
                                 saul
                    what do we do? he's not gonna talk.
          
                                 dale
                    i think we beat it out of him.
          
                                   saul
                    for real?
          
                                 dale
                    okay. red. here's the deal: if you don't
                    tell us everything, we're going to beat
                    you up.
          
                                 red
                    don't beat me up! saul, dude, i'm red!
          
                                 saul                                   
                    you were red. now you're no one to me.              
          
                                 dale
                    you've got five seconds, okay? ready?
                    five, four-
          
                                                                 51
          
          
          
          dale raises his fist.
          
                                 red
                    please don't.
          
                                 dale
                    three, two...one!
          
          red cringes as dale softly "punches" his gut. it doesn't
          hurt him.
          
                                 red
                    that didn't hurt.
          
                                 saul
                    you didn't even hurt him! hit him hard,
                    man. like, fucking hit him!
          
          dale takes a deep breathe and raises his fist.
          
                                 red
                    wait! i...i...                                     
          
          dale grabs a potted plant.                                   
          
                                  red (cont'd)                         
                    no!                                                
          
          dale swings the plant back to strike red. the pot flies      
          off the plant and dale smashes the dirt covered roots of     
          the plant against red's face.                                
          
                                 red (cont'd)                          
                    ow! fuck, man! stop it.                            
                    listen...two...two guys came here,

                                 dale
                    who were they?
          
          dale raises his fist.
          
                                 red
                    they work for ted. budlofsky and                   
                    matheson. fuckin' crazy weird guys. they           
                    were here all day, but you guys didn't
                    show. they said they'd kill me if i
                    didn't bring you to them, they said i'd-
          
                                                                   52
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    how many cops does he have in his...uh,
                    payroll, or whatever?
          
                                 red
                    i know there's this lady cop. he could
                    have more, i don't know. he's got pretty
                    crazy connections. he's also got a cool-             
                    ass hideout. it's crazy man.                         
          
          dale and saul exchange very worried looks.
          
                                  red (cont'd)
                    listen, i-
          
          dale swings the plant upwards, prepared to strike red          
          again.                                                         
          
                                 dale
                    who's his competition?
          
                                  red
                    the asians!
          
                                 dale
                    asians? which asians? indians are
                    technically asian.
          
                                 red
                    the...the koreans, i think. everyone just
                    calls them the asians.
          
          dale and saul exchange an even more worried look.
          
                                  saul
                    what else?
          
                                 red
                    i swear to god that's all i know...i                 
                    swear...
          
                                 dale
                    alright. we should...tie him up and...and
                    get the fuck out of here.
          
                                 saul
                    i made a gravity bong here once. i know
                    where his duct tape is.
          
          saul runs off. dale puts on saul's backpack and looks at
          the battered red moaning on the floor.
          
                                                                    53
          
          
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    come on, let's tape this piece of shit
                    up.
          
          dale pulls red's hands behind his back. saul is picking
          at the tape.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    i can't find the edge.
          
                                 dale
                    what?
          
                                 saul
                    i can't find the, oh...wait...
          
          saul rips open the duct tape. he quickly binds red's            
          hands and feet. suddenly, there's a knock at the door.          
          they stop, silent. knock. knock. knock. red starts              
          thrashing and trying to scream.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                           (whispering)                                   
                    shit. they're actually here to kill him.
          
                                 dale
                           (whispering)

          red frantically tries to wriggle out of his bonds while      
          saul leads dale out the back door. suddenly, the door is     
          kicked open! budlofsky and matheson enter, guns drawn.       
          they see red.                                                
          
                                 red                                   
                    dale denton! it was saul and some dude             
                    named dale denton! they just ran out the           
                    back!
