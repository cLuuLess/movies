          int. cheung's mansion - moments later
          
          cheung, the leader of the asians, has a lavish mansion
          which is covered in ornate decorations and expensive
          merchandise. it is immaculately clean and organized.
          several armed men with earpieces stand in strategic
          locations throughout the house. cheung is reading a
          korean book alone in his study. the phone rings and he
          picks it up.
          
                                   cheung
                             (in korean)
                    hello?
          
                                 ted
                    cheung. it's ted.
          
          cheung sits up, shocked to have his opponent calling him.
          he snaps his fingers and two guards run in. he covers the
          phone.
          
                                 cheung
                           (in korean)
                    record this conversation.
          
          he uncovers the receiver.
          
                                 cheung (cont'd)
                           (perfect english)
                    ted. this is surprising. what would you
                    like?
          
                                 ted
                    cheung, i want you to call off your man
                    denton. i don't know what he is, a scout,
                    assassin, and frankly i don't care. i
                    just want him gone. i want him dead. if
                    you do this, i'll consider it a peace
                    offering, otherwise, you're asking for
                    war. and just in case you forgot, i'm
                    number one, and there's a reason for
                    that. you've got 24 hours to reply.
          
          we stay on cheung. he hails another guard.
          
                                                                   68
          
          
          
                                 cheung
                    ted jones is slipping. our assassin                  
                    failed to kill him, but it did rattle his            
                    confidence. it's earlier than planned,               
                    but we should strike now, while he is                
                    confused. let it be known-                           
          
          he turns to a picture of the asian ted killed earlier.         
          
                                 cheung (cont'd)                         
                    -li-youngs death will not be in vain.
