          angie and her parents try to make sense of what dale is         
          saying.

                                 angie
                           (on the verge of tears)

                                 robert

                                  shannon                                
                    robert! no!

          robert runs up the stairs to his bedroom.                      
          
          suddenly, saul bursts through the front door in a              
          panicked frenzy.                                               
          
                                 saul
                           (completely out of breath)
                    you... huff ...angie? dale! it's

          angie grabs a fork off the table and stabs it into saul's      
          shoulder.

                    dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!

                    what did you do, angie?!                           
          
          saul yanks the fork out and tosses it on the ground.         
          
                                 saul

          gun. he sees saul bleeding and screams. blam! he fires at    
          saul!
