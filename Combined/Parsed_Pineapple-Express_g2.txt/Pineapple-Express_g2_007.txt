          int. office building - later                                    
          
          dale, wearing a zerox hat, walks into the building.             
          
                                 secretary                                
                    can i help you?                                       
          
                                 dale                                     
                    just here to check out some units.                    
          
          the secretary nods and goes back to her work. dale              
          casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the           
          names on the doors. he glances down at his clipboard, it        
          read: walter tandum.                                            
          
          he finds the office and knocks on the door.                     
          
                                    walter (o.s.)                         
                    come in.                                              
          
          dale enters to see walter, a 40 year old accountant,            
          seated at his desk.                                             
          
                                 walter (cont'd)                          
                    oh! hey there. are you here to fix the                
                    fax machines?                                         
          
                                    dale                                  
                    nope.                                                 
          
          dale drops a blue envelope on walter's desk.                    
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                            
                    you owe american express $4068 dollars.               
                    sorry, but you've been served.                        
          
          dale turns and walks away. as he does, he notices a small       
          kitchen. he enters and is delighted at the array of             
          snacks and beverages. he helps himself.
