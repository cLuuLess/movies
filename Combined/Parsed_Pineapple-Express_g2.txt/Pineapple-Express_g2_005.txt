          dale, wearing a name tag that reads "garth", holding a          
          clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks                 
          repeatedly on the door. a woman cautiously answers the          
          door.

          dale shoves an envelope into her hand.                          
          
                                 dale

                    court order. you've been served.

          dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to        
          open the envelope.
