          ext. red's house - later                                        
          
          dale and saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.
          
                                 saul
                           (to the driver)
                    thanks a fucking ton, sharid.
          
          saul shuts the door and he and dale run towards red's           
          house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of         
          town. exhausted, dale and saul reach red's door. saul           
          knocks.
          
                                 dale
                    so, what's this guy like?
          
                                 saul
                    i don't know. he's short...and stout. so
                    he's like a tea pot. hehe.
          
                                 dale
                    well, do you think he'll be there?
          
                                  saul
                    i don't know, i mean, we are only...eight
                    hours late.
                           (beat)                                         
                    that's actually pretty late.                          
          
                                 red (o.s.)
                           (through door)
                    who is it?
          
                                 saul
                    red! it's saul. open up.
          
          red opens the door. he has a split lip and has clearly
          been crying. he tries to act normal. dale immediately
          suspects something is up.
          
                                 red
                           (sniffling)
                    who's this guy?
          
                                 dale
                    dale. nice to meet you.
          
                                                                    44
          
          
          
          red ushers them in and shuts the door.
          
                                   red
                    dale who?
          
                                   dale
                    i think it's    better if you don't know my           
                    last-                                                 
          
                                 saul
                           (oblivious)
                    dale denton. he's with me. no worries.                
          
          red notices their dirty clothes.
          
                                 red
                           (to saul)
                    what happened to your clothes? where'd
                    you call me from, man?
          
          dale notices red quivering as he lights a cigarette and
          becomes increasingly suspicious.
          
                                 saul
                    we were in the forest laying low.
                    thinking.
          
                                 dale
                    uh, red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
          
          saul finally notices red's dishevelled appearance.
          
                                 saul
                    whoa! dude, have you been crying?
          
                                 red
                    what? oh, i uh...
                           (feeling his split lip)
                    ...i got a cold sore, i've never got one
                    before. i started crying.
          
                                 saul
                    a cold sore? is that fucking herpes?
          
                                 red
                    ...uh, yeah, man.
          
                                 saul
                    ewwww! that's sick, man. do you know how
                    many joints we've shared? i told you,
                    man. this is from that time you ate the               
                    lollypop straight from the strippers sna-
          
                                                         45
          
          
          
                       dale
          saul. ask him.
          
                       saul
                     (to dale)
          okay, captain demando. can you just chill
          out, maybe? so, red. i gotta ask-
          
                       red
          okay, first of all, stop. what's this all
          about? that's what i want to know.
          
                       saul
          alright. well, dale's a servant for
          protest lawyers, and-                                
          
                       dale
          whoa, whoa! saul, i don't think...well,
          red, i don't mean to be rude but i don't
          think we should tell you any more than
          you need to know.
          
                       red
          fuck that, dale. this is my house, i
          deserve to know.
          
                       saul
          dude! let's just tell him. it is his
          house.
          
                       dale
          look. red, i just don't want to pull you
          into the shit we're in. it's just
          trouble.
          
                       saul
          don't be weird about this. if he wants
          trouble, it's his right to have it.
          
                       red
          whoa! whoa! i don't want trouble.
          
                       dale
          that's why we only need to clarify one
          thing - nobody's called about saul or the
          pineapple express or anything like that?
          
                       red
          no one. nada.
          
                                                                   46
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    awesome! look at that! everything's fine.
                    we had a crazy night in the woods, which             
                    i assume we can both put behind us like              
                    grown ups, and now we can use red's giant            
                    bong to get super-duper high.                        
          
          dale doesn't seem convinced. saul picks up red's huge          
          bong and starts to pack a bit of red's weed into it.           
          
                                 red                                     
                    alright, well, wicked. make yourselves at
                    home. i'm just going to use the ol'
                    telephone-o.                                         
          
          saul sits down and picks up a lighter as red walks             
          towards the phone. dale watches red, suspicious of his         
          odd behavior. red begins to dial...
          
          smack! dale knocks the phone out of red's hand.
          
                                 red (cont'd)
                    what the fuck!
          
          saul jumps up. dale snatches the phone and backs up.
          
                                 dale
                    i'm sorry! i'm sorry!
          
                                  saul
                    dale!   what the fuck are you doing?
          
                                 dale
                           (to saul)
                    we can't let him call anyone! he's acting
                    weird!
          
                                 red
                    fuck you man - this is my house!                     
          
                                 dale
                    i'm sorry. i just, i don't think i can-
          
                                 saul
                    dale! you fucking nut. you're stoned and
                    paranoid. just chill the shit out, guy!
                           (to red)                                      
                    i'm sorry, red. i shouldn't have brought             
                    this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.            
          
          without warning, red grabs a large ashtray filled with
          cigarette butts and whips it at dale. bam! it smashes him
          in the head!!!
          
                                                                    47
          
          
          
                                 dale
                           (in pain)
                    aaahhh!
          
          ash explodes everywhere as dale drops the phone and
          clutches his head.
          
                                   saul
                    holy cock!
          
          red approaches the cowering dale. saul intercedes.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    dude! he's sorry! wait!
          
          red punches saul in the face! saul screams and drops to
          the ground.
          
                                   saul (cont'd)
                    why!?!?!
          
          dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom,
          slamming the door behind him.
