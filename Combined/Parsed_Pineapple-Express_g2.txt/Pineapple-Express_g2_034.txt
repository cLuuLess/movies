          int. ted's living room - continuous
          
          ted (the big grey-haired guy) puts his portable phone
          back in its charger.
          
                                    ted                                   
                    fuck.                                                 
          
          the living room windows are covered by black sheets.
          workers are busy scrubbing blood stains off the floor and       
          walls. the dead asian man lies on top of bubble-wrap in
          the corner.
          
          ted walks into the kitchen where carol brazier (female
          cop from the murder, in full uniform, mid-30s) is playing
          with her gun.
          
                                 ted (cont'd)                             
                    carol, there's another name to run. dale
                    denton.
          
                                 carol
                    does he have something to do with our
                    friend in there?
          
                                 ted
                    if the asians have the balls to send an
                    assassin right into my home, we can't be
                    too cautious. the boys say denton and
                    saul are caucasian. maybe after their
                    assassin failed, they hired this outside              
                    guy denton to finish the job.                         
                           (pondering)
                    also, the boys said that saul mentioned
                    "going to the casino."
          
                                 carol                                    
                    "going to the casino"? i don't like that.
          
          carol holsters her gun.
          
                                                               cut to:
