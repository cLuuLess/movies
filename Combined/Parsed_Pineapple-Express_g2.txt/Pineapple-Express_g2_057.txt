          ext. alley - continuous
          
          saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. he looks
          at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps
          out and throws himself onto the hood of the cop car!
          
          the police liaison and dale see a body slam against the
          car and red liquid splatter everywhere, covering the
          windshield. they scream.
          
          wham! in the impact, we clearly see saul's balls getting
          rocked on the car! the police liaison slams on the
          brakes, causing dale to smash into the metal cage.
          
                                 police liaison
                    oh my god! is that blood? oh my god!
          
          she puts the car in park. as the police liaison gets out
          of her car, saul can be seen crawling around the back of
          the vehicle, clutching his testicles. the frightened
          police liaison looks at the windshield.
          
          she notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and
          quickly turns around. she sees saul jumping into the
          drivers seat.
          
          saul sees a shotgun beside the passenger seat. the police
          liaison reaches for her gun!
          
                                 dale
                    no! what are you doing!?!
          
                                                                    78
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    saving you. hold on, amigo. tango and
                    cash!
          
                                 police liaison
                    freeze mister! don't even...
          
          saul slams the car into reverse! he speeds backwards up
          the alley as the police liaison runs after them - gun
          drawn!
          
                                 dale
                    no! she was going to help us!
          
                                 saul
                           (in pain)
                    oh...my balls...i seriously think i
                    popped one...
          
          suddenly, carol (the cop from ted's house) whips her cop
          car into the alley! wham!!! it smashes into the rear of
          their car! dale turns around and establishes eye contact
          with the stunned carol.
          
                                 dale
                           (horrified)
                    it's her! the lady cop!
          
          saul slams down the gas! through the slurpee covered
          window saul sees the police liaison rushing towards them.
          
                                 saul
                           (motion at the police
                            liaison)
                    then who's that?
          
          the police liaison raises her gun.
          
                 saul (cont'd)                      dale
          noooo!!!                      aaaah!!!
          
          blam! she fires and the bullet punches through the              
          windshield! the police liaison dives to the side as they        
          zoom past her! they burst out of the alley. a moment
          later, carol follows, in hot pursuit.
          
          
          i/e. dale an saul's stolen cop car - continuous
          
          the car weaves through traffic.
          
                                 saul
                    the slurpee! i can't see!
          
                                                                    79
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    turn on the wipers!
          
          saul mindlessly starts grasping at switches in the car.
          he finally turns on the wipers, which wipe away the
          slurpee and reveal that the window is so badly cracked he
          still can't see through it. carol's car emerges right           
          behind them.
          
                                 saul
                    dude, i seriously can't see!
          
                                 dale
                    kick out the window! isn't that what they
                    do?
          
                                 saul
                    i don't know. okay.
          
          saul, with great effort, keeps one foot on the pedals
          and, with all his might, kicks his other leg through the
          front window. his leg punches straight through the glass,
          but he can't pull it back in!
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    oh fuck! shit!
          
                                 dale
                    get it out of there!
          
          suddenly, their car gets jerked to the side.
          
                                 saul
                    ah! ah! my leg!
          
          carol is ramming them from behind.
          
                                 dale
                           (hysterical)
                    she's following us! she's gaining on us!
          
                                 saul
                    her car's better!
          
          saul yanks at his leg and manages to wriggle it out of
          the hole. he begins to accelerate and realizes he can see
          where he's going through the hole.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    ha! i can see! through my leg hole!
          
          saul bumps over the curb and cuts through a large park.
          carol is right behind them.
          
                                                                    80
          
          
          
                                  dale
                     do something!
          
          saul thinks hard, then buckles his seat belt.
          
                                  saul
                     hold on. i've got an idea.
          
          dale does what little he can to brace himself. saul slams
          on the breaks. carol sees saul screeching to a halt and         
          slams on her breaks. she grunts and whips out her gun.          
          both cars come to a full stop beside one another.               
          
          she opens fire - blam! blam! blam! blam! blam! - bullets
          rip through the stolen cruiser. shattered glass flies
          everywhere. dale and saul desperately duck for cover.
          
          saul hits the gas and the bullet riddled car takes off.
          carol follows.
          
                                  dale
                     what the fuck was that?!?!?
          
          saul pops back up and begins steering again.
          
                                  saul
                     oh shit, man! i'm sorry! i thought she'd
                     keep going.
          
          the car bumps back on to a main road. carol follows,
          sirens blaring.
          
                                  dale
                     turn on the sirens!
          
          saul's hand flails around, grasping everything. he feels
          the shotgun and accidentally pulls the trigger-
          
          boom! the blast blows through the roof of the car and
          hits an overhead traffic light - shredding it to pieces!
          
                      saul                          dale
          jesus!!!                         shit!
          
          carol flies into the intersection on a collision course
          with saul and dale.
          
          crunch! a car smashes into the side of the carol's
          cruiser.
          
          as dale and saul speed off, carol emerges from the
          smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes.
          
                                                                    81
