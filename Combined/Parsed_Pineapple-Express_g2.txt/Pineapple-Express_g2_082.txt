          int. giant underground grow room - continuous
          
          dale and saul slowly make their way through the dense
          marijuana foliage.
          
                                   saul
                      look at all this fucking weed, man. where
                      the hell are we? is this some underground
                      weed city we don't know about?
          
                                                                   103
          
          
          
          saul suddenly grabs dale and pulls him down.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                           (whispering)
                    what's that noise?
          
                                 dale
                           (whispering)
                    i don't know! that guy just blew half my
                    fucking ear off!
          
                                 saul
                           (pointing across the room)
                    there's some dudes in here. i saw them                
                    when i got dragged down. and there's some             
                    kind of super-suit or something.                      
          
                                 dale                                     
                    were they armed?                                      
          
                                 saul                                     
                           (whispering)                                   
                    i don't think so.                                     
          
          blam! blam! blam! dale and saul both scramble along a row       
          of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them. they       
          continue running and then stop.                                 
          
                                 dale                                     
                    i can't hear them.                                    
          
          saul spots an air vent in the middle of the room.               
          
                                 saul
                    you could boost me up! we'll sneak out.               
          
          blam! blam! they are being shot at again.                       
          
                                  dale                                    
                    shoot back!                                           
          
                                  saul                                    
                    really?                                               
          
                                  dale                                    
                    yes!                                                  
          
          saul hesitantly takes aim and pulls the trigger. blam!          
          blam! blam!                                                     
          
                                  dale (cont'd)                           
                    now run!                                              
          
                                                                   104
          
          
          
          they run and turn several corners when saul suddenly            
          trips over a dead thug.                                         
          
                     saul                             dale                
          ah!!!                         whoa!!!                           
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                            
                    nice. you got him.                                    
          
          dale picks up the thug's machine gun. suddenly, a thug          
          appears behind saul.                                            
          
                                 thug 7                                   
                    lance? holy fuck! you sons-of-                        
          
          dale shoots right over saul's shoulder and nails the thug       
          several times.                                                  
          
                                 dale                                     
                    holy shit. i killed him.                              
          
                                 saul                                     
                    about time you killed somebody. you're                
                    the one whose supposed to be saving me,               
                    and i`ve killed two bad guys already.                 
          
          saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. dale          
          looks at the pipe, sizes up saul and himself, and takes a       
          deep breath.                                                    
          
                                 dale                                     
                    you'll never be able to pull me up, but               
                    i'll boost you up there and you just                  
                    fucking run for it, man.                              
          
                                 saul                                     
                    what? no fucking way, dale. what about                
                    you?                                                  
          
          dale cocks his gun.                                             
          
                                 dale                                     
                    don't worry about me.                                 
          
                                 saul                                     
                    whoa. that was awesome.                               
          
          saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop        
          dale's shoulders and tears the vent off.                        
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                            
                    you're a good man, dale denton.                       
          
                                                                105
          
          
          
          saul lifts himself in. suddenly, dale sees ted enter the     
          room and immediately go for his gun.                         
          
                                   dale                                
                    hold on!
          
                                   saul
                    wha-
          
          dale walks out from under saul, raises his gun, and          
          unloads - rata-tat-tat!!! ted ducks as the plants around     
          him are torn asunder. dale runs out of ammo.                 
          
          blam! blam! blam! ted shoots at saul, who narrowly avoids    
          the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. ted           
          redirects his attention to dale, who is running through
          the bushes. ted blasts off a few shots before dale
          vanishes into the foliage.
          
                                   ted
                    denton!!!
