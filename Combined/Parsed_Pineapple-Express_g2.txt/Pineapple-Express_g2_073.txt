          int. red's bathroom - continuous                                
          
          dale enters and is shocked to see red lying on the floor,       
          clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and          
          beer in the other. the music is coming from a small boom        
          box.

                           (a little out of it)                           
                    what? who the fuck!                                   
          
          red turns toward dale and picks up a kitchen knife with         
          his bloody hand.

                    good, man. i'm fuckin' tired.                         
          
          red drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint          
          and a sip of his beer.

                    it, man. i'm at peace.  cough                         
          
          red takes a hit and coughs. it clearly brings terrible          
          pain to his bullet wound.                                       
          
                                 dale                                     
                    red, i need you to tell me where ted's                
                    base is. he took saul, and i can't bail               
                    on him. i'm going to get him back.                    
          
          red stares intensely at dale.                                   
          
                                 red

          red heroic-ish-ly rises from the floor. he hobbles over         
          to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall. dale looks         
          in and sees several hand guns inside.                           
          
                                 red (cont'd)

          dale and red are in red's car, a ford fiesta, driving           
          through the countryside. dale stops the car 100 yards           
          from the barn.                                                  
          
                                                                  94

                    this is awesome! we're so gonna show                
                    those motherfuckers. think they can kill            
                    me? fuck no, you can't! not how i roll.             
          
          red gets out and walks to the drivers side. dale gets         
          out, gun in hand. red gets in the drivers seat.               
          
                                 dale                                   
                    what are you doing?

                    so, this is the backside of the farm. if            
                    you stay low in the grass you should be             
                    fine. if someone is shooting at you with            
                    an automatic weapon, zig zag. it makes              
                    you harder to hit.                                  
          
                                 dale                                   
                    you're not coming to help?

                    fuck no! i've been shot. by these guys. i           
                    was in shock before, but the air on the             
                    drive cleared my mind, i should get to              
                    the hospital. you saw reservoir dogs,               
                    right? i got shot in the best spot                  
                    possible. i could have a long and                   
                    fruitful life ahead of me. full of                  
                    possibilities. go get `em, slugger.                 
          
                                 dale                                   
                    but how do i get out of here if i rescue            
                    saul?

                    i've no idea. i'm sure it won't be that             
                    hard. kill some dude and take his car, or           
                    just take it or whatever. good luck,                
                    amigo!                                              
          
          red drives off. dale takes a deep breath, clenches his        
          gun, and starts cautiously moving towards the barn. he        
          checks to make sure his safety is off and he's ready to       
          fight. dale sneaks up on the building and pears in            
          between two boards. he sees budlofsky supervising as the      
          thugs load the van.                                           
          
                                                                    95
