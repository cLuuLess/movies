          int. dale's car - continuous                                   
          
          dale peels out of his spot and down the road.
          
                                 dale
                    okay, what do you know about ted?
          
                                 saul
                    what? ted? nothing. for all i know he's
                    tracking us with space satellites right
                    now! he's got grey hair, that's all i
                    knew.
          
          saul checks behind them.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    let's go to your place.
          
                                 dale
                    no way! what if they did see my license
                    plate!?!
          
                                 saul
                    okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a
                    motel, or a holiday inn.
          
                                 dale
                    well, how much money do we have?
          
                                                                   29
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    all i've got is the seventy-five you gave
                    me.
          
                                   dale
                    that's it!?!
          
                                 saul
                    well, how much money do you have?
          
          while dale gets out his wallet, saul opens dale's change
          tray. it's full of roaches.
          
                                 dale
                    uh...nine bucks.
          
                                 saul
                    well, shut up then! i've got more than
                    you!
          
                                 dale
                    fine. forget the hotel.
          
          a tense beat.
          
                                 saul
                    i wish we could just go nowhere.
          
                                 dale
                    okay...where's nowhere?
