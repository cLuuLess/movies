          majong. one of them instantly recognizes saul-

          the budlofsky and matheson bursts into the room. saul           
          looks around, sees a teapot and grabs it. he hurls it at        
          matheson and nails him in the face. the tea pot shatters        
          and hot water pours all over his face and hand.
