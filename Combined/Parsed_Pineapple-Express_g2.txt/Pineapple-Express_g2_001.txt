          ext. farmland - dawn
          
          in black and white, a black 1930s cadillac speeds down       
          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
          the road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
          ignoring the turn, the caddy drives directly off the road
          and through a massive field of emptiness.
          
          the car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
          general brat (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
          agent black suit (an agent in a black suit) step out of
          the car.
          
          although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
          general scans his surroundings with concern.

          agent black suit crouches down and pulls open a metal
          hatch in the ground. both men walk down the hatch and
          into the earth.
