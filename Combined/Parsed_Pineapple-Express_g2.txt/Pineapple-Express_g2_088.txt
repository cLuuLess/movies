          carol writhes on the ground as saul runs towards her with      
          a plank of wood. smash! he shatters it over her head.          
          carol drops, unconscious.                                      
          
          saul drops to his knees, exhausted.                            
          
                                 saul

          saul turns around to see matheson clutching his bleeding       
          gut with one hand and a loaded gun with the other.

          and slams into matheson, pulverizing him!!!

          machine gun aimed.
