          int. underground facility - continuous                          
          
          ted and dale are squared off. both are bloody lipped and        
          bruised. dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot         
          as they talk.                                                   
          
                                 dale                                     
                    you can't fucking take me. i'm young.                 
                    virile. prime of my life. you're old. old             
                    and dying.                                            
          
                                 ted                                      
                    i don't know who you are, denton, or why              
                    you're trying to ruin my life, but you're             
                    fuckin' dead!                                         
          
          ted rips off his shirt, revealing dozens of fearsome            
          tattoos and scars. dale quickly picks a grow light up off       
          the ground. ted does the same. the humming of the grow          
          lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle, squared        
          off.                                                            
          
          
          
                  ted (cont'd)                      dale                  
          aaaaaahhhhhh!!!!              aaaaaahhhhhh!!!!                  
          
          they both swing and their grow lights collide, sending          
          shards of glass everywhere.                                     
          
                                                                  108
          
          
          both receive several small cuts. the immediately charge        
          at each other and are soon grappling on the ground.
