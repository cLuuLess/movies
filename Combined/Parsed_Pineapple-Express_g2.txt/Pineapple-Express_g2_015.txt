                    you don't have to feel weird about it.             
                    they know how old you are and they're              
                    fine with it. they just want to meet you           
                    and see that you're a cool guy and that            
                    i'm not dating you just because you're             
                    older.

                    bunch of cases that i can finish                   
                    tomorrow. it's probably going to take me           
                    into the night.

                    i'm 19. i moved here from morocco.                    
          
          dale doesn't know what to make of mr. edwards comments          
          and looks.                                                      
          
                                 mr. edwards                              
                    alright, well this school is for students             
                    and faculty only. friends can't just stop             
                    by.                                                   
          
                                 dale                                     
                    dude, you may be a teacher here, but                  
                    we're about the same age, so don't get                
                    all high and mighty. it's not that weird.             
                    frankly, it's natural.                                
          
                                                                    12
          
          
          
                                 mr. edwards                              
                    well, in that case, get off school                    
                    property or i'm calling the police                    
                    liaison officer. angie, no offense to                 
                    you, but if this guy's dating someone                 
                    your age, it's because nobody his age                 
                    will date him.                                        
          
          then, four handsome and fit students walk by.                   
          
                                 handsome student                         
                    hey angie. you were hilarious in drama                
                    today.                                                
          
          angie smiles at the guys. dale doesn't like how all this        
          is going down.                                                  
          
                                 dale                                     
                    i'll wait in the car.
