          int. ted's house - continuous
          
          ted and carol are in mid-discussion, and rather
          distraught at that. behind them two henchmen take the
          dead asian man's body out the back door.
          
                                  carol
                    a fork?                                             
          
                                 ted
                    a bloody fork. in his girlfriends house.            
                    and the blood was fresh.
          
                                 carol
                    maybe he killed her, to protect himself.
          
                                 ted
                    or maybe it's the asians fucking with us.
                    what the fuck is going on!
                           (a frustrated beat)
                    any luck with the cell phones?
          
                                 carol
                    they smashed one and left the other one             
                    in the woods to distract us. took us an             
                    hour to find it. and we found denton's              
                    car, which was filled with all these                
                    strange disguises. these guys are for               
                    real.                                               
          
          ted slams his fist on a table. he ponders.
          
                                                                   67
