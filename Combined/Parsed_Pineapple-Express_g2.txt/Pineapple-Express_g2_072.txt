          bam! dale kicks open red's door and dashes into red's,          
          ready for anything.                                             
          
                                 dale                                     
                    hello? anyone here? red?                              
          
          dale starts looking around. he hears music and then sees        
          he's stepping in a pool of blood.                               
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                            
                    oh my god.                                            
          
          dale follows the music into the bathroom.
