          ext. forest - continuous                                        
          
                                 saul
                    i always liked smoking weed in the                    
                    forest.                                               
          
          saul lights a joint and starts smoking. he passes it to         
          dale. dale puffs. they look around at their expansive,          
          dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with       
          paranoia. saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky       
          as dale takes out his cell phone.                               
          
                                 dale
                    i'm going to go call angie. make up some
                    bull shit.
          
          as dale dials, saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his
          cell phone. he takes another hit, and then looks up to
          the sky again. he looks back at dale's phone. dale starts
          to walk off.
          
                                                                    34
          
          
          
                                   saul
                    dale...wait!
          
          saul snubs out the joint and runs over to dale.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    yeah, the phone...i mean, i don't know
                    how this shit works, but...can cops...
                    you said they might be cops...could they
                    triangulate our phones or trace `em or
                    some shit like that? i don't know. i feel
                    like i've seen that.
          
          dale stares at saul, then flips open his phone -  beep 
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    i mean, shit dale, maybe they can trace
                    them when we're not even on them!
          
          dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky. just then, a
          loud rumbling noise is heard.
          
                                 dale
                    what the fuck is that?!
          
          the rumbling gets louder.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    are we on fucking "lost"?! what the hell
                    is that?!
          
                                   saul
                    it's them!!!
          
          the noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys
          dive behind a tree stump. a moment later, a jumbo jet
          buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. dale
          and saul pop up.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    holy fuck. that was close.
          
                                 dale
                           (clutching cell phone)
                    you know what? you're right. we should
                    just get rid of them. we should just
                    smash `em.
          
          dale looks at his phone, which is a new, expensive razor.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    fuck. i just bought this thing. maybe i
                    can just take the batteries out?
          
                                                                    35
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    no! smash it!
          
          dale sighs, then smashes his phone on a rock. saul looks
          at dale, then hurls his phone into the woods as hard as
          he can, sending it sailing into the forest.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    shit!
          
                                 dale
                    what the fuck was that?!
          
          dale tosses the joint aside.
          
                                 saul
                    fuck! i was trying to throw it at that
                    tree!
          
                                 dale
                    what tree?
          
                                 saul
                    that one.
          
          saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    it was a cheap piece of shit. came free
                    with the plan. it must've smashed when it
                    landed.
          
                                 dale
                    who the fuck knows?!? i don't know!! why
                    couldn't you have just smashed it on a
                    rock like a normal person?
          
                                 saul
                    i was trying to smash it! how often does
                    a guy smash things? i'm rusty. fuck.
          
                                 dale
                    did you at least see where it landed?
          
                                 saul
                    over there, somewhere. wait! we could
                    call it!
          
                                 dale
                    with what? i just smashed my phone!
          
          they look into the scary dark depths of the woods. both
          of them are clearly terrified.
          
                                                                 36
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    man, it's not like they got mcguyver
                    workin' on the case. i bet they can't
                    even triangulate it.
          
                                 dale
                    well, then you shouldn't have said
                    anything, cause now you've convinced me
                    that they can!
          
                                 saul
                    fine! fine. let's just find the stupid
                    thing and get back to doing what we were
                    doin'.
          
          horrified, they cautiously inch into the forest.
          
                                 dale
                    do you see it?
          
                                 saul
                    dude, this is the scariest place i've
                    ever been in my life.
          
          they nervously walk on.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    you ever see that movie where all the
                    people are in the woods and they slowly
                    get killed?
          
                                 dale
                    the "blair witch project."
          
                                 saul
                    no...shit. that one's way scarier than
                    the one i was thinking of. mine had
                    arnold shwartzenegger in it. now i'm
                    thinking of the fucking blair witch.
          
          they inch forward, nervous.
          
                                  dale
                            (whispering)
                    stop!
          
          they both freeze.
          
                                  saul
                            (whispering)
                    what-
          
                                                                    37
          
          
          
                                  dale
                            (whispering)
                    sshh!
          
                                 saul
                           (whispering)
                    what is-
          
                                 dale
                           (whispering)
                    sshh! can you hear that?
          
                                  saul
                            (whispering)
                    what?
          
                                 dale
                           (whispering)
                    just listen.
          
          saul listens.
          
                                  saul
                           (whispering)
                    i literally hear nothing.
                           (gasp)
                    wait...
          
          suddenly, saul sprints off into the darkness!
          
                                    dale
                    saul!!!
          
          dale looks in horror as saul vanishes amongst the trees.
          
                                 saul(o.s.)
                           (screaming in pain)
                    arghhh!!!
          
          dale hears a loud thud.
          
          scared for his life, he sprints in the opposite
          direction! he weaves in between the trees, avoids some
          rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then
          slams half his body against a tree and falls hard.
          
          angle on: saul
          
          saul gets up, covered in dirt. panting, he looks around
          the forest and sees no one. he thinks he hears something
          and sprints off! wham! he trips on a tree root and slams
          into the ground.
          
                                                                    38
          
          
          
          angle on: dale
          
          dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe
          the dirt off his suit.
          
                                 dale
                    shit.
          
          saul hears dale and whips around, breaking a twig -
           crack 
          
          dale looks towards the noise, then sprints off.
          
          saul hears someone and bolts in the opposite direction.
          
          like chickens with their heads cut off, they both
          scramble through the woods trying to evade their
          imaginary enemies.
          
          dale spots his car! he jumps in and slams the door shut.
          he's about to turn the ignition, but stops. panting and
          wheezing, he sinks into his seat.
          
          bam! something slams into the car.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    aaaaahhhhhhh!!!
          
          dale sees saul banging against the passenger side door.
          
                                 saul
                           (muffled through the window)
                    let me in! let me in!
          
          dale unlocks the car and saul jumps in.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    let's go! go!
          
                                 dale
                    is there anyone even out there?!?
          
                                 saul
                    i don't know!
          
                                 dale
                    if you don't know then why the hell did
                    you run like that?!?
          
                                 saul
                    i don't know! i'm freaking out, man!
                    let's just go!
          
                                                                    39
          
          
          
                                 dale                                     
                    no! we're not going anywhere!                         
          
                                 saul                                     
                    but there could be something out there!               
          
                                 dale                                     
                    there's nothing out there, that's why                 
                    we're here. god, man, you scared the                  
                    fucking shit out of me.
