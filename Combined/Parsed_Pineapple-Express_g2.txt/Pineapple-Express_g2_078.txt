          int. observation lab - continuous
          
          dale and saul are still "humping" away.
          
                                 dale
                    this isn't working. turn around. i'm
                    using my mouth.
          
          dale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on
          saul's hands. suddenly, they hear approaching footsteps.
          
                                 saul
                           (whispering)
                    someone's coming!
          
                                 dale
                           (whispering)
                    yo - if i cough, i'm going to make a
                    move, if i cough twice, you take the                  
                    lead. got it?
          
                                 saul
                           (whispering)
                    what? no! what if you actually cough?
          
          dale stands up just as matheson walks in, gun drawn. dale       
          looks at saul and notices that he's managed to free his
          hands.
          
          dale coughs twice. saul shoots him a worried look and
          shakes his head. matheson notices. saul coughs twice.           
          dale shoots him a confused look. saul motions at him and
          coughs twice more.
          
                                 matheson                                 
                    hey man, whatever you're doing, i get it,
                    okay? so just stop it, alright? just cut
                    it-
          
          dale charges directly at matheson!!!                            
          
          blam! matheson shoots at dale's head! dale falls to the         
          ground, specks of blood hitting saul as he dives
          forwards, tackling matheson into the wall!                      
          
          the matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting dale's       
          motionless body. saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it.
          matheson gets to his feet. saul turns and-                      
          
          blam! he shoots matheson in the gut.                            
          
                                                                   100
          
          
          
                                   matheson (cont'd)                      
                    aaahhhhh!!!
          
                                 saul
                    holy shit, man! i'm sorry!
          
          matheson writhes in pain.                                       
          
                                 matheson                                 
                    aaahhhhh!!! argh!!! you shot me! i've
                    never been shot! help! help!
                    aaaaahhhhh!!!
          
          saul turns to see dale lying face down.
