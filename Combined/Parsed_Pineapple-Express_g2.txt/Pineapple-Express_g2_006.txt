          int. dale's car - soon after                                    
          
          dale is driving and smoking a joint. he looks at his            
          check list - it is a list of people he served that day.         
          he's only got a few left. he listens to a different talk        
          radio dj while playing music from a tiny ipod boom box          
          that sits in his passenger seat.                                
          
                                 talk radio dj 2                          
                    ...forget about area 51, roswell                      
                    sightings, atlantis and the boogie man,               
                    let's talk about real threats, threats to             
                    our home and security...                              
          
                                  dale                                    
                    fuckin' eh.                                           
          
          his ipod starts playing hot steppa by ini kamoze.               
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                            
                    nice! hot steppa!                                     
          
          dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his            
          joint; he enthusiastically dances in his car while              
          singing along.                                                  
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                            
                           (singing)
