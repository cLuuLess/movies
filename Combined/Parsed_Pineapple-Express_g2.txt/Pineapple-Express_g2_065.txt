          int. retirement home - continuous
          
          saul casually walks into the lobby. the elderly residents
          of the retirement home are milling around the massive
          common room.
          
                                 elderly woman(o.s.)
                    solly?
          
          saul turns and sees an elderly woman.
          
                                 saul
                    hey! mrs. mendelson!
          
          saul peers over her shoulder and sees budlofsky and           
          matheson walk in!                                             
          
                                                                    88
          
          
          
                                   saul (cont'd)
                    holy shit!!!
          
          saul runs for it, and they chase after him. he maneuvers        
          through the elderly like a pylon course, the thugs right        
          on his ass. he bursts into another room.
