          int. hardware store - day                                       
          
          dale and saul enter the hardware store, walking very            
          close together so that no one sees dale is handcuffed.          
          they receive a few odd looks as they search and locate          
          what they are looking for: saws. saul quickly finds a           
          sturdy looking hack-saw.                                        
          
                                                                    82
          
          
          
                                 saul                                     
                    okay, only one way to do this, hard and               
                    fast. bend over.                                      
          
          dale gets on his knees and bends over, pressing his face        
          up against the wall. saul begins to manically hack away         
          at the cuffs.                                                   
          
                                 dale                                     
                    ow! ow! hurry!                                        
          
                                  saul                                    
                    i am!                                                 
          
          suddenly, saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the         
          saw underneath dale's suit jacket.                              
          
                                 dale                                     
                    which saw do you like most?                           
          
                                 saul                                     
                    the brown ones nice, but the metallic                 
                    ones seems more...                                    
          
          they watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to         
          sawing the handcuffs.                                           
          
                                                              cut to:
