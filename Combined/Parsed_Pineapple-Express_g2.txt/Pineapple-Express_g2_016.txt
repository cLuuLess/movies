          int. dale's car - moments later                                 
          
          dale and angie sit in the parked car making out.                
          
                                 angie                                    
                    so, do you want to get some food?                     
          
                                 dale                                     
                    no...actually i can't. i have to go serve             
                    a guy.                                                
          
                                 angie                                    
                    now?                                                  
          
                                 dale                                     
                    yeah. it sucks. i'm sorry. we can hang                
                    out later though. you can come over.                  
          
                                 angie                                    
                    we'll see if neo is truly the one.                    
                                                                          
          
          they share a long kiss, and angie gets out of the car.          
          dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone       
          and hits speed dial.
