          int. red's apartment/bathroom - continuous
          
          frantically searching for the phone, red flips the toilet
          seat up and grabs it. he begins to dial as dale and saul
          sprint down the hall.
          
          just as red is about to finish dialing, dale and saul
          crash into the bathroom door! they knock it completely
          off it's hinges, slamming it directly into red! the phone
          flies into the bathtub.
          
                                 dale
                           (pointing at the phone)
                    saul!!! phone!!!
          
          saul jumps into the bathtub and begins stomping the
          phone. dale continuously slams his body against the door
          in an attempt to keep red pinned down.
          
                                 saul
                    what the fuck red!?! what the fuck is
                    going on!?!
          
                                 red
                    i don't know!!! they're going to kill
                    me!!!
          
                                 saul
                    you didn't stub your toe, did you?
          
          red stops struggling and tries to catch his breath. dale
          kneels on top of the door, keeping him pinned.
          
                                   dale
                    now tell us-
          
                                                                   49
          
          
          
                                 red
                    they're gonna come back and kill me!!!
          
          in an impressive show of strength, red shoves the door
          off him, knocking dale aside. he runs.
