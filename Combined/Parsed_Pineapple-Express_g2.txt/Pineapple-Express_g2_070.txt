          int. the barn - soon after                                   
          
          saul wakes up but can't see anything. from his pov we see    
          tape get ripped off his eyes and mouth.                      
          
                                   saul                                
                    arrggghhh!!!                                       
          
          saul sees a budlofsky wielding a knife. he struggles and     
          realizes that his arms and legs are bound. saul closes       
          his eyes, assuming he's about to die.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                         
                           (whispers to himself)
                    fuck. i regret everything.                         
          
          budlofsky cuts the tape away from saul's legs.               
          
                                   budlofsky                           
                    get up.
          
          saul gets up and hops out of the car. he looks around and    
          see that he is in a large barn. saul notices six thugs       
          talking as they move bricks of weed and cocaine into a       
          van.                                                         
          
          matheson appears and looks at saul with smoldering           
          hatred. saul sees that his face and neck were burnt from     
          the tea and the broken shards of pot cut his cheek.          
          
                                 saul                                  
                    oh fuck. that looks painful.                       
          
          matheson walks over, lowers to one knee, and punches him     
          straight in the balls.                                       
          
                                   saul (cont'd)                       
                    eeehh!!!                                           
          
          matheson whips out his gun and shoves it in saul's mouth.    
          budlofsky taps matheson on the shoulder.                     
          
                                                                    91
          
          
          
                                 budlofsky                                
                    don't. ted wants him.                                 
          
                                 matheson                                 
                    fine.                                                 
          
          matheson looks at the wheezing saul, curled over by his         
          feet, and punches him in the back of the head.                  
          
          matheson pokes saul in the back with his gun, ushering          
          him towards the corner of the barn. they come to an old         
          trap door. matheson opens the hatch and they descend.
