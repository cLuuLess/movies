          dale hustles towards the entrance of the building when he       
          sees several police cars parked outside, their lights           
          flashing.                                                       
          
          he sees a bunch of old people gathered on the front lawn.       
          doing his best to avoid the cops, he joins the cluster of       
          elderly.
