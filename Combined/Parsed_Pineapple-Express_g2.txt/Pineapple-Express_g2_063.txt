          ext. pay phone - continuous                                  
          
          as dale walks out of his phone booth, we see that saul is    
          on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a    
          pipe.                                                        
          
                                  saul                                 
                    alrghit, i'll see you soon. and i'm sorry          
                    again about the clocks.                            
                           (beat)                                      
                    ha! what a douche bag.                             
                           (beat)                                      
                    yeah, love you too.                                
          
          saul hangs up and exits the phone booth.                     
          
                                 saul (cont'd)                         
                    yo, so before we go on the lamb i gotta            
                    go see my grandma, okay? she was worried           
                    `cause i didn't show up to help with the           
                    locks. but before that i've got to smoke           
                    another bowl.                                      
          
                                 dale
                    are you joking? you're actually gonna
                    smoke marijuana?
          
                                 saul
                    why not?                                           
          
                                 dale
                    how can you smoke marijuana after what we
                    just went through? that clearly happened
                    because we were smoking marijuana.
          
                                 saul
                    no. it happened because those fucking
                    kids didn't keep that shit on the down
                    low. which is weird, `cause they really            
                    seemed like cool kids.                             
          
                                                                    85
          
          
          
                                 dale
                    if you haven't noticed, we're not very
                    functional when we're stoned, saul.
          
                                 saul
                    when i saved you with those slurpees i
                    was stoned. what do you gotta say to
                    that? maybe the pot is what gave me the
                    creative capacity to come up with such a
                    great plan! the beatles were high!                    
          
                                 dale
                    you didn't save me! she was going to
                    protect us, and now we're wanted for all
                    sorts of crazy shit!
          
          saul lights his bowl.                                           
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    fine. smoke marijuana. but you know how
                    "scarface" ends. face down, dead, in your
                    own fuckin' water fountain.
          
                                 saul
                    for one thing, i'm done dealing pot.
                    mostly, because i don't know where i
                    would get it now, but still. and "b",
                    fuck you, man. you can't judge me. we're
                    exactly the same, and this whole thing's
                    your fucking fault. you're the one who
                    dropped the roach!
          
                                 dale
                    it's not my fault!
          
          dale points at saul's bowl.                                     
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    it's marijuana's fault!
          
                                 saul
                    stop calling it marijuana!
          
                                 dale                                     
                    grow up, you fucking two year old.                    
          
                                 saul                                     
                    see! this is why you're a douche bag,                 
                    denton. because you think you're better               
                    than others, but you're just a dumb                   
                    pothead burnout, same as me.                          
          
                                                                    86
          
          
          
                                 dale                                     
                    maybe i am a pothead burnout, but at                  
                    least i'm not the dumbest most annoying               
                    guy in the world. the only reason i ever              
                    bought weed from you was because you're               
                    shit is so good, not because you're cool.             
          
                                 saul                                     
                    but you said you bought when you already              
                    had a few times, just to hang out?                    
          
                                 dale                                     
                    bullshit! i just like...liked having lots             
                    of different kinds of weed at once.                   
          
          saul takes out his wad of cash and throws half of it at
          dale.
          
                                 saul                                     
                    here. buy yourself a good last meal.
          
          he throws fifty more cents at the shocked dale.                 
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    super size it, bitch.
          
          saul walks off.                                                 
          
                                 dale                                     
                    saul! i'm sorry, man! i didn't mean all               
                    that! saul!                                           
          
          a sad dale starts picking up the money.
