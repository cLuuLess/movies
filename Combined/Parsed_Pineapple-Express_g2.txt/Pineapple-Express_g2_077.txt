          ext. barn - continuous                                          
          
          five asian men lay on their stomachs in the tree line           
          dressed in black and armed with machine guns. one of them       
          stares through a pair of night-vision binoculars while          
          utilizing a listening device. we see his view of ted and        
          hear what he hears.                                             
          
                                 ted                                      
                    well, we'll torture these two bastards                
                    and find out everything they know. what               
                    about the shipment? ready to move out?

                    we'll be good to in 10 minutes or so.                 
          
          the asian leader nods and does some hand signals to his         
          men. the acknowledge they understand. he holds up a             
          flashlight and flashes three times. from the opposing           
          side of the barn two other flashlights blink back. they         
          all get up and start to slowly move towards the barn.           
          
                                                                    99
