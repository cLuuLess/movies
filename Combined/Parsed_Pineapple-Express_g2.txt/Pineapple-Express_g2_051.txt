          ext. crackhead park - night                                     
          
          there are several tarp-houses set up, garbage all over,         
          and crazy/dangerous homeless people milling about the           
          park. a deranged looking homeless man walks over to             
          another one and starts pissing on his leg. they begin           
          fist fighting. suddenly, a half eaten hamburger hits dale       
          in the face and a bag lady comes up to saul and starts          
          poking him.                                                     
          
                                 saul                                     
                    hey, stop it. stop it. you wanna buy some             
                    weed, or, like, what?                                 
          
          the bag lady runs off.                                          
          
                                  saul (cont'd)                           
                    see, that's the problem around here.                  
                    target demographic has a real, uh, fickle             
                    attention span. you gotta wow `em.                    
                           (beat)                                         
                    hey! who wants some weed!?!

                    fuck this place.
