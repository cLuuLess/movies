          int. barn - continuous
          
          the barn starts to buckle, when dale suddenly leaps out         
          of the trap door, flames licking his heels. coughing
          profusely, dale stands in the barn, then realizes his           
          pants are on fire.                                              
          
                                 dale                                     
                    holy fuck! holy fuck! aaaahhhh!!!                     
          
          dale wriggles out of his pants and kicks them away.             
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                            
                    ow. ah. ow. okay... cough   cough                     
          
          he starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips        
          over someone.                                                   
          
                                   dale (cont'd)                          
                    saul!
          
          he grabs one of the unconscious saul's feet and starts to       
          drag him out of the barn. just a they exit, the barn            
          collapses in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of        
          burning wood. dale pulls saul onto the grass. saul starts
          coughing.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    saul!  cough   cough  you're okay!
          
                                 saul
                           (confused)
                     cough   cough  what the fuck happened?
          
                                 dale
                    we... cough ...we did it. we beat them.
                    we won.
          
                                                                   111
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    no fucking way. seriously?
                           (pointing at the fire)
                    how did that happen?
          
                                 dale
                    i have absolutely no idea.

                    so we're, like, in a drug war. that's                 
                    cool.

                    what's cool is that you came back for me              
                    man. you did, right? you weren't just                 
                    captured again, were you?                             
          
                                 saul                                     
                    hell no! i was scott-free. but how the                
                    hell was i going to leave you there after             
                    you came to save me? fuck that.                       
          
          they take a few deep breathes and each cough a bunch.
          suddenly, they see something moving in the rubble. red          
          emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. he           
          roles around in the dirt trying to put himself out.             
          
                                 red                                      
                    motherfuckers. motherfuckers. light me on             
                    fire? kill my fiesta? fuckers.                        
          
                                 dale                                     
                    red? you okay?                                        
          
          red pats out the flames and stands up, all charred and          
          covered in dirt.                                                
          
                                 red                                      
                    fuck yeah, i'm fine. i'm red. you're                  
                    makin' me feel like a broken record. now

          they all stand up. red puts his arms around dale and saul       
          for support. they start to hobble towards the forest.           
          
                                                      112
          
          
          
                       saul                                  
          what should we do now? can we go home?             
          
                       dale
          i've gotta get downtown, try and win
          angie back.
          
                        saul
          tell her you cut off your ear for her,
          like that crazy artist.
                 (beat)                                      
          but, seriously dude, your joking right?            
          she'll never take you back, ever. just             
          grow up and date a woman your own age.             
          
                       dale
          do you think we should have looked for
          the ear? they probably could've re-                
          attached it, eh? i mean, this ear thing
          kind of fucking sucks.
          
                       red                                   
          oh my god, they blew your ear off, man!            
          fuck that's gross. can you dudes switch            
          sides? i don't want to look at it.                 
          
                       saul
          don't worry, man. look at evander
          holyfield, he looks totally normal. and
          plus, i saw this thing on the discovery
          channel, they can actually grow ears,
          like, in a petri dish, or even on the
          side of a mouse. and you only need half
          of one. it'll be a fuckin' cinch.
          
                       dale
          i just realized i've 100% lost my job by
          now. i haven't called in for days.
          
                       saul
          who fuckin' cares? i thought you wanted
          to be a talk radio dude anyways? and,
          like, i never said anything, but you do
          have the voice. like, when i didn't know
          what you did, i kind of thought you might
          have been doing cartoon voices, you know,
          like that shrek shit, and that's why you
          wore a suit.
          
                       red

          love that shit, too. i...wait, say

                    main concerns, garbage pile up.                      
          
                                 dale                                    
                    saul, what're you going to do?                       
          
                                 saul                                    
                    work at a bong shop.

                    i'm still selling weed. fuck you guys.               
          
          they walk together in silence, delighted at their new
          prospects. after a brief moment, saul suddenly seems
          afraid. he starts nervously looking back towards the
          barn.
          
                                 saul
                    do you hear something?
          
          dale motions at his wounded ear.
          
                                 dale
                    all i hear is ringing.
          
                                 saul
                    dude, i'm kind of freakin' out. like...i
                    don't know...like, there might be someone
                    out there. i mean...how do we know we got
                    them all?
          
                                 red                                     
                    what the fuck are you guys talkin' about?            
                    i don't hear shit.                                   
          
          dale starts getting nervous, but tries to hide it.
          
                                 dale
                    well...the barn did collapse in a ball of
                    fire, and we probably each inhaled about
                    ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just,
                    you know-
          
          dale suddenly looks over his shoulder, but sees nothing.
          
                                                                     114

          saul grabs dale.

          red pushes himself off dale and saul and run into the          
          darkness.

          with the barn's flaming remains the only light in sight,       
          dale and saul run off into the endless, dark country
          side. and as enchanting music fills the air, we humbly...
