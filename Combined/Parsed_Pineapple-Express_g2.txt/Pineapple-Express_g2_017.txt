          int. saul's apartment - later
          
          saul silver is constructing a cross-shaped joint (two
          joints that intersect one another). pot and paraphernalia
          are scattered all over the coffee table. a large
          "scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. there is a
          knock at the door and dale enters.
          
                                 dale
                    what's up, saul.
          
                                 saul
                           (unpleasantly surprised)
                    what the fuck?!?
          
                                 dale
                    what?
          
                                 saul
                    i didn't buzz you in. how the monkey did
                    you get in here?
          
                                 dale
                    whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me
                    in. i-
          
                                 saul
                    that's fucked up, man! this building is
                    filled with fuckin' assholes. what else
                    is the buzzer for? fuck.
          
                                 dale
                    i'll buzz next time, man. i'm real sorry.          
                    i'm just not familiar with your,                   
                    uh...protocol yet.                                 
          
                                 saul
                    hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro.           
                    we're always cool. it's those fuckin'
                    jaggoffs.
          
                                 dale
                    um...sure.
          
          dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch.
          
                                                                    14
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    brass tacs. i've got this new bud.
                    unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but
                    fortunately, it's hands down the dopest
                    fuckin' shit i ever smoked. and i've
                    smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
          
                                 dale
                    better than that blue oyster weed?
          
                                 saul
                    dude. seriously. it's like if that blue
                    oyster shit and the afghan kush i got had
                    a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest
                    northern lights and that red-ass espresso
                    snowflake had a baby, and then by some
                    miracle those babies met, and fucked -
                    then this would be the shit they'd birth.
          
          saul pulls out a big bag of weed. he places it on the
          coffee table as though it was his child. he pulls out a
          large bud.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    smell it.
          
          dale takes the weed and looks at it. it looks
          spectacular. bright red hairs and large crystals, huge
          purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! dale smells it
          and is taken aback.
          
                                 dale
                    what is this? it's spectacular.
          
                                 saul
                    it's called pineapple express. my guy red
                    told me it's when this hawaiian flood
                    takes special dirt to the weed or some
                    shit. it's pretty scientific. and i'm the
                    only guy in the whole city who has it.
                    and, its only ten bones more for a
                    quarter.
          
                                 dale
                    so...can i get a quarter?
          
                                 saul
                    no doubt. just let me grab my scale.
          
          saul walks into another room. dale looks around
          anxiously; he clearly wants to go.                              
          
                                                                    15
          
          
          
          a moment later, saul comes back into the room and sits
          down. dale notices that he didn't bring anything back
          from the other room. saul notices dale looking at him
          strangely.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    what's with the look? what?
          
                                 dale
                    where's the scale?
          
                                 saul
                    oh shit! the scale. be right back.
          
          saul hustles into the other room.
          
                                  saul (o.s.) (cont'd)
                           (from other room)
                    you know what's weird? how sometimes,
                    your brain just chooses to like, not keep
                    things in it, you know?
                           (beat)
                    fucking scale.
                           (beat)
                    shit. where is it?
          
          dale checks his watch and then looks at the door;
          suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross-
          joint saul was constructing.
          
                                 dale
                    holy shit! what the fuck is this thing?
          
          saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on
          the coffee table.
          
                                 saul
                            (nonchalantly)
                    ah, the cross-joint. you've never seen
                    one of these? not surprising. they are,
                    like, the apex of the vortex of joint
                    engineering. nasa built the first one in              
                    the eighties.                                         
          
          saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the         
          scale.
          
                                 dale
                    you can actually smoke that contraption?
          
          saul puts dale's weed in a baggie.
          
                                                                    16
          
          
          
                                 saul
                    you light all three ends at the same
                    time, then, you smoke it as it resonates
                    the main section, creating a "trifecta"
                    of smoking power. it's like, three times
                    as powerful as a normal joint.
          
          dale hands saul some money and saul gives him his weed.
          dale lingers for a moment.
          
                                 dale
                    well, be careful with that thing.
          
          dale gets up and heads to the door.
          
                                 saul
                    dude...you wanna smoke this thing with
                    me?
          
          dale turns around. he clearly wants to smoke it, but he
          tries to play it cool.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    i can't even light it on my own.
          
          dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.
          
                                 dale
                           (excited)
                    wow. so like, uh...so like, so like what
                    do i do?
          
          saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.
          
                                 saul
                    alright. firstly you light these two
                    ends. then i will light the tip, making
                    the trifecta complete. are you ready?
          
          dale nods and they light the joint. saul tokes hard;
          plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a coughing
          fit.
          
                                 dale
                    holy...
          
          dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a
          coughing fit.
          
                                 saul
                    it's...uh, it's good to cough.  cough  it
                    opens the  cough  capillaries...gets you
                    twenty-five percent higher.
                                 (more)
          
                                                                   17
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    and that, combined with the pineapple
                    weed, and the cross-joint  cough  you're
                    a good thirty to forty times higher. i
                    don't know the exact math, but, pff,
                    you're pretty fucking gong-showed. you
                    know what i mean?
          
          saul takes a toke. dale coughs harder and harder. he
          seems like he might throw up.
          
                                 saul (cont'd)
                    it's crazy. the better the weed, the more
                    i wish i could think of how to explain
                    what's so good about it, but the...uh,
                    the better it is, the less shit i can
                    think of in total, you know?                         
          
          saul passes dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all
          over his suit. slightly agitated, dale brushes it off.
          
                                  saul (cont'd)                          
                    okay, so, like, you've been buying from
                    me for, like, a few months now and i
                    really gotta ask.
                           (beat)
                    what's with the suit?
          
                                 dale
                    i'm a process server.
          
                                 saul
                    you`re a servant? like, a butler.
          
                                 dale
                    no, process server.
          
          saul looks confused.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    i'm hired to give people papers they                 
                    don't want. it's pretty much the easiest
                    job on earth.                                        
          
                                 saul
                    nice, man. where'd you get that job?
          
          dale takes a big hit from the joint.
          
                                 dale
                    well...uh, i got a totally useless degree
                    two years ago, then i did nothing for a
                    year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked
                    me up.                                               
          
                                                                 18
          
          
          
          they both revel in the thought.                              
          
                                 dale (cont'd)                         
                    i got it pretty sweet, though. today? i            
                    smoked like five joints, gave out some             
                    pieces of paper, and i ate some burger             
                    king-
          
                                 saul
                    hey man, did you get those new chicken
                    fries?
          
          dale passes the join to saul.
          
                                 dale
                    yeah man. i'd get on that shit. they're
                    fucking mind blowing. so, then i hot-              
                    boxed my car and then...got some action            
                    from my girlfriend.                                
          
          saul laughs at this.
          
                                 saul
                    does she smoke pot?
          
                                 dale

                    biography.                                         
          
                                 dale

                    yeah, it's awesome, although i think               
                    she's getting old enough where she's               
                    realizing i don't do much. and these high

                                 dale

                                 saul                                   
                    hey! you're right, man. i never thought             
                    of it like that.                                    
          
                                 dale                                   
                    you can actually do whatever the hell you           
                    want. you get to sleep all day and people           
                    come buy weed at night.                             
          
          dale passes saul the joint.                                   
          
                                 saul                                   
                    that's totally true. except tomorrow.               
                    thanks to that bitch daylight savings, i            
                    gotta go change my grandma's clocks
                    forward at 7am. or 8am. i seriously can't
                    figure it out.
          
                                 dale
                    sorry to hear that.
          
          saul passes dale the joint.
          
                                 saul
                    yo, so, like, what have these people done
                    that you go after?
          
                                 dale
                    let's see...tonight i'm going after-
          
          dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket.
          
                                 dale (cont'd)
                    ted jones. he forgot to pay his-
          
                                 saul
                    dude! my guy, red, gets his weed from a
                    ted jones. he's, like, #1 supplier in
                    town. maybe it's him!
          
                                 dale
                    i doubt that, man. there's probably a lot
                    of ted joneses's out there.                         
          
                                 saul
                    yeah, but not like this one, man! he's
                    what i want to be one day. he's like the
                    "jesus of weed". so...i guess he's like
                    jah. or scarface.
          
                                                                    20
          
          
          
          saul points to his scarface poster. the joint ends. after
          a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a
          conversation burnt out with the joint. they sit in
          awkward silence. dale gets up.                                  
          
                                 dale
                    well saul, that was crazy. thanks.
          
                                 saul
                    no worries dude, peace.
          
          they slap each other five and dale exits. saul turns on
          the tv. saved by the bell is on. it makes saul chuckle.
