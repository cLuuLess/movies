          int. hallway - continuous                                       
          
          as saul runs through the hall, budlofksy and matheson           
          appear.                                                         
          
                                   matheson                               
                    eat it!                                               
          
          matheson whip out his gun and fires - blam! the bullet          
          whizzes past saul and two elderly men, who don't even           
          flinch, and then shatters a distant window. saul turns          
          the corner and-                                                 
          
          bam! he slams into someone, sending the person crashing         
          to the ground.                                                  
          
                                 injured person                           
                    ow! shit...ow, ow, ow!                                
          
          saul looks, terrified he's hurt an old person, but sees         
          it is a young male nurse. he runs for it and sees an open       
          door with chatter coming from inside. he runs into-
