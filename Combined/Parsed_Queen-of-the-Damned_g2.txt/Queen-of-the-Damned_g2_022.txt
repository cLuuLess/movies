40   int. library - talamasca inner council chamber - night           40

     lestat's face appears on a video screen in front of a room
     lined from floor to ceiling with leather-bound books, ancient
     scrolls. subjects are marked, werewolves, poltergeists,
     possession...

     superimpose:    secret order of the talamasca: center for
                     paranormal studies: london headquarters

     jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive
     and imposing group of 10 talamascans, wearing demure
     suits.

     jesse is excited, a bit nervous, hoping to impress. she
     holds a remote which controls images appearing on the
     large video screen. clips from lestat's press conference
     continue. jesse gazes out at the talamascans.

                                jesse
                  i have reason to believe lestat's
                  the real thing. a vampire. and
                  an ancient one.

                                talamascan #1
                  i don't know, jesse. it looks to
                  me like the guy's got a good p.r.
                  man with a flair for the
                  theatrical.

                                jesse
                         (leans forward,
                          eagerly)
                  it would appear that way. but
                  have you listened to his songs?
                  read his lyrics?

     the talamascans glance at each other, surprised. shake
     their heads. a few laugh. they're not lestat's usual
     audience.

                                            (continued)

                                                            17.

                                jesse
                  well,i have. in one of his songs
                  he refers to a pub called the
                  sailor's arms. i think it's a
                  clue...

     she pushes a button, the lyrics appear on screen.

                                 jesse
                         (reading screen)
                  'where are you now? back in the
                  sailor's arms, somewhere in the
                  back streets of soho?' i tracked
                  down the old leases in london. it
                  turns out, in the late 1700's,
                  there was a pub right in the
                  backstreets of soho called the
                  sailor's arms.

     the lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving
     of a pub with the sign reading "sailor's arms."

                                 jesse
                  and it had a reputation for
                  dealing with black magic.
                  witches' covens, seances, that
                  sort of thing.

     quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear -- animal
     sacrifices. a corpses floating above a table...

     jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm.

                                jesse
                  and most importantly, reports of
                  people being lured there and
                  subsequently attacked by
                  bloodsucking fiends.

     quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings,
     blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman. a
     white-faced ghoul with fangs.

     jesse is smiling wider, excited by her discovery.

     on screen, an old map of london appears.

                                jesse
                  here's where you could find the
                  sailor's arms in old london.

     a modern map appears, overlaying the old map.

                                            (continued)

                                                               18.

                                jesse
                  and here is where it would be
                  today. of course the sailor's
                  arms is not there anymore. that
                  part of london is mostly old
                  warehouses, meat-packing plants.

                                talamascan #2
                  in a few years it will be artists'
                  lofts and pretentious french
                  cafes...

     jesse leans forward now as she talks.

                                jesse
                  yes, but right now there's only
                  one place to get a drink -- of
                  sorts. a private club -- in
                  exactly the same place. the
                  waverly arms.

     on screen, a photo of the waverly arms.

                                jesse
                  well, what happens at the waverly
                  arms now makes the sailor's arms
                  look like a happy meal at
                  mcdonald's.

     she pauses for emphasis, gazing at the faces of the
     talamascans, gauging their reactions.

                                jesse
                  it's a vampire coven. and
                  lestat's leading us to it.

     murmurs. many of definite interest. some of definite
     skepticism. jesse's face shines bright with her
     enthusiasm.

                                talamascan #1
                         (skeptical)
                  and what makes you think so?

     jesse smiles. pushes a button.     ready to receive the
     talamascans' approval.

     on screen, a new picture appears of several figures,
     white faces, dark clothes -- but they're very blurry.

                                talamascan #2
                  jesse, can you, uh, focus that any
                  better?

                                               (continued)

                                                               19.

                                 jesse
                         (excitement dampened
                          by embarrassment)
                  well... it was taken... while...
                         (clears throat)
                  ... in motion.

     talamascan #2 smiles at her sympathetically. jesse gazes
     out at the other talamascans, sees she's losing their
     interest.

                                 jesse
                         (quickly, trying to
                          cover)
                  but listen, if you look closely,
                  you can see they're vampires. i'm
                  sure of it. and lestat's leading
                  us to them and --

                                talamascan #3
                         (interrupting)
                  interesting. perhaps we should
                  assign someone to observe --

                                talamascan #1
                  oh please, based on this so-called
                  'data'? that's a waste of time.

                                  jesse
                  but... uh...

                                 talamascan #2
                         (looking up for a
                           moment, interrupting)
                  wait a second. who took this
                  picture?

                                  jesse
                           (a beat, softly)
                  i did.

     murmurs bubble through the entire group now.      they stare
     at jesse, dismayed.

                                talamascan #2
                  you went there?

                                 jesse
                  yes.   last night.

                                talamascan #1
                  and who gave you this directive?

                                jesse
                  no one.  i... just... went.
                         (quickly)
                  look, i know it was breaking
                  protocol and i'm really sorry,
                  it's just i think --

                                talamascan #1
                  jesse! you're just an apprentice
                  here! you must follow our
                  rules... or perhaps we need to
                  reconsider your position.

     she stares at him.

                                talamascan #3
                  for 12 centuries our mission as
                  talamascans has been to observe
                  and record paranormal behavior.
                  but never get involved. you're
                  getting far too close.

                                 jesse
                         (gesturing to photo,
                           defending herself)
                  hey, does it look like i got
                  involved? that is not called
                  involvement. that is called
                  running.

                                talamascan #2
                         (leaning forward,
                          trying to help)
                  but, jesse, tell us, what did you
                  see?

     jesse turns to her.

                                 jesse
                  vampires.   gathering.   i'm sure of
                  it.

     jesse steps from the podium, moving through the
     talamascans as she pleads her case. she talks a mile a
     minute, her passion rising...

                                 jesse
                  you have to listen to lestat's
                  lyrics. they're amazing.
                          (more)

                          jesse (cont'd)
                  many of the references could only
                  be derived from years of research
                  in the bibliotech de paris, which
                  seems unlikely for a young rock
                  star in his early twenties. plus
                  there are historical details
                  dating back hundreds of years
                  lestat describes that don't exist
                  anywhere... except in our library.
                  he refers to marius, the great
                  white lord, who ruled over a group
                  of islands off the bay of naples
                  in the late 18th century. what
                  i'm trying to say here, and maybe
                  i'm not doing the best job of it,
                  is that lestat may be the oldest
                  and most powerful vampire ever
                  documented!

     jesse sees some of the talamascans are again listening.
     but talamascan #1 shakes his head...

                                talamascan #1
                  it doesn't make any sense. why
                  would he be forecasting this to
                  the world? he's all but drawn a
                  map and marked an x. what
                  vampires hold sacred is keeping
                  their kind a secret. you never
                  name other immortals, tell where
                  their lairs are. they'd be hunted
                  down.

                                jesse
                  right. that's the best part.
                  lestat's not afraid to piss them
                  off. he wants mortals and
                  immortals to know he's there, to
                  know he exists. i don't know
                  why...
                         (glancing at skeptical
                          talamascan #1)
                  but this has never happened
                  before. don't you see? he's a
                  one man revolution.

     all the talamascans gaze at her a moment.       jesse holds
     her breath. has she gotten them back?

                                talamascan #1
                  and this photo is your evidence?
                  it's hardly conclusive.
                         (snorts)
                  c'mon. it looks like the blair
                  witch!

     the talamascans burst out laughing, even talamascan #2.
     jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. she's lost
     them, blown it. made a fool of herself.

     her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it.       it
     bursts out of her.

                                jesse
                  fine. well then, i guess i'll
                  just have to go back and get
                  better, more conclusive evidence!
                  maybe you just can't unravel all
                  the mysteries of the world out
                  there, by sitting around all day
                  in a dusty old library in here!

     as they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her
