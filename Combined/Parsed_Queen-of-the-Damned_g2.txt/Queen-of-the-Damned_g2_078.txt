145   int. lestat's room - night                                     145

      lestat stands by his bed, playing the ancient violin... a
      long mournful note. he stops a moment, lost in his
      thoughts. a flash of the first morning light reflects
      off the ancient wood. lestat puts the violin away. a
      tear of blood trickles down his cheek. his face is
      filled with sadness at what will never be. a word
      escapes from his lips.

                        lestat
                   (whisper)
                jesse.

      lestat draws the curtains and enters his sanctum where
      his coffin sits in the safety of darkness.
