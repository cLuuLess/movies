14   int. attic - just after                                       14

     the room booms with music, speakers stacked high on all
     sides, literally shaking the house to its foundations.

                                            (continued)

                                                           5.

     reveal the band members of satan's night out. james,
     alex and maudy stare at each other as if in some tantric
     trance, as they play their music -- alex's long fingers
     climbing up and down his guitar, maudy's waifish body
     sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music
     flowing through them while james, on drums, drives them
     further into it.

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  it was hard to believe these
                  beings were mortal -- so confident
                  in their skin. everything in my
                  body wanted to be with them. i
                  couldn't help myself.

     then, from somewhere in the room, an angelic voice begins
     to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in
     exquisite harmony. arching her neck in some higher
     ecstasy, maudy looks across the makeshift studio and
     suddenly stops playing.

                          alex
                  what the hell, maudy.

     seeing maudy's stunned face, alex and james turn to see
     lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of
     speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb
     of the guitars. slowly opening his cool grey eyes --

                          lestat
                  please don't stop.

                          james
                  what the f-- how did you get in
                  here?

                          lestat
                  the door, of course.

     james and alex look at the door on the other side of the
     attic -- they should have seen him. maudy stares at
     lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks --
     drinking maudy in with his eyes --

                          lestat
                  your music woke me from the
                  longest sleep. it's sublime. in
                  two hundred years i've never heard
                  anything quite like it.

                          alex
                  who the hell are you?

                                            (continued)

                                                                 6.

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  the question provoked an
                  irresistible urge...

                          lestat
                  you may call me the vampire lestat.

     as we remain on the stunned looks of the band's faces --

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  it just rolled out of my mouth.
                  with one simple sentence i had
                  betrayed everything about my kind.
                  betrayed our code of secrecy.

                          lestat
                  your struggles are over.

     suddenly from across the room --

                          lestat
                  all that you've ever dreamed of
                  will be yours.

     they spin around to see lestat now right behind them,
     smiling.

                                alex
                         (terrified)
                  what the hell is this?

                          lestat
                  your lucky day.

     they all stare at him, faces white.     a beat.     then james
     breaks into a big smile.

                                 james
                  cool.   we got our very own vampire.

     maudy and alex look at each other getting used to it.
     they break into smiles, going with it.

                                maudy
                  hey, vampire lestat, i've always
                  wondered... about keith richards...
