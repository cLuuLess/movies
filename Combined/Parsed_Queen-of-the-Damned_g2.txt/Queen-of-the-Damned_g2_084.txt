151   ext. death valley - from high above - dusk                   151

      we see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road
      toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky.
      a distant sound of drums beating chaotic rhythms is
      heard. as we fly closer, the drumming becomes louder and
      clearer. until we are right above an incredible scene...
      a mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock.
