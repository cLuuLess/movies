      roger now stands there, a nervous look on his face.

                        roger
                the... girls you asked for, lestat.
                they're here, in the guest wing.

                         lestat
                ah.   yes.

      lestat gazes in that direction, pensive.

                        roger
                i was uh... just gonna go catch a
                movie at the chinese. i don't
                suppose you'd all want to...

      lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.

                        lestat
                no, thank you, roger.   we'll
                entertain ourselves.

      as roger leads lestat to the guest room, he can hear
      faint giggling. lestat turns back to the night. the
      pulse of akasha still echoes in his ears.
