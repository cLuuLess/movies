     jesse sits up with a start. she stands, heart pounding,
     trying to shake the dream off. we see on a bulletin board
     behind her, a flyer for lestat's concert. she takes off
     the headphones. walking over to the mantel above her
     fireplace, she picks up a solitary, framed photo -- holds

     young jesse (the girl from the dream) stares straight at
     camera. she is held in the arms of a red-haired woman,

     jesse puts the photo down, catches her reflection in a
     mirror, lit by flickering candlelight. her face is
     distressed, troubled by the dream. she goes to the
     window, stares out into the black night. the dark waters
     of the thames snake through the london cityscape. jesse
     blows out the candles. darkness.
