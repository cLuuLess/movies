60   ext. alley - later                                             60

     jesse goes deeper into a labyrinth of alleys, the street
     becoming darker with every step. in the distance she
     sees the blue light. figures moving through the fog.
     jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to
     get a better look... suddenly, out of the shadows, a
     bottle smashes... she starts, quickens her pace...

     runs straight into a bulky figure. a primal scream rises
     from her stomach. the figure is a homeless drunk, more
     scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the
     night. jesse presses her back against the wall.
     breathes. she inches around the corner...
