119   ext. sunset blvd. - continuous action                         119

      lestat and marius sit perched on a giant billboard
      advertising lestat's concert. down below, sunset strip
      is filled with goths, club hoppers, honking cars, a
      traffic jam.

                           marius
                      (sarcastic)
                   impressive. reminds me of mad old
                   druids running around chanting in
                   the forest. very primitive stuff.

                           lestat
                   out there. my fans. thousands and
                   thousands. they worship me.
                   millions of arms reach out to
                   embrace, beg me to come into their
                   lives.

                           marius
                   it's what you've always wanted.

                           lestat
                   with all my black little heart.

                           marius
                   do you think of anyone but
                   yourself?

                                                (continued)

                                                            72.

                           lestat
                   i only have myself.

                           marius
                   it may be time to get ready for
                   some company.

                           lestat
                   what's that supposed to mean?

                           marius
                   your music's woken a very old
                   friend...

      lestat looks at marius, trying to understand.

                           marius
                   can't you hear it? or is the
                   applause all you can hear now?

      marius becomes eerily still. a deep, somber tone starts
      to vibrate. the ground rumbles. lestat taken aback,
      remembers the scope of marius's power. lestat stares at
      marius, then closes his eyes...


120   close on lestat's eyes                                      120

      as the sounds of the world seem to fade away, revealing
      beneath the cacophony of mortals a deep pulse like the
      beating of a heart the size of a planet.


121   back to scene                                               121

      lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the world
      rush back in. marius stares for a beat, then --

                           marius
                   akasha has risen. she has taken
                   her king's blood. absorbed his
                   power. you've done it this time.

      lestat stares at marius, letting the knowledge sink in.
      then he grins.

                           lestat
                   good! i'm glad she's risen!     let
                   her come.

                           marius
                   don't you understand?   you must
                   stop this concert!

                                              (continued)

                                                                 73.

121   continued:                                                       121

                           lestat
                      (shakes his head at
                       marius)
                   200 years and the same broken
                   record.

                           marius
                   no. not the same! you've only
                   known akasha dormant. she too
                   will find you. she is choosing
                   her moment. she has come to
                   destroy you, lestat. and in her
                   wrath, she will devour everything
                   that moves. mortal and vampire
                   alike.

                           lestat
                      (smiles at marius,
                       softly)
                   well then, it's every vampire for
                   himself. just the kind of rules i
                   like. the rules you taught me.

      marius is enraged, tries to control himself.      lestat
      gazes at him, speaks steadily.

                           lestat
                   do you remember your first words
                   to me, marius? 'i am unknowable.'
                      (shakes his head)
                   i'd rather not exist at all than
                   have to live eternally as a ghost.

                           marius
                   and you're taking everyone with
                   you, you fool! we were once
                   mortals, too. it is our heritage
                   we protect!

                           lestat
                      (moving away)
                   such reverence for mortals! then
                   you should have left me as one!

                           marius
                   you're a monster.

                           lestat
                      (shakes his head with a
                       dark laugh)
                   said the vampire to his son.

      lestat turns, leaps off the billboard, disappearing into
      the black night. marius stands alone.

                                             cut to:

                                                               74.
