55   ext. beach - night                                           55

     below the brightest of summer night skies, lestat and
     marius walk along, talking intensely. the ocean appears
     to shimmer in the faint light of stars. in the distance,
     several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures
     gathered around.

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  my senses run amok, like a newborn
                  child. and as for my new powers,
                  i was beside myself with the
                  pleasure of it all...

                          marius
                  the trick is to find the way to
                  face eternity head on. the
                  spirit can be annihilated by
                  boredom just as the body can be
                  destroyed by sun or fire. my
                  solace, my delight, is witnessing
                  the unfolding of human destiny...

     lestat gazes at marius's eyes dancing with intellectual
     fervor. as they walk, they pass a group of teenagers,
     just younger than lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.

     lestat gazes over at them as he and marius pass, hidden
     in shadow.

                          marius
                  ... from christ to the dark ages
                  to the enlightenment, i've never
                  been able to divine what was coming.
                  that's what keeps me going -- i
                  can't wait to see what human
                  beings are going to do next...

     lestat nods, taking it in. they pass another bonfire.
     music floats through the night. an older man, 50, plays
     balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great
     passion.

                          marius
                  who could've predicted the
                  enlightenment? or hannibal and his
                  elephants?

     marius stops talking, turns. lestat is no longer beside
     him. marius turns back and sees lestat standing in the
     shadows, listening to the music. the young woman, sensing
     something, turns towards lestat in the shadows as she
     plays. marius goes to lestat, pulls him farther into the
     shadows.

                             marius
                  careful.

                                                             39.

                          lestat
                  but why must we hide, marius? we
                  are the powerful, we are the
                  immortal. we should walk fearless
                  in the open!

                          marius
                  shhh. the life of a vampire is a
                  life of discretion. we must sleep
                  during the day, when we are
                  vulnerable to the sun. mortals
                  must never know about us. it is
                  forbidden, for the sake of all our
                  kind.

                          lestat
                     (gazing at violin
                      player as it sinks in)
                  so i could never know her?

                          marius
                  not unless you wanted to kill her.

                          lestat
                     (beat, quietly,
                      intensely)
                  so i can never be known?

                          marius
                  you're known by me. i granted you
                  that. there are others of our
                  kind... though most are solitary
                  creatures.

     lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization.

                          lestat
                  my god...

                          marius
                  forget god. you're no longer in
                  his realm. now we must leave.

     relenting, lestat starts to follow. but the music
     quickens. lestat pauses, turns back. as if the music is
     calling to him.

     the girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and
     plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. lestat stands
     there frozen to the spot. the music pulses through
     him. he gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate
     movements intensely...

                                               (continued)

                                                              40.

     impulsively, lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face
     still somewhat obscured by the darkness. lestat starts
     clapping along to the music, exuberantly.

     the girl and father smile, nod to him as they play.
     marius, in the shadows, is fuming. lestat's eyes fill
     with the moment, the girl's vitality. he notices that
     sitting on the ground by the girl are several
     instruments. impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a
     violin. he studies the girl's playing again, then with
     his new powers, as if by osmosis...

     begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her
     movements.

     the girl and her father laugh, delighted with this new
     musician. lestat plays along with them, joyful,
     exhilarated. the girl's fingers fly. lestat's fingers
     pick up speed. faster. faster. a glittering torrent of
     notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.

     unconsciously, lestat steps closer to the music, into
     firelight. the father and his daughter become less
     certain, as they gaze at lestat's strange, pale, glowing
     skin, the luminous shine of eyes. but lestat is
     completely taken by the music, the moment. the father
     and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop
     playing. lestat looks up. sees terror in their eyes.
     the father is slowly backing away, pointing in
     horror at lestat.

                          father
                  fantasma!! teras!!

     lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps marius. he
     grabs the father. the girl drops her violin, turns, starts
     running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance.

                          marius
                  stop her, lestat!

     lestat turns to marius, shaking his head no in horror.

                          marius
                  you must!

     lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. she turns
     back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream...
     lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her
     mouth, covering her muffled scream.   her struggle is no
     use against his strength. reaching up to her neck, he
     touches it. he looks into her terrified eyes...

                                          cut to:

                                                              41.
