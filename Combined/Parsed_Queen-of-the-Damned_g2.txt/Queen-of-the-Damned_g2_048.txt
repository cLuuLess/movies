     jesse puts on headphones, listens to lestat's music.   as
     she opens the journal, lestat's music dissolves into
     violin...


83   flashback - int. villa - bedroom - lestat                      83

     lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie,
     playing the violin, with incredible passion.

     his playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the
     strings with a maestro's speed and precision.

                             lestat (v.o.)
               yes, marius was impressed with my
               thirst for knowledge... but it

               turned out that there was such a
               thing as knowing too much. there
               were things marius was not yet
               ready to teach me... and marius
               and i parted ways.

     suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across
     the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase. lestat
     comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the
     bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it.
     having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor
     when he sees something...

     carved into one of the floorboards is an egyptian eye
     with a hole dug out of its iris. stepping aside, he
     realizes he is standing on a manhole. a beat on lestat
     as he thinks... poking his finger through the hole of the
     egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set
     of steps leading down into the villa's basement.

                          lestat
               marius!

     no answer. lestat looks around wondering what to do.
     taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the
     stairs, peering down into the darkness.

                                                             60.
