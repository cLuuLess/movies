17   int. office building - soon after                             17

     a high-tech conference room. the band, sitting up front,
     is faced by an audience of over fifty journalists and
     then another fifty photographers and tv cameras. the
     room crackles with anticipation. roger steps to the
     podium.

                                               (continued)

                          roger
                  may i present the vampire lestat.

     he pushes a button and a black curtain slides open to
     reveal a huge monitor on the wall.

     every eye is glued to the screen... crackle, crackle.
     nothing. then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow
     appears... lestat. his voice booms out over the crowd.

                          lestat
                  good evening. i'm so sorry i'm
                  late. i was just having my...
                  breakfast.

     then lestat leans forward into the light. hushed
     whispers move through the crowd. lestat's eyes burn
     unnaturally bright. his white skin absolutely glows,
     luminous. lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile.
     then grins wider, revealing his fangs.

                          journalist
                  excellent makeup job.   marilyn
                  manson, look out...

     a thousand questions suddenly burst out of the
     journalists.

                          roger
                  hey, hey! we're gonna keep this
                  short here! one at a time. you!

     he points to a pretty french journalist.

                          pretty french journalist
                  so, lestat. you say you're a
                  real vampire. correct me if i'm
                  wrong, but what i remember about
                  vampires is you guys usually keep
                  your identity secret.

                          lestat
                  yes. but why hide it in this day
                  and age? i've hidden in the
                  shadows for centuries. it's time
                  to share myself with the world.

                                             (continued)

                                                             9.

     in the corner, roger gives a big winking smile to the
     camera crew. the journalists smile, playing along. a
     younger, hipper music magazine journalist pipes in...

                          music journalist
                  and it doesn't hurt the record
                  sales, huh? your album just
                  topped all kinds of sales records.

                          lestat
                  our label isn't complaining, no.

                                pretty french journalist
                  could you prove it? you know give
                  us a demonstration of your powers?

                          lestat
                  if you like, i'll give you a
                  private demonstration in your
                  hotel room tonight.

     the journalists laugh. the french journalist looks a
     little frightened/fascinated by lestat's leer.

                                lifestyle journalist
                  why not a demo at your own house?
                  i mean, what's with all the
                  secrecy about where you stay? is
                  it true you move residences every
                  few days?

                                lestat
                         (smiles, giving away
                          nothing)
                  after calling one stone tomb home
                  sweet home for so long, i like to
                  experience as much diversity as i
                  can. wouldn't you?

     the lifestyle journalist smiles.

                          music journalist
                  there are a lot of rumors flying
                  around the internet about the
                  hidden meaning in your lyrics,
                  that you're giving away 'vampire
                  secrets.' something in all that?

                  maybe i'm trying to resurrect a
                  few old friends with my words.
                  daring them to come out.
