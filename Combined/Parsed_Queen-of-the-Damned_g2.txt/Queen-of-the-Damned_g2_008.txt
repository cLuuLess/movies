15   ext. skies - night                                               15

     flying across night skies, as the distinctive dark sound
     of satan's night out kicks in to join lestat's soaring
     voice.

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  it was a bold move, i admit. but
                  from that moment on, they were my
                  friends, my children, my band.
                  together we rode on the wave of my
                  preternatural ambition to
                  superstardom, giving the world a
                  new god... me.

     we come across the city lights of london. below, police
     cars section off a few blocks around a very sleek,
     ultramodern office building where a huge crowd has
     gathered.
