184   ext. akasha's plantation villa - night                         184

      lestat and akasha stand on a cliff-top. wind rips
      through the trees. everywhere, there are torches, and a
      million candles light the vast house. lestat and akasha
      glide past the forest of exotic flowers... past the
      fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open french
      doors. long white curtains billow in the sea wind.

                        lestat
                where are we?

                        akasha
                we are home.

                        lestat
                you live here?

                        akasha
                we live everywhere and anywhere we
                choose. the world is our garden.
