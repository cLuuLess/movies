85   int. marius's villa - underground passageway                  85

     lestat finds himself facing a steeply descending
     passageway that stretches into darkness. he tests the
     stones ahead of him with caution...

     suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to
     life... in quick succession, they flare up and burn with
     an unnatural intensity. lestat, struck with curiosity
     and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth.
     we follow lestat as he rounds the corner and stops.
     there is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden
     doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that
     bars the doors shut from the outside.

     suddenly, the bolt flies up and splinters with a
     shrieking crack. the doors fly open revealing a bright
     light from within... lestat, apprehensive, continues
     towards the open doorway.
