91   int. marius's villa - night                                 91

     lestat lays in bed, feverish, his skin paler than ever.
     at the foot of the bed stands marius.

                       marius
                  (quietly)
               lestat?

     the young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some
     incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles.
     lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it,
     only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to
     the bed.

                       lestat
               more!

                       marius
               i don't think so, my little lord.

     lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost
     painful. lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with
     manacles and chains. struggles against them.

                       lestat
               let me go!

                       marius
               no. you've drunk the purest
               blood. seen the oldest of things
               -- far too much for one as young
               as you. you've been unconscious
               for days.

                       lestat
               god, her blood is like liquid
               fire.
                  (squirms)
               who are they?

                                          (continued)

                                                                63.

91   continued:                                                       91

                          marius
                  she... she is your mother, my
                  mother... akasha, the queen of all
                  who are damned. and he is her
                  king.

                          lestat
                  release me!

     lestat struggles with all his might. one of his manacles
     splits, releasing a leg. marius stares, surprised.

                          marius
                  she made you quite powerful.
                     (withdrawing a saber
                      from its sheath)
                  don't make me use this!

     lestat still struggles.       the manacles strain.

                          lestat
                  marius, please, just one more
                  time. i felt the sun. the light,
                  marius, the light!

     suddenly pressing the knife to lestat's throat --

                          marius
                  lestat, listen to me! i have
                  watched over akasha and her king
                  for 2000 years! they must never
                  awaken!

     lestat stares up at him.

                          marius
                  akasha and her king nearly drank
                  this earth dry when they ruled
                  over egypt. they drank until
                  they lost their will to drink.
                  they became living statues. and
                  yet akasha still sustains the
                  life force of all vampires. it
                  is believed what happens to her,
                  happens to all of us.

     lestat gazes up at him, taking it in.       marius moves
     slowly away.

                                               (continued)

                                                                64.

91   continued:    (2)                                                91

                          marius
                  if she were ever to rise, she
                  would again desiccate the earth!
                  she has no respect for anything
                  except the taste of blood.
                  immortal and human alike...

     lestat roars and struggles against his manacles.

                          lestat
                  you'll not stop me...

     marius stares at him, shocked.

                          marius
                  i hear her blood in your voice...
                  in all the years i've cared for
                  them, not once have they moved...

                          lestat
                  until tonight. and she chose me!
                  me! never you! you'll not stop
                  me!

     marius moves at super-speed, grabs lestat by the neck,
     and pins him down.

                          marius
                  you are part of a great coven!
                  you take responsibility for your
                  kind!

                          lestat
                     (snarls)
                  i must have more!

     lestat, lost, looks at marius, his eyes intoxicated with
     akasha's blood. marius steps back. looks at his
     fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment.

                          marius
                  i chose you for your bravery, but
                  i was wrong. you know only
                  selfishness. i can no longer trust
                  you... it gives me no pleasure to
                  look upon what i have created.

     marius turns his back on lestat.     lestat stares after
     him.

                                                              65.
