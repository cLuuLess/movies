     marius sits under the stars, painting, when his hand
     begins to tremble... suddenly, he drops his brush,
     startled by some unexpected feeling that passes through
     him. he stands bolt upright as a frightening gust of
     wind sweeps across him.

     lestat sinks his teeth into akasha's vein, drawing in the
     unimaginable font. a burst of image and color floods
     into him, as...


89   lestat's images                                              89

     of ancient egypt... power... supremacy... slavery... all
     impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red
     lips, blood spurting like a fountain...

     end of images.

     in the sanctuary, hovering over lestat, who lays on the
     stone floor in a catatonic state, staring. marius looks
     down upon him, the sconces above blazing high with
     flames. marius's voice echoing furiously...

                       marius
               what have you done, lestat?
               lestat!
