     james, alex, and maudy "whoop" with excitement.

                             james
                  we rock.

                          lestat
                  yes, i'd say i'm down with that.

     they all laugh.

                  i'm ready for los angeles...

                  i'm ready for death valley.
                         (jazzed)
                  two days till we go...

     through the broken glass we see roger slump into a chair,
     his nerves totally frayed.

                          alex
                  think we can call that a night.

     unhooking their instruments, alex and james start to pack
     up as maudy slowly approaches lestat and nuzzles his
     neck.

     he shivers with temptation. her hand moves down the
     front of his pants. lestat pulls her into his arms.
     leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent, closes
     his eyes and... suddenly opens them right at roger who
     looks on, extremely perturbed. smiling like the devil...

                          lestat
                  oh, the sweet song of her blood.

     roger stares on, terrified.

                          lestat
                  i'll hear it in my head all night.

     gently letting maudy go...

                             lestat
                  roger...

     he goes directly to roger, reaches into his open shirt,
     pulls out the crucifix around his neck.

                          lestat
                  i didn't know you were religious.

     roger tries to laugh it off. lestat sniffs the air. as
     roger backs away, he turns to open the door, stumbles,
     cutting his hand on a fallen shard of glass. blood
     trickles from the cut. roger looks up at lestat whose
     dark eyes stare intensely at roger's blood. roger
     quickly sticks his hand in his mouth. with a horrified
     expression, he realizes he's sucking his blood. he
     quickly heads out. but lestat is faster and reaches
     into roger's shirt pocket. pulls out a clove of garlic.     lestat
     shakes his head with a smile.

                             lestat
                  roger...

                                                                 27.

     roger tries to laugh. reaches for the garlic to put it
     back in his pocket. but lestat grabs roger's hand, blood
     trickling down his wrist. lestat speaks intensely.

                          lestat
                  be careful, roger.   very careful.

     lestat walks away.    roger exhales with relief.

                                                       cut to:
