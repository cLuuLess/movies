92   int. marius's villa - next day                                 92

     through the balcony we see the last warm colors of the
     sunset vanish into the blue of night. lestat awakens,
     his manacles removed. he stretches, shakes his head, as
     if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop...
     something has changed. marius's paints have gone. some
     of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes
     are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded
     marble floor.

                         lestat
               marius!

     no response.
