     closes his eyes.   a violent violin strain as we pull back
     to see...

     lestat standing alone in the bedroom, in a deep reverie,
     playing the girl's violin with incredible passion. his
     playing picks up speed as he works himself into a pagnani
     furor...

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  the faces of my victims haunted
                  me, rising behind my eyes,
                  reminding me of my fate... i
                  played for days trying to expel
                  the last bit of my human
                  feelings... and face the cold,
                  dark wasteland of eternity...

     the violin dissolves into lestat's rock music.

     reading the journal, listening to lestat's music. she
     hears the lyrics... "mine eyes dazzle, she died so
     young..." she looks up, her eyes fill with tears, moved
     by lestat's loneliness. she gazes into the dark night...
     then turns, sees her camera...
