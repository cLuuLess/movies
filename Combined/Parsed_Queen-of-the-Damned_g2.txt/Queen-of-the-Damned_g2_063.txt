118   int. lestat's mansion - living room - continuous action       118

      lestat bursts out the doors of his bedroom and looks down
      into the living room. marius sits on a couch, still
      dressed in red velvet, studying the rolling stone with
      lestat on the cover.

                             marius
                   lestat.

      marius looks up. the two vampires regard each other for
      a long moment. lestat is overcome with conflicting
      emotions. guarded smiles rise to their faces.

                           marius
                   it is good to see you, lestat.

                           lestat
                   and you. still wearing the old
                   fashions, i see.

                           marius
                   old habits die hard.

                           lestat
                   how did you manage to slip through
                   the 1950s in red velvet?

                              marius
                   i slept.

                           lestat
                   don't think you missed much.

                              marius
                   elvis.

                           lestat
                   elvis, yes.

                           marius
                      (holding up the
                       rolling stone)
                   you're bigger than he is now.

                           lestat
                   i'd say a few pounds lighter.
                   though, if you ever catch me
                   wearing a white jumpsuit, you have
                   my permission to slice off my
                   head.

                           marius
                   if someone doesn't get to you
                   first.

      lestat grins, feeling marius's disapproval.

                           lestat
                   live and let live.

                           marius
                   if it were only so simple, my son.

                                             (continued)

                                 lestat
                          (a beat)
                   how did you find me?

                                 marius
                   you forget. we ancients have
                   powers no ordinary vampires
                   possess... and i know you. i
                   remembered how you admired the
                   medieval fortresses in the
                   hilltowns of lyon.
                          (gestures to house)
                   all you're missing is the moat
                   and the cannons... which you
                   may need.

      lestat doesn't want to hear it.

                           lestat
                   come, let me show you what it
                   means to live in the light.
