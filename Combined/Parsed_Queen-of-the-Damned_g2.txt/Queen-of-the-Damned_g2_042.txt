     ext. busy street - continuous action

     in the midst of traffic on a busy street.     people walking
     by.

                                  jesse
                  jesus christ.

     she stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive.
     then it sinks in. she realizes -- lestat let her go.

     she glances back at the alley, but lestat is gone.

     she brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in,
     tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something
     else -- desire.

     what she doesn't see is...

     lestat in the shadows, silently watching her. he gazes
     at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal
     passion. she has affected him.

     he watches as she turns and runs away.
