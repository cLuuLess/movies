      jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires.
      she pauses at one of maharet. as jesse shifts, the glass
      over the painting catches jesse's reflection. jesse
      moves slowly until her face just covers maharet's. in
      the reflection, jesse's eyes now glow with maharet's
      luminescence. jesse stares a long, long moment.
