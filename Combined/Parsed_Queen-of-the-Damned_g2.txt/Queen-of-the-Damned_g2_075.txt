132   ext. griffith park observatory - night                         132

      looking out over the observatory's ledge, jesse can't
      believe what's just happened. she laughs, intoxicated by
      the experience.

                        jesse
                do that again!

      lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. her trust. for
      a moment she laughs like a child. then they look at each
      other deeply, feeling something. he wants to kiss her.
      she knows it. he turns away.

                              lestat
                and now for my next trick.

      lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.

      jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something
      stirring in her. magically, the wound heals up. she
      stares, impressed.

                                 jesse
                did it hurt?

                        lestat
                yes. for just a moment. but as
                the pain is more intense for us,
                so is ecstacy.
                   (gazes at her)
                you see, we love our victims.

                          jesse
                love?    i thought it was the blood.

                              lestat
                no, although the taste is so rich
                and sweet. love is the essence of
                the dark gift. the connection is
                so much more satisfying, brief as
                it is, than anything else.

                                             (continued)

                                                                    88.

132   continued:                                                          132

      lestat again becomes aware of jesse's pulsing jugular,
      the white flesh of her neck. he reaches out, touches her
      neck, strokes it. jesse shivers under his touch,
      terrified, but wanting more. lestat brushes his lips
      against her hair, her neck. runs his hands down her
      arms. she closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm
      of his voice.

                           lestat
                   as you drink, you feel the heart
                   weakening... it struggles even
                   though there's no hope. you feel
                   the life slipping away, the flash
                   of those brief years. the taste
                   of mortality you can no longer
                   experience... and it is
                   beautiful...
                      (pulls away sharply)
                   no 'relationship,' no commingling
                   can ever reach the heights of that
                   experience.

      but jesse steps forward.       lestat turns, stares at her.

      her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced.
      one button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens
      her blouse down to her navel.

      lestat stares as jesse removes a long, silver hairpin
      from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about
      her shoulders. her face remains aimed unwavering at
      lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.

      with her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the
      point across her breast. she inhales through clenched
      teeth... then settles as we see:

      the long incision go from pink to red; then the blood,
      like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping
      down her chest.

      lestat staggers. breaking their stare, he accepts her
      gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound
      itself. lestat closes her eyes... he comes up to her
      face, brushing his lips against her cheek. she
      shivers...

                           lestat
                      (groans)
                   your blood...

                           jesse
                      (murmurs)
                   do you like it?

                                                (continued)

                                                               89.

132   continued:    (2)                                              132

                           lestat
                      (losing himself)
                   yes...

      he comes down to her slender neck.     stares at the soft,
      pulsing skin. he bares his fangs.

                           jesse
                      (whispering, overcome)
                   do it to me... please... with your
                   blood i'll know you...


133   close on lestat                                                133

      he can't help himself.    he moves to jesse's white neck...
      closer... closer...

                                 jesse
                   i'll know everything...

      but suddenly her words catch him... his head flails as he
      tries to stop his natural impulse. lestat lets out a
      desperate cry and throws her aside. jesse gazes at him,
      surprised. he looms over her, angry.

                           lestat
                   you want to know everything. you
                   want to see what it's like. then
                   come! i'll show you.
