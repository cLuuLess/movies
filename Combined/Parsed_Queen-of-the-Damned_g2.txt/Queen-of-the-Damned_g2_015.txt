     jesse moves past rough-hewn columns, watching something
     with great curiosity. behind her, we glimpse a giant
     mural of names cut into the stone walls. a family tree,
     extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor.

     a grand party is in progress. there are about thirty
     vampires, all thin, pale and beautiful. an eclectic
     group, elegantly-dressed in indian silks, arabic veils,
     mixed with a few gaudy versace outfits. guests lean into
     each other's necks, showing blood-red tongues and fangs.

     she stares at him, nervous, intrigued.
