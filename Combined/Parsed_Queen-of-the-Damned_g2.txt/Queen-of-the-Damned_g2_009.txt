16   ext. office building - continuous action                      16

     through the crowd, a very long, black limousine snakes
     its way toward the building. rows of fans dressed as
     goths, ghouls and vampires scream out...

                            fans
                  lestat!    lestat!

     girls press their breasts and necks up against the
     limousine. thump! thump! fan after female fan flings
     herself on the car. groupies scream with pure
     excitement.

     confusion of screams as the door to the limo opens. the
     crowd's scream reaches a fever pitch as... james, alex
     and maudy climb out, ogle at the sight. roger smythe,
     their business manager (40s), gets out next, hustling
     them through the crowd.

     a wave of hysteria hits the fans. roger hustles the
     band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church,
     past the giant billboard with their own images written
     huge, lestat's smiling face above them all and the
     announcement --

     lestat -- live & undead -- october 31, all hallow's eve,
     death valley, u.s.a.
