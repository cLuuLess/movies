42   ext. around corner - just afterwards                             42

     bouncer #1 is now making out with one of the young sexy
     girls he let in, trying to get a hand up her dress.

     a cold wind suddenly blows, fluttering her skirt.    he
     looks up. a dark figure stands in the shadows.

                                bouncer #1
                  hey, perv, get the hell out of
                  here.

     the figure steps from the shadows.    the bouncer's face
     turns white.

     it's lestat...

     the bouncer starts to back way. the girl starts to
     scream. lestat clamps his hand over the girl's mouth.
     to the girl...

                                 lestat
                  you.   in...

     he gestures to the club. the girl turns and runs for her
     life. as the bouncer backs away, terrified, lestat turns
     to him.

                                            (continued)

                                                                 24.

42    continued:                                                       42

                                  lestat
                           (softly)
                   you.   no.

      lestat lunges like a phantom -- a flash of teeth -- as
      they fall from frame, the distinct sound of bone
      crushing. over this scene the band's song rushes in.

                                                       cut to:


42a   int. lestat's london house - that night                          42a

      lestat enters. dabs his mouth politely with a white
      handkerchief, the sound of the band practicing from
      below.
