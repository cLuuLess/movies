115   int. lestat's mansion - strange pov - evening                 115

      we find ourselves in the strange blue-grey world of a
      vampire's pov, walking through lestat's mansion. past
      his band, james, alex and maudy, laying in the studio in
      a hazy sleep from yet another night of debauchery.

      we move menacingly into... lestat's expensive living
      quarters, past the huge glassed-in space and into
      lestat's private hall, leading to his bedroom door. we
      enter easily, passing the enormous bed, and continue
      through into a smaller, darker chamber... over to
      lestat's coffin, stealthily approaching his "sleeping"
      figure laying closed-eyed and almost peaceful-looking,
      when...


116   lestat                                                        116

      bolts up   and looks around the room to see... nobody.
      lestat's   instincts are as alive as they could ever be as
      he scans   the room with all his powers, and to his utter
      surprise   finally sees...


117   wider                                                         117

      a painting leans against a wall, turned front-side-over.
      lestat gets out of his coffin and goes over to the
      painting with trepidation. he turns it over and then
      smiles to himself. it is a portrait of lestat as a
      rocker. the hand and style are unmistakable.

                           lestat
                      (whisper)
                   marius...!
