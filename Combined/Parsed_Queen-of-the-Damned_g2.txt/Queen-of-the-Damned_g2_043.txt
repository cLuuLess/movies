                  i heard that lestat keeps all
                  these girls in all his wine
                  cellars, and it's really nice,
                  and they give you food and
                  cable and weed.

                          groupie #1
                  oh, please...

                           groupie #2
                  that's what i heard. but you have
                  to let him suck you on your neck
                  whenever he wants. doesn't sound
                  too bad.
