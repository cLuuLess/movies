77   int. lestat's guest wing - soon after                           77

     camera moves out into the lavish room toward the two
     girls who are now dreamy, floating with the effect of the
     joint they are smoking. reveal lestat as he approaches
     the girls. looking up, they smile childishly at their
     host, then fall about laughing.

                          lestat
                  i don't think we've met.

                          groupie #1
                  oh my god... it's really you,
                  isn't it?

                          groupie #2
                  we want to be your slaves.

                          lestat
                  of course you do.

     he smiles.    she offers a joint.

                                                                56.

                          groupie #1
                  want some?

     lestat calmly shakes his head.

                             groupie #1
                  want me?

     circling the couches, he just smiles.

                          groupie #1
                  you hungry?

                          lestat
                  i'm always hungry.

                          groupie #1
                  we've got the munchies?    you got
                  any food?

                          lestat
                  vampires don't eat... food.

     the girls laugh nervously.       lestat laughs dangerously...

                                groupie #1
                  you hungry for something else?

     she opens her legs provocatively. pacing across the
     room, he stands before the girls. he curls his finger
     around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses
     his face.

                          lestat
                  mine eyes dazzle, she died so
                  young.

                             groupie #1
                  huh?

                          lestat
                  it's a very old poem of mine.

     losing enthusiasm, lestat walks away and drops himself
     onto a couch. with a clap of his hands, the tv switches
     on. he silently watches one of his video clips.

     the girls glance at each other, then, giggling, crawl
     over toward lestat. groupie #1 slides her hand slowly
     up his leg.

                                groupie #1
                  c'mon, don't you want to have
                  some fun?

                                               (continued)

                                                             57.

     she reaches for his belt. but he recoils at the touch
     and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace.

                          lestat
                  don't do that.

                          groupie #1
                     (giggling)
                  are you ticklish?

                          lestat
                     (deadpan)
                  i'm very ticklish.

     the second groupie giggles as well...

                                groupie #2
                  hey, you ever been tickled by four
                  hands at once? hey, can you take
                  both us, lestat? what'd'ya think?

     and at once they both start after lestat on all fours
     to tickle him. he gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the
     sight and gets down on...

     all fours as well as he leads them around the room in a
     childish game.

                                   lestat
                  i don't know.     let's see.

     they try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of
     them the whole time. the girls giggle as they pursue...

     lestat crawling just   ahead of them across the floor
     and... up the wall.    the teenagers keep giggling as they
     watch him ascend the   wall like a spider. they can't
     believe what they're   seeing as...

     lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down
     across the ceiling. the girls begin to giggle and half-cry...
     as they arch their necks all the way back to see...
     lestat crawling down the opposite wall. the girls sit
     open-mouthed with terror as lestat reaches the ground --

     he heads straight for them.

     the girls begin to scream... screams continue over...

     blackness.

                                                              58.
