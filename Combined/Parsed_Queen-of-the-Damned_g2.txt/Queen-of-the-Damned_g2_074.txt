130   int. guest wing - just after                                 130

      roger and lestat walk in.   a young groupie giggles
      nervously.

                        groupie #3
                oh my god, it's him!    it's really
                him...

      she turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to
      her. lestat stares, taken aback. it is jesse. dressed
      in goth gear. jesse stares back at lestat brazenly. a
      long moment.

                        lestat
                perhaps you would like a tour
                of the place... first.

                           groupie #3
                   oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.

                           lestat
                   roger... would you be so kind?

                           roger
                      (surprised, relieved)
                   sure. right this way, girls.

      as they start off, lestat puts up his hand, points to
      jesse.

                            lestat
                   roger. not that one.   leave her
                   to me...

      the other groupie pouts, disappointed. she goes out
      with roger. lestat turns to jesse... considers her...

                                      lestat
                   you must be very keen to die.

      jesse's heart pounds with terror.

                           lestat
                   the talamascans have become quite
                   stealthy. i didn't know
                   infiltration was quite their style.

                           jesse
                   it's not. i... i came on my own.

      he stares at her, taking her in.


                                 lestat
                   how did you find me?

                                 jesse
                   i've been tracking your manager
                   for days...
                          (gesturing to her
                           goth outfit)
                   then i figured out you simply
                   have to look the part.

                           lestat
                   clever librarian... you should
                   know, based on all your research,
                   that groupies don't ever find
                   their way out of here again.

                                             (continued)

                                                               84.

                           jesse
                   i'm not a groupie...

      lestat gazes at jesse's pulsing jugular.      he steps
      closer.

                           lestat
                   then why are you following me?
                   what do you want?

                           jesse
                      (terrified, in
                       a whisper)
                   are you granting wishes?

                           lestat
                      (smiles, in a whisper
                       playing    with her)
                   last wishes. what's yours?

                           jesse
                   show me what it's like to be you.
                   that's my last wish. grant it,
                   lestat.

      he stares at her, feeling some connection with this
      strange mortal girl. she stares at him with penetrating
      eyes. he again finds himself drawn to her. tries to
      fight it.

                           lestat
                      (turning away)
                   i don't have time for this.

                           jesse
                   all a vampire has is time.

                           lestat
                   maybe not.

                           jesse
                      (softly)
                   right. the covens are coming for
                   you.
                          (softly)
                   i understand why you're doing it.
                   you have to be who you are, no
                   matter what happens.

      he turns, gazes at her.       she steps forward.

                                                (continued)

                                                              85.

                           jesse
                   but how are you spending what may
                   be your last night on earth,
                   lestat? as you always have...
                   alone.

      jesse takes a breath, crosses to him, stands very close,
      stares up into his eyes. he stares down at her, amazed,
      his heart pounding. he breathes in her hair, the scent
      of her skin.

                           jesse
                   don't kill me yet. let's spend
                   our last nights together. share
                   it with me.   show me what it's
                   like to be you.

                           lestat
                   you don't know what you're asking!
                   i don't know what's in that
                   librarian's head of yours, but it's
                   not what you think.

                                 jesse
                   that's right. you don't know
                   what's in my head, lestat. do
                   you want to?

                                 lestat
                   i'll know when i kill you.

                           jesse
                   gee, lestat, that's a great way to
                   get to know someone. here. i'll
                   give you a preview. coming
                   attractions. this is what you'll
                   find.

      she crosses to him, stands close.

                                 jesse
                   i have this recurring dream that
                   i'm a child and i'm living in
                   this big house filled with
                   vampires. and every night when i
                   go to sleep, i wish to god the
                   same thing... you know what that
                   is, lestat?

      he gazes at her.    she leans forward.

                                                (continued)

                                                              86.

                           jesse
                   that i will have the dream again...
                   because in the dream i'm happy.
                   and the dream is more real than my
                   life... i don't know how, but i
                   know you, lestat... my life is a
                   big mystery and you, you have the
                   answer...

      he gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it.
      jesse moves even closer. he stares down at her, the
      softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat
      of her body.

                                 jesse
                   i can't go on pretending this life
                   of mine is real. i can't live a
                   lie... i'm just like you lestat.
                   we're the same...

                                 lestat
                          (softly)
                   are we? i seek the light.     you
                   seek the shadows.

                                jesse
                   no. we're looking for exactly the
                   same thing. you know it...
                   please. show me.

      he stares at her. her eyes gazing directly into
      his... suddenly...

                              lestat
                   alright!

      jesse breaks into a smile.

                           lestat
                   this may be painful for a mortal.
                   you're still attached to your skin.

                           jesse
                          (an excited whisper)
                   i don't care.

                           lestat
                   close your eyes.    don't breathe.

      her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, jesse
      holds one deep, hesitant breath and... flash -- with
      preternatural speed --

                                                               87.

131   lestat and jesse                                               131

      whisk through the night, flashing past trees and
      houses. opening her eyes for a moment, jesse watches
      the world whiz past her at incredible speed and
      suddenly -- they stop on a dime.

      jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at
      hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying
      out before her like a glimmering blanket.
