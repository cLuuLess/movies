108   int. airplane - night                                        108

      a tall, shapely female flight attendant sways down the
      first-class aisle of an airplane, her back to us. she
      stops by a seat where jesse sleeps uncomfortably. pulling
      out a blanket, the attendant drapes it over jesse, tucking
      it closely around her neck, then, curiously, the stewardess
      leans down.

                                                            68.

109   close on lips                                                109

      begins to sensually kiss jesse's neck. we begin to hear
      the beating of a heart, getting louder...

      the lips part to expose fangs slowly sinking themselves
      into jesse's skin. she murmurs in her sleep...

                             jesse
                   lestat.


110   wider                                                        110

      she stirs awake to see -- the face of akasha, her green
      eyes flashing bright.

                                             cut to:


111   jesse                                                        111

      wakes with a start.

                             jesse
                   akasha!

      jesse looks up to see the real attendant is standing next
      to her.

                           attendant
                   we've started our approach into
                   l.a. you should fasten your seat
                   belt.

      jesse nods and quickly fastens her belt, pulls it tight.
