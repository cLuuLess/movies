      making her way down a long hall she passes an amazing
      array of medieval tapestries.

      in a large room.

      she stands wondering -- eyes moving back and forth with
      rapid thoughts when... she sees a door at the end of the
      hall. walking a little faster now, she draws toward it
      as...

                                                               92.

      jesse as a little girl, wanders down a similar hall
      toward what sounds like a cocktail party. reaching the
      thick wooden door she peeps through to see...


142   back to scene (present)                                        142

      jesse stares up at an enormous mural dominating the far
      wall -- a mural of names, a family tree -- extending up
      onto the ceiling and down to the floor.


143   flashback - mural                                              143

      jesse, as a little girl, walking beside maharet, looks up
      at the mural.

                        young jesse
                   (furious)
                why can't i stay with you?!
                please, auntie maharet!

                        maharet
                i don't want you to go, but you
                must.

      a tear of blood trickles down maharet's cheek.

                        young jesse
                auntie, you're bleeding...

      jesse takes the tear and goes to put it to her mouth but
      maharet violently grabs her hand. young jesse is
      frightened.

                        maharet
                you must be with your own, my
                sweetest girl. i'll always be
                watching over you.

                        young jesse
                i want to stay with you forever.

      jesse stares into nothingness.   again the voice, but much
      gentler.

                        maharet
                forever is a very long time.

      jesse looks up out of her memory to see in the doorway
      down the end of the hall...

                                             (continued)

                                                                93.

                           maharet
                   hello, my princess.

                           jesse
                   aunt maharet?

      jesse rushes to her. stops. stares at her aunt's
      glowing eyes, the strange pallor of her skin.

                           jesse
                   you're a...?

                           maharet
                   yes. oh, jesse, i've missed you
                   so much, but i had to keep this
                   from you.

      jesse stands there, soaking it in.    maharet takes her
      hands gently.

                           jesse
                   oh my god, this is why... i knew i
                   was different. i knew --

                           maharet
                      (strongly)
                   come...

      jesse follows maharet to the mural of the family tree.

                           maharet
                   you are the most precious of my
                   great family...

                              jesse
                   am i...?

                           maharet
                      (strongly)
                   no. you are not. i was once
                   mortal, too. my sister died
                   before her child was one year old.
                   i took care of that child, and her
                   children, and her children's
                   children...

      pointing up to the huge family tree...

                           maharet
                   this is our family -- my way of
                   coping with eternity. the
                   labyrinth of life. the family
                   teaches me the rhythms and
                   passions of each age.

      her finger trails down the great line to a name --
      "jessica reeves"...

                           maharet
                   you are my most prized light. you
                   are what keeps me connected to the
                   world of the living.

      jesse stares at maharet, amazed.

                           maharet
                   when your parents died i took you
                   to india to take care of you.

                           jesse
                   and something happened there.

                           maharet
                   i stopped it from happening.    and
                   i will again.

      maharet stands close, gazes at her.

                                      maharet
                   jesse, you must stay away from
                   lestat. you must forget all about
                   him.

      jesse looks at her, surprised.    maharet smiles.

                           maharet
                   yes, i know about your new friend.
                   you think you love him, but it's
                   not as you thought it would be.

      jesse stares at maharet, surprised she understands so
      well.

                           jesse
                   i thought i was like him.

                           maharet
                   i know, but it is not who you are,
                   not who you are meant to be. you
                   have found that out now.

      jesse sits on a stone bench, confused.       maharet smiles
      sadly, feeling jesse's inner turmoil.

                           jesse
                   lestat's all i can think about...
                   i felt like i belonged with him.
                   now i know why...

                                               (continued)

                                                              95.

      maharet sits beside her, speaks emphatically.

                           maharet
                   jesse, you must forget about him.
                   you must trust me...

                            jesse
                      (gazes up at her
                       a long moment)
                   i missed you so much, aunt
                   maharet.

                             maharet
                   me too.

      just then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to
      illuminate the windows of the great hall.

                            maharet
                   you will go home to london in the
                   morning.

      jesse holds maharet's eyes.

                           jesse
                   but this is my home. this is
                   where i belong. why do you want
                   to get rid of me so quickly?

      maharet touches her face gently.

                           maharet
                   now is not the time to be here...

      the light is getting brighter.    maharet stands.

                           maharet
                   you were seeking answers. now
                   you have found them. the family
                   is who you are.

      maharet goes to jesse, wraps her arms tight around jesse.
      despite the coldness of her skin, jesse warms to the
      embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. then, beaten
      by the sun, maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns
      back to jesse, gazes at her.

                                 maharet
                   you will go home to london
                   tomorrow.

                                                               96.
