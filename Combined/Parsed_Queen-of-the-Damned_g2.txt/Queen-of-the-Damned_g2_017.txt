35   ext. tube station (london) - that night                      35

     fluorescence pierces the black night. jesse comes out
     of the tube station in a tight, short skirt, boots. she
     looks down the street. in one direction, a busy,
     brightly-lit street. jesse gazes at a group of tourists
     coming out of a pub, laughing. then she turns, looks the
     other direction. a dark street. she hesitates a long
     moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself,
     plunges toward the darkness, the laughter echoing, then
     dying.
