21   int. private club - same time                                 21

     a man in a dark suit plays pool. looking up over his
     dark glasses, his strange, luminescent, grey eyes stare
     up at lestat on the tv scornfully.


22   back to press conference                                      22

                          music journalist

                  death valley, just days away. why
                  just the one?

                          lestat
                     (grins)
                  i don't like repeating myself.

                                     music journalist
                  but these other vampires, aren't
                  they going to be pissed that
                  you're giving away their secrets?

                          lestat
                  i imagine they are, yes.

                          lifestyle journalist
                  do you have anything to say to the
                  other vampires listening out
                  there?

                          lestat
                  yes, as a matter of fact, i do...

     leaning forward, lestat smiles at the tv camera.
