159   int. backstage - night                                      159

      lestat emerges from his honey-wagon, splendid in his
      concert costume. he looks ready for business, whatever
      may happen. the band look at each other, then look to
      lestat. this is the moment. he smiles like a father
      at them.
                                           (continued)

                                                            100.

159   continued:                                                   159

                           lestat
                   come on, children.

      alex, maudy and james start beating out the rhythm with
      the crowd as they move through backstage. the drum beats
      rise to a crescendo.


160   back to crowd                                                160

      jesse makes her way through the throng, trying to get
      closer to the stage. suddenly the torches go out sending
      the place into utter darkness. a stunned moment. the
      place goes berserk. we see the dim figures of the band
      take their places. jesse desperately tries to push
      toward the front.
