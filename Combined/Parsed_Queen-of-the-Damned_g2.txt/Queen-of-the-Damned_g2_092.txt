180   ext. death valley peak - night                                  180

      lestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the
      desert, the tiny lights of the concert far below.

      lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him akasha in
      an extravagant egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold
      draping her godly form. lestat is awestruck. akasha
      comes to life...

                           lestat
                   akasha...

      akasha still says nothing -- she advances with a
      luscious, curling smile.

                           akasha
                   why so surprised, my love?    you
                   called, and i have come.

      lestat is awestruck. there is such an unearthly power in
      akasha's voice. everything seems to hum and vibrate with
      her breath.

                           akasha
                   never fear me, lestat. your
                   wishes have all come true.

                           lestat
                   my wishes...?

                                      akasha
                   you have yearned for a companion
                   to share eternity. you have cried
                   out to the world. i have answered
                   your call.

      akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to lestat.

                           akasha
                   you are so bold, like your music.
                   it woke me. you live your life in
                   the open, like i did long ago,
                   when i had a king.

                           lestat
                   had a king?

                           akasha
                   he's no more. you are my consort.
                   i've kept you safe -- alive.

                           lestat
                   you?

                                                (continued)

                                                              107.

                           akasha
                   you thought it was all you?
                      (laughing)
                   you have the ego of a king as
                   well. i know you, lestat. i know
                   that you crave to have the world
                   at your feet. i have come to give
                   it to you.

      akasha bites her own lip. blood trickles slightly across
      her chin. lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it,
      as the pulse of her blood increases... lestat looks at
      it, both wanting and fearful. wrapping her arms around
      lestat, she braces him, licks his face.

                           akasha
                   has your tongue lost its taste for
                   blood?

                           lestat
                      (melting)
                   never.

                           akasha
                   but you didn't kill the mortal
                   girl.

      lestat looks caught.

                           akasha
                   instead you kissed her.   now kiss
                   me.

      (note: shoot as practical, actor against plain night
      sky, as much as possible.) akasha rises above him,
      hovers over lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill
      into his mouth. lestat levitates above the ground to
      meet her as...

      akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until
      their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into
      him. lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers
      in him and floods his body with an electric rush.

                           akasha
                   be my king. forget about
                   everything else.

      lestat looks straight at akasha, his face flushed.    his
      eyes are empty of everything except her blood.

                           akasha
                   what's your answer?

                                              (continued)

                                                            108.

      lestat looks at her and then smiles. akasha's mouth
      spreads into a smile. flashes of brilliant light strobe
      over them as lestat moves to her, sucks again. there's a
      powerful rush of wind that engulfs them as they spin
      together, detached from time and space.

      all intercut with akasha's skin, her body taut and arching.
      lestat falls back in ecstasy. he shakes out his body and
      lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest,
      his groin as akasha's blood courses through his veins.
      akasha watches and waits. finally lestat grins boyishly
      through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of
      his hand.

                           lestat
                   can we try that again?

      akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a
      kind of purr/growl. lestat gazes at her as the sensual
      hissing seems to surround him. it is seductive and
      scary. lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.

                           lestat
                   show me the world...

      akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up
      into the air and off into the night.
