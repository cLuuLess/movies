48   int. talbot's chamber - same time                                 48

     a wood-lined room -- walls covered with books, artifacts,
     paintings. jesse stands before talbot. he fixes his
     eyes on her, pours her some coffee.

                          talbot
                  how's everything? you alright?
                  you sleeping okay?

                                jesse
                  yeah, i'm great. i just found a
                  vampire.

                                talbot
                         (considers her)
                  jesse... you're taking this lestat
                  stuff pretty seriously... why?

                                jesse
                  cause i think i'm on to something
                  pretty big. the most important
                  sighting talamasca's had in
                  years...
                         (beat, sighs)
                  jesus, i don't know, david... i
                  thought i was onto something...
                  maybe i didn't see anything...

     talbot takes in the dark circles around her eyes, how
     quickly she's emptied her coffee cup. he pours her
     more, smiles gently.

                                 talbot
                  you know we work in a really
                  strange field? the supernatural
                  is beguiling at times. it doesn't
                  like to just be observed, it is
                  only satisfied when it has drawn
                  us in completely. i know cause
                  i've felt these things myself.
                          (more)

                          talbot (cont'd)
                  that's what we have to resist, as
                  talamascans...
                         (as a shadow crosses
                          his face)
                  it's not always easy.

                                jesse
                         (leaning forward)
                  talbot. c'mon. you know me. i'm
                  not freaking out on you. i'm just
                  onto what looks -- alright looked

                  -- like a good lead. you're the
                  one who taught me how to do all
                  this. you're the one who taught
                  me to keep pushing and pushing...

     he still looks at her with a penetrating glance.         she
     looks back at him.

                                jesse
                  david. there's nothing else.
                  nothing is 'beguiling' me,
                  alright? nothing. c'mon.

     he gazes at her as she downs her whole coffee,
     registering her strong denial. he smiles at her,
     forcefully changes the mood.

                                 talbot
                  alright.   just checking...

     jesse starts out. looking down at papers on his desk,
     talbot calls out, almost casually...

                                talbot
                  well, all i can say is you're
                  really lucky you're not lying
                  dead in a gutter with two holes
                  on your neck.

                                jesse
                  i'd be even luckier if that damn
                  picture came out...
                         (stops in her tracks,
                          turns back, gazes at
                          him, amazed)
                  wait a second. so you do believe
                  me? you do think it's a vampire
                  coven.

                                 talbot
                         (looks up, eyes
                          sparkling)
                  yes. but not exactly for the
                  reasons you think. though your
                  research is top-notch of course...
                         (smiles)
                  come back here. i'm gonna show
                  you something.

     he goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of
     his office, covered with black velvet. jesse follows.
     he unveils them.

     they stand before an eighteenth-century painting. the
     interior of an enormous italian villa. there's a man in
     his forties with long white hair, back to us, but his
     face is reflected in a standing mirror.

                          talbot
                  what do you see?

                          jesse
                  they're all nightscapes. the
                  detail is amazing. mid-1500s.
                  florence.

                          talbot
                  right. and what do you see in
                  this one?

     jesse moves to the next painting. another nightscape, a
     giant medieval tableaux, circa bruegel.

                          talbot
                  and i know it's a dutch pastoral.

     jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the
     face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the
     bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints
     burned at the stake.

                          jesse
                  this man is in both.

                           talbot
                  right.   he's in all of them.

     jesse moves to the next painting, then the next and the
     next, all nightscapes set and painted in the style of
     different eras, all featuring a portrait of the same
     white-maned man.

                          jesse
                  have you --

                          talbot
                  carbon tested? yes. the
                  different paint samples are all
                  authentic. all painted at the
                  time of that particular style.

     jesse stops at a contemporary self-portrait.

                          talbot
                  it's marius, jesse.

                          jesse
                     (whirling around)
                  marius?! from lestat's lyrics.
                  i knew i was right.

                          talbot
                  yes, you were. good work.

     she smiles at him, victorious.

                                talbot
                  i've been personally tracing
                  him for decades. my little
                  obsession. the oldest vampire
                  ever documented. the closest
                  we've come to the original
                  vampire.

                           jesse
                  what do you mean the original
                  vampire?

     pointing to a larger depiction of a beautiful woman in
     egyptian garb --

                          talbot
                  there's a mesopotamian legend that
                  there once was a queen of egypt,
                  akasha, long before tutankhamen or
                  nefertiti. she was believed to be
                  the original vampire... marius
                  himself dates back to 400 b.c...

     jesse gazes at all the paintings, shaking her head in
     wonder, then speaks softly.

                          jesse
                  david, you've been tracking marius
                  your whole life. maybe he's out
                  there waiting for you right now.
                         (without looking
                          at him)
                  don't you ever want to just go and
                  find him and --

     talbot crosses to her.

                                     talbot
                  no. jesus, we are not talking
                  about having a drink at the
                  dorchester, jesse. you know that.
                  especially with the ancient
                  vampires -- the older they are,
                  the more powerful, the more
                  dangerous...

     he takes her by the arm, smiles down at her.

                          talbot
                  anyway, you don't need to go and
                  stake out some club. your time is
                  too valuable. i have something
                  far better for you...

                                   jesse
                            (surprised)
                  you do?

     he steers her over to a locked cabinet.

                                talbot
                  yes. and i'll tell you something.
                  i've never shown this to anyone.
                  no one else has proved themself
                  in the way you have.

                                jesse
                         (touched)
                  thanks. what is it?

     as he unlocks the cabinet...

                                talbot
                  oh you're gonna love this.
                         (glancing at her)
                  although i'm sure it will keep you
                  up nights to come with nightmares...

     he takes out an old leather-bound journal.    turns to
     jesse.

                                            (continued)

                          talbot
                  lestat's diary. i found it some
                  years ago. this is where you'll
                  find the answers you need.

     jesse stares up at him in absolute awe, taking it in.
     talbot gestures in the direction of the talamascans in
     the library.

                                talbot
                  they don't need to know
                  everything, right?

     she smiles at him.    he gives her the diary.

                                jesse
                  thank you for this.

                                talbot
                  my pleasure. when i took you on
                  as an apprentice, i knew it was
                  the smartest thing i'd ever done.
                  now you and i'll meet when you're
                  done... this will be our project...

     as jesse goes out, holding the journal, talbot smiles
     after her.

     but after the door closes, his gaze turns again to
     concern. he crosses back to the paintings, pauses a
     moment, staring up into marius's eyes. then talbot
     covers each with the black velvet.

                                                     cut to:
