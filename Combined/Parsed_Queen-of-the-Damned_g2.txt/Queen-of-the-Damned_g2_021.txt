39   ext. waverly arms - night                                    39

     jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the soho
     private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign
     and a dull blue light mounted above.

     jesse hears strange whispering. she sees now figures
     moving through the fog. one pushes a buzzer. jesse stares,
     barely breathing, her heart pounding.

     the figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright,
     glowing eyes. their fingernails are glass-like. a moment
     later, a slot in the door opens. the glowing eyes of another
     creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. the door
     closes quickly.

     jesse stands there, deliberating. she takes a step closer
     to the door. stops. takes another nervous step. she hears
     something, whirls around.

     another group of the strange figures walk steadily down the
     street towards her. jesse begins backing away. a hissing
     sound slowly fills the alley...

                                                      cut to:


     close on lestat

     smiling, revealing his fangs.

     reveal we are...
