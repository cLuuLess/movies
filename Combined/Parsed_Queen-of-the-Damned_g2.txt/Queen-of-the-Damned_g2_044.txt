76   int. lestat's bedroom - night                                76

     lestat enters the bedroom. behind him, lestat's dressing
     room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful
     suits made from the finest wools and silks. the
     gradation of colors is spectacular. peering out at the
     near-dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face.

     he crosses to the closet. opens a panel to reveal a
     safe. stares at it a moment. punches in the code. it
     swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in
     black velvet. lestat unwraps it delicately. it's the
     ancient violin.

                          lestat
                     (softly)
                  clever, clever librarian.

     he quickly puts the violin back, closes the safe door.
     he shakes his head, tries to laugh it off. but a shadow
     remains on his face. lestat hears a gasp. turns. roger
     has just entered.

                          roger
                  i didn't see you come in.

                          lestat
                  no, roger, you wouldn't have.

                                roger
                  so this house is fine i assume.
                  to your liking?

                                 lestat
                  yes.   for the moment.

                                              (continued)

                                                               55.

                                roger
                  we'll be here for what?    a week
                  you think?

                                 lestat
                  well... i wouldn't unpack if i
                  were you.
                                 roger
                         (sighs)
                  right... the... girls you asked
                  for. they're in the guest wing.

                           lestat
                  ah.   yes.

     lestat gazes at the door, pensive.

                          roger
                  do you want me to take them home
                  later?

     lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.

                          lestat
                  no, thank you, roger. i'll make
                  sure they're taken care of.

     roger nods, trying to hide his nervousness.      lestat
     smiles...
