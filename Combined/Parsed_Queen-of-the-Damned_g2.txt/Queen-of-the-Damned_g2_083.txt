150   ext. maharet's desert mansion - day                          150

      maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty
      desert. nothing for as far as the eye can see.

                           jesse (v.o.)
                   lestat is my destiny... i know
                   that now. i love you, aunt
                   maharet. good-bye.

      jesse walks away from the house. coming to a highway,
      she reads a sign -- "death valley 120 miles." just then,
      a vw minibus barrels down the road in jesse's direction.
      she sticks out her thumb... the minibus pulls to a stop
      on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. a vampire driver
      leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid
      with white face-paint and fake fangs.

                           vampire driver
                   need a ride?

      jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of goths and fake
      vampires. the vampire lestat blares from the speakers.

                           jesse
                      (smiles)
                   yeah.
