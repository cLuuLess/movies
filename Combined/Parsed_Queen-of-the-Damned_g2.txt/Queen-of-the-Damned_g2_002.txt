4   ext. tomb - continuous action                               4

    the figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.

                        voice (v.o.)
               in 1883 i suffered such a spell
               and decided to cease feeding on
               blood. just lie in the earth and
               let time return to its natural
               state...

    as the wind picks up, the leaves of a fledgling vine
    growing up the side of the tomb begin to rattle faster
    and faster, until curiously, time seems to speed up.
    night passes to day and back to night. shadows from the
    sun and moon drift across the tomb. as days and months
    fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns
    all around the tomb.

                         voice (v.o.)
                 i had hoped the sounds of the
                 passing eras would fade out, and a
                 kind of death might happen. a
                 kind of forgetting where i would
                 be healed from my wounds.

    the clip-clop of horses and the squeak of perambulators
    dissolve into the thump and scrape of industrial engines.

                         voice (v.o.)
                 but as i lay there, the sounds
                 didn't fade but grew with the
                 world.

    the buzz of prop engines melt into the sound of a jet
    streaming overhead. cars, machines, radio broadcasts
    merge into a medley of music from this century -- jack
    benny, muddy waters, elvis, hendrix, sex pistols.

                         voice (v.o.)
                 and gradually the world didn't
                 sound like the place i had left,
                 but something different...
                 better...

    as we draw closer to the now vine-covered tomb, sounds of
    the '70s, '80s, '90s persist...

                         voice (v.o.)
                 a new fearless attitude had
                 possessed the world, brave and
                 godless. i began to wonder if it
                 was not time to resurrect. but
                 the thing that eventually brought
                 me back -- the decisive thing
                 really -- came like a bolt out of
                 the blue.

    guitars strike, drums crack and the music slams out, raw
    and dark.


5   series of glimpses                                            5

    slender hands with long, painted nails, gothic rings, and
    a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.
    long hair, body piercings, celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored
    nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. in the
    confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or
    girl, but they're all young and beautiful. breaking in
    on the cacophony of music comes one guitar closer and
    louder than the rest.

     a scraping roar, like a bandsaw being twisted into the
     most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its
     emotion.

                          voice (v.o.)
                  a music so sublime, so deeply
                  vampiric, i had no doubt it could
                  be heard in hades. i had no
                  choice... it summoned me.

     an ultra-fast techno beat begins and the full-sound of a
     band rushes in, creating a sense of vertigo with its
     energy.
