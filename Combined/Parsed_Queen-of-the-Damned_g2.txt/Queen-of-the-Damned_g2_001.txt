1   ext. lafayette cemetery (new orleans) - night               1

    an empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. we
    hear the sound of footsteps approaching, then nineteenth-
    century boots enter frame. we follow them strolling past
    the headstones and mausoleums. the sound of a horse and
    carriage echoes in the distance.

                             voice (v.o.)
               there comes a time for every vampire
               when the idea of eternity becomes
               momentarily unbearable...

    as we reach an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and out
    of frame. pan up to reveal:

    a figure stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,
    silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.

                       voice (v.o.)
               the wounds suffered from love and
               failed friendships don't heal like
               a human's, but seem to only gape
               larger. the longing to be mortal
               returns, a longing for finiteness.

    a beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...

                                                  cut to:
