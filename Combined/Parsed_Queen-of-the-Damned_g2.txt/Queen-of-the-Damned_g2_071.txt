127   int. lestat's house (los angeles) - sound studio - night      127

      loud, intense music as the band rehearses. lestat
      creates a fantastic melody around the beat. he lets
      the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the
      reverb still ringing in the room. lestat hears
      something, turns. outside, in the hollywood hills,
      dogs are howling across the canyons like wolves.
      lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...

                                                             82.
