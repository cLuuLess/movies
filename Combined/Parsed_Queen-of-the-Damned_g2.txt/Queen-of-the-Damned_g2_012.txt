                       lestat (v.o.)
               come out, come out, wherever you
               are.

     camera booms down to reveal...

     a group of dangerous-looking vampires dressed in various
     styles, staring stony-faced up at the screen, their eyes
     glowing strangely in the ultra-violet light. the pool
     player is in the b.g. other vampires, dressed in black, eyes
     cold as ice, stare up at the tv.

                             vampire #1
               goddamn fool's going to bring back
               the inquisition.

                             vampire #2
               i say we kill him, before this
               gets out of hand. bleed him dry.

                             vampire #1
               gotta find him first. elusive
               bloke. never know where he's
               going to turn up.

                             vampire #2
               well we know one place he's
               definitely going to be...

     next to him sits a female vampire, evian bottle in hand.

                              vampire #1
               when i was in manchester, the coven
               there was saying exactly the same
               thing. that we should nail him at
               the concert...

                             female vampire #1
               i don't know, if he's as old as
               they say, he's gotta be pretty
               strong... if you came within a
               mile of him, he'd eat you alive.

     she brings her evian bottle to her lips.   drinks heartily.
     the liquid inside glistens deep red.

                             vampire #1
               yes. well let's see how he
               handles a thousand of us at once.

     crack -- the pool player sinks the last ball on the pool
     table. the tv suddenly explodes.

                                          (continued)

                                                            12.

      back to lestat on huge video screen

      he smiles at the journalists.

                                 lestat
                   see you all in death valley.

      click.   the screen goes black.


24    close on lestat                                             24

      in the flesh.    reveal he is...
