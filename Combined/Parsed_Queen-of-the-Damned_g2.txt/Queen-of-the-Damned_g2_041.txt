74   ext. alley - night                                            74

     jesse hurries up the alley. breaks into a run. but the
     three punk vampires from the bar have somehow gotten
     outside. they land in front of her, beside her, behind
     her. heart racing, she shakes with fear. they close in,
     smiling.

                          punk vampire #3
                  now this isn't gonna hurt.    you
                  might even enjoy it...

     he runs his hand up and down her body. jesse starts to
     shake. she breaks out in a cold sweat. the others grin.
     he picks her up by the throat. her legs flail in the
     air...

     suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. jesse
     hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. she gasps for
     air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley
     by an invisible force. jesse alone, turns, still woozy.
     finds herself staring at...

     lestat...

     jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned.

     he drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness
     of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks,
     her pulsing jugular.

                                               (continued)

                                                             48.

     jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to
     gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.
     they gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.

                          jesse
                  you saved me.

                                lestat
                  perhaps... so you know marius...

     jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the punk
     vampires -- lestat's journal sticks out. she glances at
     lestat. he mustn't see it. she steps away, tries to
     distract him.

                          jesse
                  i know a lot of things.

     he gazes at her. moves closer, breathing her in, making
     her flustered. he smiles.

                          lestat
                  not how to stay alive apparently.

                          jesse
                  well i guess we've got that in
                  common. although i think i'm a
                  little ahead in the race here.

                          lestat
                         (a beat, surprised
                          at her brazenness)
                  well, i can fix that.

     he circles her. jesse is shaking, terrified. enjoying
     the game, lestat smiles, moves closer. but jesse suddenly
     blurts out.

                          jesse
                  'mine eyes dazzle, she died so
                  young.' it's about the girl with
                  the violin, isn't it?

     that stops lestat. he gazes at jesse, surprised.
     recovers his composure. stares at her intensely,
     regarding her anew.

                               lestat
                  is it? and what else do you think
                  you know?

                                               (continued)

                                                           49.

                                jesse
                         (desperate,
                          stalling)
                  i... i think you're a lot like
                  marius, lestat.

                                 lestat
                          (staring into her
                           eyes, probing)
                  am i?   tell me all about it.

                                jesse
                  you're... you're both artists.   he's
                  a painter. you're a singer...

     as she speaks, lestat guides jesse over to a pile of
     crates. she stares at some beer bottles shattered on
     the top of one. he guides her hand downward, closer to
     the shattered glass.

                                 lestat
                  is that so?   what i do is art, is
                  it?

                                jesse
                  yes... from nothing... you try to
                  create... something beautiful...
                         (shaking now as her
                          hand gets closer
                          and closer)
                  ... out of the... the cold, dark
                  wasteland of eternity...

     he stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes
     her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel. she
     gasps with pain...

     lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear,
     glistening on jesse's finger...

                                lestat
                         (softly)
                  something beautiful...

                                jesse
                         (quickly)
                  but... but marius isn't a rebel.
                  you're different in that way. you
                  don't want to hide, follow the
                  laws, concealed in the shadows
                  like some insect. you... you
                  still want to walk with the
                  living, don't you, lestat?

                                             (continued)

                                                                   50.

     he stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding
     finger toward his mouth.

                                lestat
                  well, i'm not hiding now, am i?

     as her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his
     mouth...

                                jesse
                  no, but the only time you're not
                  really alone is when you kill...
                  but, lestat, you can't help it...
                  it's not your fault... he made
                  you this way...

                                  lestat
                           (with her blood on
                            his lips, shakes
                            his head)
                  ah.    poor, poor me...

     as he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth.

     their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy
     cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her
     remarkable, if foolhardy daring. her eyes gazing
     straight into his...

     he brings her bleeding finger into his mouth.       she may
     swoon.

     lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her
     fragility a brief second, listening to her blood.
     there's something there that surprises him as he gazes
     at this mortal girl. he feels something. desire...

     then her blood speaks to him as lestat's eyes fall on her
     rucksack. he sees the journal. it all falls into place.

     lestat's lip curls in anger. he shoves jesse away.
     wipes his mouth. the mood suddenly changes.

                                lestat
                  well, talamascan, you're certainly
                  a very clever librarian, aren't
                  you?

     she stares at him, found out. he turns from her,
     laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make jesse
     think all's well.

                                                (continued)

                                                               51.

                                lestat
                         (shaking his head)
                  how sad, you people always trying
                  to know the unknowable... so, was
                  it a good read? my diary.

     jesse slowly nods, admitting to all.    he shakes his head.

                                lestat
                  talamasca's been following me for
                  years. i've never known one to be
                  so brave. or is it just foolish?

                                jesse
                  i... i'm only an apprentice.

     he waves her off, dismissive.

                                lestat
                  go. i'm through with you. your
                  kind never satisfies my thirst.

     he turns, walks away. jesse lets out a sigh of relief,
     then stares after him. she hesitates, then suddenly
     calls out:

                                jesse
                  does anything, lestat?

     a pause in his gait. but he keeps walking away.       jesse
     hesitates again, but still calls out.

                                jesse
                  i mean, what's the point of coming
                  into the light if not to have
                  someone really know you?

     but he keeps going.    she takes one last chance --

                                jesse
                  you want the world to see you're
                  real, don't you, lestat? don't
                  you? well, here i am!

     suddenly lestat spins. stares at the fragile mortal girl
     risking everything. flash. jesse gasps.

     he now stands right before her. he grabs her, pulls her
     to him close, tight, hard. he could just snap her neck
     and be done with it.

                                            (continued)

                                                                52.

                                lestat
                  you better just stick to your
                  books, talamascan. 'cause you
                  have it all wrong. i love all
                  this. i delight in it. the
                  dark, dreary world i went to
                  sleep in has burnt itself out and
                  been replaced by the 20th century
                  -- can you imagine my joy at
                  waking up to discover such a
                  world? it has outdistanced my
                  wildest dreams of it. i scream of
                  good and evil, and mortals stand
                  and cheer. i adore being back in
                  action... every moment, every
                  single drop of it! now consider
                  yourself exceedingly lucky and go!

     he pushes her away.       she gasps, humbled by his physical
     power.

     she retrieves her rucksack. starts away. as she
     reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath,
     turns back, daring everything.

                                   jesse
                  lestat!

     he turns back, stares at her, astonished.

                                jesse
                  there's something you left out of
                  your diary.

                                   lestat
                            (amazed)
                  what?

                                jesse
                         (stares right into
                          his eyes)
                  you kept her violin, didn't you?

     a beat, then lestat shakes his head, laughs at the
     absurdity of what she's saying. but jesse is undaunted.

                                jesse
                  hey, it's okay. i understand...
                         (softly)
                  after all, it's only human.

                                               (continued)

     that stops him. their eyes bore into each other again.
     electric. then lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound
     filling the alley. lestat lunges, fangs bared. jesse
     screams. turns. runs. finds herself --
