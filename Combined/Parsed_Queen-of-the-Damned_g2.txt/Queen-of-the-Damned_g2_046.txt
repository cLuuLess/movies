     close on jesse, her face bright, walking quietly, talking
     intensely on a cell phone.

               you're right, david. the journal
               has everything in it.

               scientific significance.

               concert.

                        talbot (v.o.)
               what?   you are not! i forbid it.

                       jesse

               look i'm sorry. but i... i have
               to see what's out there with my
               own eyes. i'm onto something. i
               just don't know what yet... i have
