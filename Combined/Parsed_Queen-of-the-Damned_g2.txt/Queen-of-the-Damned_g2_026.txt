      two sound engineers work the board.

                           sound engineer #1
                   when's the concert?

                           sound engineer #2

                           sound engineer #1
                   these guys are gonna kill.

      behind them, roger sits pensively watching.
      surreptitiously, he glances down at a book on his lap --
      its title vampires -- the occult truth. he talks on a
      phone.

                                  roger
                   yeah, phil. we'll need a limo
                   from the airport. i don't know
                   which airfield yet... i don't know
                   the arrival time either.

                          roger (cont'd)
                         (sighs)

                  plane... nope, i'll tell the
                  driver where he's taking us... hey

                  up address in london?... forget
                  it... you'd never find this place.

     shaking his head, phil glances down at his vampire book.
     looking back up he see lestat now staring at him
     intensely while he sings.

                                roger

                  shy.
