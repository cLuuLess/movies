126   ext. hollywood sign - night                                    126

      marius stands in the hills by the hollywood sign, gazing
      down, his brow furrowed, at lestat's fortress-like
      mansion hidden in the canyon below. the wind blows the
      trees, bushes. marius turns, uneasy, sensing something,
      peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign.
      marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.

      it is mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.

                        mael
                marius, you've broken your oath.
                you were to watch over akasha
                and khayman. you are a great
                disappointment to me.

      marius looks up to see all the ancients now stepping
      from the shadows. khayman, the desert vampire, in
      egyptian dress along with pandora, the dark-haired
      beauty in her sari, armand, the boy sage, in his
      mesopotamian robes. last, maharet steps from her
      grand door. she is beautiful with long red hair,
      alabaster skin.

                        marius
                pandora, armand, it's been a long
                time. khayman, maharet, to what do
                i owe this honor?

                        khayman
                you have been summoned because of
                your errant child...

      khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the
      distance at lestat's house.

                             pandora
                   (giving deep,
                    sexy laugh)
                he's quite the devil, isn't he?

                        armand
                his music mocks us, pandora!

                        pandora
                his music moves my blood.

                         armand
                keep your amorous thoughts to
                yourself. his music is a threat
                to all vampires. we will let the
                covens dismember him at his
                concert.

                                            (continued)

                                                            78.

                            mael
                   yes.   it will set an example.

                            marius
                   i don't see how this solves
                   things. this isn't thought
                   through.

                           khayman
                   marius, we understand your
                   affection for lestat, but your
                   duty is to us!

      he gazes again down at lestat's house with a threatening
      glance. turns to marius with a look of warning.

                                 khayman
                   we could always get rid of him
                   right now.

                                mael
                   no. we will contact the covens.
                   let them know we condone the
                   slaying. it will be better for
                   all to see.

      marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at mael.
      maharet steps up.

                           maharet
                   wait. never mind lestat!   we
                   have greater problems...

                           marius
                          (stepping up)
                   maharet is right. it is akasha
                   we face now.

                           pandora
                      (joyous)
                   is it true, maharet?   has our
                   queen really risen!

                           maharet
                   don't be so happy, pandora. i
                   knew akasha when she walked this
                   earth. i was her slave. i am now
                   her enemy. i know what she is
                   capable of.

                                              (continued)

                                                             79.

                           armand
                   yes. we've all felt her presence,
                   even as she hides from us.
                      (as others nod,
                       acknowledging the
                       truth of this)
                   what does she want now?

                           maharet
                   she knows only one thing. taking
                   pleasure in destroying life. she
                   is already killing the young ones
                   to build her strength.

                           marius
                   she's sucked the life out of her
                   king like a praying mantis. i
                   sense she is getting closer.

                           maharet
                   she has come to destroy lestat,
                   but he will only whet her thirst
                   more...

      the ancients look to each other, taking this in.
      pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.

                           maharet
                   if we act together, we have a
                   chance to destroy her.

      they all gaze at maharet, astonished.

                           maharet
                   yes! we must destroy her
                   immediately! if she is not
                   stopped, i'm afraid of what will
                   happen to the entire mortal world.

                           mael
                   but can she be destroyed? i am
                   left to bear the scars of the last
                   attempt on her life. she was
                   dragged into the sun. she
                   survived. but we almost didn't...

      removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face.   they
      all stare at him.

                            marius
                   what happens to our queen happens
                   to us. if akasha dies, we die
                   as well.

                                              (continued)

                                                               80.

126   continued:    (3)                                              126

                           maharet
                   then so be it! we must take that
                   chance.

      she gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her
      words sink in.

                           maharet
                   we must destroy akasha. for the
                   sake of humanity! we must find
                   her. now!

                           armand
                   but perhaps she has come to kill
                   lestat and then will go back to her
                   slumber. that is our only hope.

                           pandora
                      (eager)
                   yes. that's right. she and the
                   covens will take care of that
                   brat. we must go to the concert
                   and pay our respects to our great
                   queen.

                           maharet
                   how? with your own throat!
                   you've all been asleep too long!
                   you're still dreaming.

      marius steps up beside maharet.

                           marius
                   maharet speaks the truth.   it is
                   our only hope.

      marius then goes and stands beside maharet and khayman.
      the others gaze at the three standing together now.

                           mael
                   no. armand is right. we will go
                   to the concert and first see what
                   she does. there may be no need
                   for action.

      pandora and armand nod their assent. the two groups face
      each other. maharet gazes at their faces, spits out
      the words.

                                               (continued)

                                                              81.

126   continued:    (4)                                             126

                           maharet
                   then you go to the concert and you
                   shall see!
                          (shakes her head)
                   and i thought the ancients became
                   wise with their years.

      as we remain on the ancient ones, akasha's heartbeat
      creeps back in over... marius gazes again down at
      lestat's house, anguish on his face.
