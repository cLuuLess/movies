95   ext. marius's villa/beach - night                              95

     lestat runs down the beach, the sand showing no
     footprints.

                       lestat (v.o.)
               many times since, i have called to
               marius. i howled into the night
               in loneliness and pain.

     lestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair,
     grief. he disappears off into the night.

                       lestat (v.o.)
               but there was no answer -- just
               the endless procession of days,
               months, years... my teacher left
               me to my darkest lesson -- that in
               the end, we are alone.

     lestat looks up from feeding on a mortal. wipes the
     blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night.

                                                               66.
