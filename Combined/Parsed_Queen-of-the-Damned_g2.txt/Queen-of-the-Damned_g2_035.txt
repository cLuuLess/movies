56   ext. island's south shore - night                              56

     marius kneels over the body of the father on the island's
     deserted shoreline. tosses him in a boat. lestat gazes
     at the lifeless body of the girl. marius turns to
     lestat, furious.

                       marius
               i will not have you put everything
               at risk! you will mind our laws!

     picking up lestat's victim, marius tosses her into the
     boat as well.

                       marius
               we remain in the shadows.   to do
               otherwise is a road to
               destruction...

     marius turns to lestat, who stands in silence, gazing at
     the girl and her father.

                       marius
                  (quietly)
               i see you still have a few
               lingering mortal emotions. they
               will serve you no good, lestat.

     lestat turns to marius, shaking his head, speaks in a
     horrified whisper...

                       lestat
               my god, what have you done to me?

     lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and
     her father, his face filled with pain, enormous sadness.

                             lestat
                      (whisper)
               she's just a child... forgive me.
