62   int. club - night                                              62

     the music is part blues, part kurt weil, part gothic,
     dark and ominous as if the pianist knew exactly the sort
     of trouble jesse was in. the bar is comprised of
     elaborately-carved chinese dragons, a tv mounted
     incongruously in the corner showing a silent vampire
     lestat video.

     couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a
     music box. another couple is necking hot and heavy in
     the corner. jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire
     coven. many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt.
     their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light. jesse
     moves through the tables, passing a mortal yuppie-type
     sitting with a vampire girl he's obviously just met that
     night.

                          yuppie
                  wow. this is the coolest after
                  hours club ever. you sure you
                  don't want a drink?

                          vampire girl
                  soon.

     the vampire girl smiles, glances up at jesse as she
     passes. jesse looks away quickly, moves on... the
     pianist watches as she passes by. the couple necking in
     the corner begins to get even more aroused. a mortal
     girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses
     her shoulder, her throat...


63   unknown pov                                                    63

     unaware that she is being watched, jesse continues her
     circuit.


64   back to scene                                                  64

     as jesse approaches the bar where three punk vampires
     slouch, looking up at lestat on the video.

                                                           44.

65   unknown pov                                                 65

     we watch the punk vampires and hear every word they say
     as the other sounds fade away.

                       punk vampire #1
               every coven's going...


66   reverse angle                                               66

     reveal unknown pov. a vampire, face hidden behind a
     hood, seems extremely interested in what the punk
     vampires are saying.


67   back to punk vampires                                       67

     a young girl dressed in goth gear sits down at the bar.
     punk vampire #1 turns and smiles insincerely at her as
     she stares up at lestat on the tv. getting a sudden
     chill, the goth girl takes her drink and moves back into
     the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous
     eyes.


68   jesse                                                       68

     reaches the punk vampires. they fall silent as she
     pauses at the bar. she turns, stares at the necking
     couple...


69   jesse's pov                                                 69

     ... a brief glimpse of the tiny trickle of blood on the
     mortal girl's neck as she swoons... an even briefer flash
     as her vampire lover comes up for air, his lips and teeth
     shiny with blood...


70   jesse                                                       70

     stares, horrified.


71   back to scene                                               71

                       punk vampire #1 (o.s.)
               come here often?

     jesse turns to see punk vampire #1 leaning towards her.

                       jesse
               sure, all the time.

                                          (continued)

                                                               45.

71   continued:                                                      71

     the punk vampire pulls down her collar.

                          punk vampire #1
                  don't see any marks.

                          jesse
                  you haven't seen the rest of my
                  body.

                          punk vampire #2
                  is that an invitation?

     jesse finds herself surrounded by the three vampires.
     she shakes her head, too frightened to get out a
     response.

                          punk vampire #3
                  so, where's your host?

                          jesse
                  my host... oh he's here somewhere.

     she peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the
     door...

     finds herself blocked by punk vampire #2.

                          punk vampire #2
                  your host. what's his name?

     jesse looks around, trying not to panic. pale faces,
     pale eyes stare at her. a long, terrible pause...
     suddenly --

                          jesse
                  marius...


72   hooded figure                                                   72

     leans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal,
     fascinated.


73   back to scene                                                   73

                           punk vampire #1
                  sorry.   don't know the guy.

     the punk vampires laugh.     jesse desperately tries to
     cover her terror.

                                             (continued)

                                                          46.

73   continued:                                                 73

                          jesse
                  marius has the blood of the
                  ancients flowing in his veins.

                          punk vampire #2
                  there aren't any ancients left.
                  they all turned to dust...

                          jesse
                  that's a myth. marius is around
                  here somewhere...

     jesse again heads for the door. but punk vampire #1 has
     appeared in front of her. she stares at him, terrified.

                          jesse
                  you... you really should meet him.

                          punk vampire #1
                  and why is that?

     jesse watches the other punk vampires slowly begin to
     close in on her. as she speaks, she slowly edges to the
     door...

                          jesse
                  because... because... he's wise, a
                  philosopher... he asks the big
                  questions. like how are you going
                  to get through eternity? it's
                  easier for us mortals. life is
                  brief, but for you...

     she inches toward the door, desperately stalling. their
     white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. she
     struggles to get the words out...

                          jesse
                  i mean... what can you really do
                  with immortality besides just slip
                  from one day to the next, trapped
                  in a void of meaninglessness,
                  relieved only by your next victim?
                  how do you not give in to despair
                  and just wither away from boredom,
                  hopelessness?

     the punk vampires pause, staring at her, as her words
     sink in. the hooded figure leans forward revealing his
     face...

     it is lestat. he stares at jesse, amazed. jesse glances
     desperately at the door. it's just a few feet away now.

                                            (continued)

                                                             47.

73   continued:    (2)                                             73

                          jesse
                  you know, it's like they say --
                  the more things change, the more
                  they stay the same. for you
                  that's forever, right?

     all around her, vampires are turning to look. the punk
     vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. jesse is now
     inches from the door. she can barely breathe. punk
     vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning
     to anger.

                          punk vampire #1
                  you know, you're really a
                  downer...

     he bares his fangs. jesse bolts out the door... pan
     across vampire faces staring after jesse to lestat
     who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. he watches the
     punk vampires head after jesse.

                                               cut to:
