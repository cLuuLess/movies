182   int. maharet desert mansion - night                          182

      mael leads jesse down the hall. she stares ahead at what
      looks like statues standing in the shadows. her eyes
      widen as the statues come to life: armand, pandora,
      khayman, marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered
      before maharet's "great family tree." camera sweeps
      over the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch
      down the stone wall -- across the floor, filling room
      after room. the ancients all stare, deeply moved.
      maharet turns to them.

                           maharet
                   we see now what akasha means to
                   do. rule as queen again.
                      (pointing to the
                       great family)
                   this is why we must fight akasha!

      maharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the
      immortals.

                                                            109.

                           maharet
                   for the sake of all mortals. she
                   must be stopped, or the mortal
                   world will end.

      the ancients fall silent as they take this in. they gaze
      again at maharet's great family, humbled for a moment by
      her life's passion.

                           mael
                   but is there a way?   we don't
                   know.

                           khayman
                   when she opens herself to give her
                   blood, she is vulnerable.

                           marius
                   then we weaken her. drain her of
                   almost all her blood, but leave
                   her just one drop.

                           maharet
                   we can't take that chance.    we
                   must finish her.

                           armand
                   if she dies, we all die.

                            pandora
                   we're damned no matter what
                   happens.

                              maharet
                   perhaps.

      maharet gazes at them, her mind working... pandora,
      khayman, mael gaze at each other, still uncertain.

                           jesse
                   and what about lestat?

                           maharet
                   lestat has joined with akasha. he
                   is lost to us now. he is never
                   coming back.

                           jesse
                   i don't believe that.

      beaming with a possessed look, his eyes brimming with
      visions.

      lestat opens his eyes and sees an island approaching.   in
      the distance lights sparkle as an enormous plantation
      villa is revealed, nestled into the far shore.
