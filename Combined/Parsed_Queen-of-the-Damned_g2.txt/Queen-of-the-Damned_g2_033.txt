54   ext. beach - night                                             54

     a million stars...

                          lestat (v.o.)
                  i impressed my maker with my
                  thirst for things. he set out to
                  educate me in the unknown. taught
                  me all about the world, its hidden
                  history... and about myself.

     tilt down to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as
     lestat bites into his throat. marius watches as the
     fisherman's body relaxes. he pulls lestat away.

                                             (continued)

                                                            37.

                          marius
                  that's enough, my son... when you
                  feed, you must hold back from the
                  moment of death. you must never
                  take the last drop, or it will
                  draw you in and you will die...

     the fisherman is moaning. looking down at the suffering
     victim, marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into
     a boat. he picks up an oar, and with vampire strength,
     drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat.
     water starts bubbling in.

                          marius
                  remember, there is wisdom in the
                  flesh, lestat. a man wears his
                  history on his skin...

     marius feels lestat's gaze, turns to him.

                          marius
                  i'm talking about humanity.

     as lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom
     of the boat...

                                     lestat
                  humanity?
                     (snort)
                  we're murderers.

                          marius
                  we're more than that. their blood
                  that we take into us carries with
                  it life... their life, their
                  knowledge, their complexity.
                  appreciate your prey, lestat.

     marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire
     strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.
