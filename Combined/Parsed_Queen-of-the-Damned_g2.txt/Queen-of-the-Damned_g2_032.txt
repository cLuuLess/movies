51   int. villa bedroom - night                                     51

     a great round room encircled with candles, their
     reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving
     back the outside storm. a huge antique bed sits in the
     room's center, and on it... lestat lays feverish and
     fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. his neck
     wears a swollen bite. another flash of lightning
     suddenly jolts him awake. his hands feel the inflamed
     wound as he sees...

     an indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red
     velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. an
     easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting.
     lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a
     nearby louis iv chair. he makes for a door when...

     lestat suddenly stops. he looks back to see the painting
     that stands on the easel. it's a portrait of himself in
     ancient roman garb, like the god mars, complete with his
     blond hair and fiery blue eyes. unable to help himself,
     he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his
     own image, when suddenly...

     the sleeping man leaps up, grabs   lestat unmercifully and
     again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck.
     lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match
     as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. finally...

     the strange man lifts himself up from lestat's neck to
     reveal the face of the vampire marius, the mysterious
     figure. wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's
     cloth --

                            marius
                  lestat.    welcome.

     weakened and helpless, lestat drags himself back across
     the floor in terror.

                                            (continued)

                                                            34.

                          lestat
                  who are you? do i know you?

                          marius
                  i'm unknowable by nature.

     marius advances again on the young man...

                          marius
                  but you may call me marius.

     as lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away.

                          lestat
                  i'm the lord of a great manor.
                  they'll send an army of men to
                  look for me.

                          marius
                  i doubt they'll find you,
                  lord de lioncourt. you're a long
                  way from home...

     his strength leaving him, lestat slumps flat on the
     floor.

                          marius
                  you're weak... near passing. i
                  can barely hear your heartbeat.

                          lestat
                  i'll kill you!

     marius smiles, impressed.

                          marius
                  you really do fear nothing. it is
                  why i chose you. because you
                  think things are possible which
                  aren't possible...

     lestat stares at him, his eyes wide.

                          lestat
                  chose me? for what?

                          marius
                  my companion. someone to share my
                  burden.

     bending down, he gazes at lestat.

                          marius
                  you've lost a great deal of blood.

                                              (continued)

                                                              35.

51   continued:    (2)                                              51

                          lestat
                     (near tears)
                  i'm dying.

     suddenly marius draws a knife from a roman sheath on his
     belt. with the last of his strength, lestat grabs his
     attacker's wrist.

                          marius
                  then drink.

     guiding lestat's hand with the knife, marius smiles and
     cuts his own arm, opening his veins. lestat stares in
     true terror as marius lets his blood drip onto lestat's
     lip. lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his
     mouth...

                          marius
                  good, is it not?

     and indeed... it does taste good. that's the new terror
     that's gripping him. he crosses himself and stares up
     into marius's gentle eyes. marius bends down, cups
     lestat's chin.

                          marius
                  drink and live. you've been brave
                  enough for one night, my son.

     marius brings his open vein to lestat's lips. lestat
     hesitates, but then suddenly... feeds hungrily as
     marius's face fills with the bond. he slowly sinks
     down to his knees as lestat feeds and feeds. as
     lestat drinks, a barrage of images flood into him...


52   images                                                         52

     of marius's life through the ages... impressionistic,
     subliminal burst of images, color... the glory days of
     the roman empire to this very moment flash by...


53   back to lestat                                                 53

     he keeps drinking from the vampire marius who gasps with
     the creation of his child.

                          marius
                  drink... drink and learn.

     lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he
     draws the "life" into him with full force, as... marius
     begins to weaken, himself.

                                              (continued)

                                                              36.

53   continued:                                                     53

                          marius
                  there... there... that will do.

     but lestat keeps on feeding hungrily.

                          marius
                  no... no more.   lestat, no more!

     with one great move, marius pulls lestat off his arm and
     tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. marius
     reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as
     lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the
     rush.

     slowly, lestat starts to feel something. pain begins
     travelling through his body, consuming him until he
     screams. marius crosses to lestat convulsing on the
     floor. he kneels and gently wipes his brow. lestat's
     body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...

                          marius
                  don't be afraid, it's only your
                  body that dies...

     wiping his brow as he dies...

     then, lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins
     to laugh almost drunkenly. raising his head, his
     metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes
     fill with a new kind of power.

                          lestat
                  more!

     lestat smiles with red glistening lips.     a beat on marius
     as he slowly smiles, too.
