40	int. hotel - karla and tyrell's room - day

	we move into the hotel room and gradually reveal four sets of feet at
	the end of one bed. they are crammed into a king-size bed together.

	julie is awake. she gets out of bed and moves toward the window.

	it's raining outside. the wind is blowing. the storm has arrived.

	karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest. the hand belongs to will.
	she pinches the hand. will starts.

	tyrell kicks his feet around, trying to get some room.

					tyrell
			this ain't the romantic weekend i
			had in mind.

	karla kisses tyrell on the cheek.

					karla
				(to julie)
			you get any sleep at all?

					julie
			some.

	tyrell glares at julie by the window. sees the incredible rain.

					tyrell
			oh, look. another day in paradise
			with julie-your-tour-director...miss
			psychotic episode.

					karla
			hey --

					tyrell
				(calling to julie)
			see any dead bodies out there? any
			fresh kill? how 'bout freddy, jason?

	julie ignores him, staring out the window.

					will
			leave her alone.

	angry at her boyfriend, karla gets out of bed and joins julie.

					tyrell
			i'm just saying what all of you are
			thinking. it's bad enough gettin'
			rained out without having to hold
			her hand the whole time.

					will
			you don't have to be a jerk.

	karla pulls julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind
	everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies.

					julie
			it's okay...he doesn't believe me.
			that's his right. i'm starting to
			think i'm crazy, too.

					karla
			hey, slow down, turn off the little
			motor up in there...what do you say
			we go to the gym and work off a
			little stress?

	julie doesn't look to enthusiastic.
