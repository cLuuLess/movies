7	int. the club - night

	it's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud music, a dance floor, and
	rivers of cheap booze.

	at the bar

	julie sits next to karla as she waits for her drink order.

	a handsome young man slides in front of them. this is tyrell martin,
	23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.

					tyrell
			you know what i want to do to you
			...right now, don't you? there's
			gotta be somewhere we can be alone.

					karla
				(playful)
			i don't think so. it's pretty
			crowded.

					tyrell
			just for a minute, baby. i got
			something i wanna tell you.

	he's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.

					karla
				(teasing)
			if you can say all you gotta say
			in a minute then i don't wanna hear
			it.

					tyrell
			i'll talk real slow.

	he's kissing her ear. she starts to giggle.

	the bartender sets down drinks on karla's tray.

					karla
				(re: julie)
			ask her to dance.

	tyrell hesitates.

					karla (cont'd)
			go on.

	karla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. tyrell turns to
	julie.

					tyrell
			you're the most beautiful woman
			in the bar tonight, jules.

					julie
			tyrell, you are an unstoppable
			force of nature.

					tyrell
			that's right. it's how the species
			survives. you'll never convince me
			otherwise.
				(beat)
			wanna dance?

	karla passes by --

					karla
			say yes.

					julie
			no.

					karla
			no means yes.

					julie
			tyrell, i appreciate it, but have
			you seen my people dance? we make
			the mouth face, we move the
			fingers --

					tyrell
				(heading for the floor)
			worse comes to worse, you can stand
			there and watch me.

					karla
			come on, i'll take a break and
			we'll all dance.

7a	int. the club - dance floor - night

	is packed and thumping. karla is dancing her way through the crowd.
	tyrell and julie follow behind her.

	karla sees will. he's dressed up and nervous. she smiles.

					karla (cont'd)
			whaddayou know? will benson lookin'
			fine.

					julie
				(suspicious, but
				having fun)
			karla! did you tell him i'd be here?

					karla
			nope. i told him that you
			absolutely, positively would not be
			here at this bar between ten o'clock
			and eleven o'clock tonight. and then
			he came anyway.

					will
				(shy to a fault)
			this was not my idea.

					julie
			what?

					will
			i said, this...do you want a drink?

	will looks down at his feet. he and julie stand there not quite
	knowing what to do.

					tyrell
			where i come from, you want to
			snatch the goodies, you got to at
			least talk to them first.

	tyrell and karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving will and julie
	alone. they look at each other. they look at everyone dancing.

					will
			how about a drink?

	will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. julie seems to be
	relaxing, having a good time. then, she looks up into the balcony and
	sees, in a strobe light's flash --

	someone in a slicker

	watching her intently. she squints for a better look, but he's gone.

					will
				(yelling over the din)
			you okay?

	she's chalk white and crestfallen. her whole affect is "will i ever
	have a normal time?" she drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.

					will (cont'd)
			hey julie?

	will catches karla and tyrell's eyes. they're worried.

7b	int. the club - staircase - night

	julie catches another glimps of the slicker.

	she pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs.

7c	int. the club - balcony - night

	julie looks all around -- finally spotting the man in the slicker from
	behind, making his way to the other side.

	he slices through a crowd of students, and julie keeps following. he
	turns down a service corridor.

	julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.

	she catches him at the end of the corridor. she reaches out and grabs
	the stranger's arm.

					julie
			ben...

	the stranger turns around. it's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl
	raincoat and hat. she's shaken.

					slicker guy
			hye, baby. you following me up
			here?
				(a come-on)
			well, all right.

	julie turns away and hurries down the hallway. todd follows, but his
	figure quickly fades.
