31	ext. pool/jacuzzi - night

	bubbles of a different kind. the jacuzzi sits in an enclosure at the
	shallow end of the swimming pool.

	and enjoying its warmth, karla and tyrell are liplocked in the
	churning tub. music plays on the boombox beside them.

	the tempurature rises and ty's hands begin to wander. still clad in
	her cute bikini, karla pulls away --

					karla
			you sure you didn't pick up my hair
			tie?

					tyrell
				(rubbing his bald head)
			hello?

					karla
			okay, i just didn't wanna get my
			hair wet.

					tyrell
			baby, i finally got you alone in this
			jacuzzi and i don't wanna be discussin'
			hair care.

	she splashes him.

					karla
			don't you get feisty...

	tyrell moves in for the kill. he won't take no for an answer.

					tyrell
			too late for that. we're miles from
			anywhere, baby. no one's gonna hear
			you scream.

	he goes in for a serious kiss. things start to heat up --

					karla
			i used to be a lifeguard...i'd hate to
			have to blow my whistle.

					tyrell
				(playful)
			i'd hate for you to have to blow...your
			whistle.

	tyrell is done talking. he pulls her over to him and the moment
	becomes more passionate.

	karla opens her eyes in time to see --

	titus

	surface in the pool next to them.

	karla screams. and not just because it was a surprise. titus looks
	even uglier when he's wet.

	titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking philly blunt on the end of
	his tounge.

					titus
			no water sports after midnight. hotel
			policy.

	titus eyes karla in the jacuzzi. tyrell moves protectively in front of
	her.

					tyrell
			what's the policy on burnin' herb?

					titus
			we got one for that, too. it's don't
			try until you buy.
				(beat)
			you don't buy any, you don't get any.

	titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into
	his mouth, and swims off. tyrell is angry, but karla pulls him back.

	a dejected will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm.
	tyrell sees him coming.

					tyrell
			there's ten people on this whole island
			and they're all gonna end up in this
			jacuzzi with us.

					will
				(getting in)
			how's the water?

					tyrell
			crowded.

					karla
			ty!

	will slips into the water ignoring tyrell's look.

					will
			ahh, that feels great.

					karla
				(considerate)
			how's julie?

					will
			alone. in the room.
				(to karla)
			got any advise?

					tyrell
				(annoyed)
			yeah. find another jacuzzi.

	karla shoots tyrell a look.

					karla
				(to will)
			your not out yet, slugger. you gotta
			just get back up there and keep
			swingin'.

	in the empty night lobby, behind the desk
