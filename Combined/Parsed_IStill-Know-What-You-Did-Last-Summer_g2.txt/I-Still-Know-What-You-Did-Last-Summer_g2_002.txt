1	int. boston - old north church - day

	the setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. holy
	images of stained glass and lead.

	footsteps echo across the marble floor.

	reveal - julie james

	a little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. but
	she's all alone in the house of the lord.

	and those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden
	still rests upon her soul.

	she reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained
	confessional booth.
