19	ext. resort dock - day

	the ferry pulls in to a canopied dock. a white-sand beach stretches in
	every direction. beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the
	world.

	tyrell stamps his feet on the dock.

					tyrell
			i feel like i'm still on that thing.

	a dockhand, derrick, glides past him toward the ladies.

					derrick
			that way for a complimentary planter's
			punch to get you readjusted.

					tyrell
				(mile-wide smile)
			i can get used to this.

	derrick reaches for julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the
	process.

					derrick
			welcome, fair princess, to tower bay.
				(a wink)
			i'm derrick. at your service for the
			duration of your stay.

	julie smiles politely. will gently nudges her on. they walk away.

					paulsen
				(to derrick, mocking)
			i'm at your service, princess.

					derrick
				(shrugs)
			season's over old man. so i gotta
			work fast.

					paulsen
			if marine radio's right about the
			weather, you're already out of time.

	he hangs a sign at the end of the gangplank. it reads: last departing
	ferry -- line forms here.

	our guys are already at the end of the dock.
