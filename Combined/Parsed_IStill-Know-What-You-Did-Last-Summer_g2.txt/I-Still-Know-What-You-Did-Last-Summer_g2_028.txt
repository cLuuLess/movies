29	int. hotel - karla and tyrell's room - night

	karla bounces playfully on their big bed as tyrell crosses toward the
	windows.

					karla
			tha's it.
				(bounce)
			i've decided.
				(bounce)
			i'm changing my major to finance.
				(bounce)
			and going to wall street.

					tyrell
			why?

					karla
			'cause that's the only way i'm ever
			gonna be able to afford a big bed like
			this.

	she falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a
	long mirror hanging right over the bed. tyrell loves this and quickly
	moves beside her in the bed. she lets him get real close, then she
	jumps up --

					karla (cont'd)
			jacuzzi.

	tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed.

					tyrell
			ah, baby, let's stay right here.

	karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and
	flirtatiously for tyrell.

					karla
			i spent a hundred bucks on it...even if
			it's just so you can pull it off.

	tyrell gets off the bed --

					tyrell
			i like the sound of this.
