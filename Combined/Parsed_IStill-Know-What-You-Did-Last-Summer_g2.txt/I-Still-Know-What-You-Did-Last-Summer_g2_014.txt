13	ext. julie's apartment - day

	karla exits the building. she watches julie sitting on the curb.

	a truck turns onto the street. julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not
	ray.

	karla approaches her friend.

					karla
			girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.

	julie turns.

					julie
			he's not coming. i thought he was
			just...

					karla
			julie, you left four messages...
			four.

					julie
			but, he said he'd try.

					karla
			he said he'd try. try is like maybe.
			try is nothing!

					julie
				(appoligizing for him)
			he does work hard.

					karla
			work hard, huh? he's breaking your
			heart just because he can.
				(hesitant)
			and i don't want to have to say i
			told you so...

					julie
			then, don't.

	a jeep cherokee stops, and an ebullient tyrell steps out wearing
	shorts and a hawaiian shirt.

					tyrell
			hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or
			we gonna get tropical?

	the passenger door opens and will benson steps hesitantly around the
	jeep.

					julie
			oh!

					karla
				(re: will)
			hey, sorry...
				(quick, playing it off)
			he's my friend, too. and that ticket
			is not going to waste.

	will reads julie's expression.

					will
			julie, is everything cool? karla
			said...

					karla
			i said we start having fun. and that
			means now.

	julie takes a last look up the street. she stands.

					tyrell
			is there a problem here?

					karla
			where there's a will, there's a
			way. come on.

					julie
				(deciding)
			you know what? this rocks. we're
			going to the bahamas!

	will is relieved.

					karla
				(getting into the spirit)
			we goin' bahamas, i'm ty's bahama
			mama. we goin' bahamas...

	she bops over to tyrell.
