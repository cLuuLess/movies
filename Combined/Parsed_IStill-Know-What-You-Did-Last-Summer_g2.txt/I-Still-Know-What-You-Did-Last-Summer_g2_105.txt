103	ext. wood trail - night

	will pulls julie along a muddy path in the rain. he's got her by the
	hair. she's slipping and falling.

					will
			look at the bright side, jules. we
			finally get to spend some quality
			time together.

	julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.

					julie
			why are you doing this to me?

					will
			me, me, me. it's always about you.
			i'm having bad dreams. i can't
			sleep. i'm not doing well in school.
			i'm having trouble with my boyfriend.

					julie
			i trusted you.

					will
			we had a connection, didn't we? i
			can tell you one thing, though. ray
			didn't trust me. he was right. he's
			dead, but he was right.

	they come into the orchard. they are covered in mud. julie stumbles
	again. goes to her knees. works the knife free and slashes up at will.
	she slices him across the face.

	he steps back, feels the blood.

					will (cont'd)
			what'd you have to do that for?

	there is a creepy pause. will stares at his own blood. she catches her
	breath...

	then suddenly, will knocks the knife from her hand. he lifts her by
	the hair. enraged, he puches her in the face. she goes down.
