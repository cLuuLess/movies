	int. shower

	eyes closed, julie stands with her face right under the showerhead,
	trying to relax. something softly goes thump.

	julie opens her eyes. turns off the shower. stands there, frozen,
	listening.

					julie
				(calling out)
			will...?

	no reply.

	at the bathroom doorway

	in a robe with a towel on her head, julie peeks into her room. nobody
	there. she sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.

	at the sink

	julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. she frowns.
	looks around. some of her things are missing. she peers into the
	fogged-up bathroom mirror.

	she whips the towel off her head and wipes it across the mirror,
	making the bedroom behind her visible.

	ready to spit, she looks down. and in that instant -- we see a shadowy
	figure pass behind her in the bedroom. she looks back up...and he's
	gone. julie turns on the water to rinse.

	angle on the bedroom door

	as it slowly creaks shut, the sound drowned out by the sink.
