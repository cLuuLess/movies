77	int. hotel corridor - continuous

	on the top floor, they race toward the end of a dark hallway.

	at the far end of the hall, nancy illuminates a section of the
	ceiling.

					nancy
			give me a boost up --

	julie helps nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling.

	a wooden ladder

	pulls down. nancy quickly climbs up.

	ben willis

	enters the hallway and continues toward them.

	on the ladder

	karla slips, nearly knocking julie to the floor. they both scramble
	upwards --

	ben hits the ladder --

	just as julie reaches the top rung she screams --

	ben's hook is on her foot!

	nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at ben. it hits
	him in the chest and knocks him back.

	julie makes it into the attic. they pull the ladder up behind them
	like a drawbridge.
