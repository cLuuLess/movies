44	ext. hotel - day

	will and tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps
	outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds. debris from the
	storm is scattered all around them.

					tyrell
			they're around...they just don't
			care about us 'cause we're the
			contest winners.
				(beat)
			let's go find stoner boy...make his
			lazy butt hook us up with fishing
			poles or ping-pong paddles or
			something.

					will
				(nervous)
			you know, the greenhouse effect has
			caused the gulf stream to shift and
			almost every meteorological expert
			expects a dramatic increase in
			tropical depression --

					tyrell
			hey -- shut up, okay?

	tyrell keeps walking. will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept
	vista. not much of a day for activities.

					will
				(sotto)
			i don't like to fish.

	tyrell moves across the grounds. he looks back. will is stopped in his
	tracks, looking up at --

	in the window of the bell tower --

	estes, staring down at them.

					tyrell
				(calling to will)
			you coming?

	will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...estes
	is gone.
