102	int. hotel lobby - night

	nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf. she reaches for it...
	it's a first aid kit.

	another hand

	reaches over and lands on top of her hand. she jumps and sees estes
	right behind her. karla screams.

					estes
			will...he's in on it. he's --

	suddenly estes's expression changes to surprise, and

	a spear tip

	appears in the front of his chest.

	nancy screams and looks over estes's shoulder to see

	ben willis

	standing there holding a spear gun.

	estes topples over on top of nancy, pinning her underneath his dying,
	convulsing body. nancy struggles to get loose.

					nancy
			help me.

	karla rushes to nancy. she tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free.

	the fisherman strides toward them. he raises his hook. he swings at
	karla's head.

	the hook catches

	on a beam. karla struggle with nancy.

					karla
			come on, come on.

	ben tries to free his hook hand. karla looks up at him. he calmly puts
	his foot onto estes's back and steps down with all of his weight,
	driving

	the spear tip

	deep into nancy who expires with a sigh.

					karla (cont'd)
			damn you.

	karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. he kicks out with a
	boot and sends karla fying onto

	a glass table

	in the lobby area. the table explodes. karla is finished.

	the fisherman works his hook free from the post. karla is unmoving and
	looks quite dead.
