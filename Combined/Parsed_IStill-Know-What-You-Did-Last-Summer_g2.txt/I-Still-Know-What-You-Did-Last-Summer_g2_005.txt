4	ext. campus - day

	julie explodes out of the building. hurries down a sidewalk. will
	finally catches up.

					will
			julie! wait! you okay?

					julie
			i'm fine.

					will
			you sure?

					julie
			i'm fine.

					will
			you don't seem fine.

	julie realizes this is true.

					julie
			i had another dream, will.

	will takes this seriously.

					will
			the shower again?

					julie
			it was in a church...it was so real.
			i mean, i could feel his breath on me.

					will
				(caring)
			i'm sorry.

					julie
			i thought i was over the dreams for
			good. i really did. i hadn't had one
			for months.

					will
			it just takes time, julie. it's gonna
			get better.

					julie
			it can't get worse. i mean, it's not
			like this was the first time i
			freaked out in class. i hardly ever
			get a full night's sleep, my grades
			suck, i'm this close from being thrown
			out of school.

	blam! blam! blam! explosions. julie jumps out of her skin. it's just
	students letting off firecrackers as they fly past on bicycles.

	will and julie are now thinking the same thing.

					julie
				(cont'd)
			it was one year ago...

					will
			it's...the anniversary. that's what's
			going on...take it easy on yourself.

					julie
				(weary)
			i'm trying. i really am...sometimes i
			don't even know why i came up here in
			the first place.

					will
				(cheering her up)
			to get out of southport?

					julie
				(softens)
			right. now i remember.

	he smiles at her. she smiles back. they stop in front of her apartment
	building.

					julie (cont'd)
			are you getting out of town on the
			fourth?

					will
			nah. i'll probably just be here
			studying for finals. the joys of
			summer school...
				(beat)
			are you okay?

					julie
			i'm okay.

					will
			are you sure?

	she touches his face affectionately.

					julie
			thanks for the talk, will. you're
			good to me.

	will stands there akwardly --

					will
			um...okay. bye.

	will walks away. julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --

	ray

	steps out of the shadows. julie practically faints.

					julie
			oh, my god, ray. you scared me.

	recovering, she hugs ray, genuinely glad to see him. he's a bit cold.

					ray
			i got in early. i was excited...
				(re: the receding will)
			who was that guy?

					julie
			oh, that's will. he's a friend.
			you'd like him.

					ray
			yeah.

					julie
			ray, we're just friend.

					ray
			every guy in history who tried to
			pick up a girl did the good-friend
			thing first.

					julie
			why are you being like this?

	it should be obvious ray feels insecure in the college environs, but
	they're miscommunicating.

					ray
			hey, i'm sorry. you're right. are
			you ready to go? i've got the old
			truck. you know the drill...crab
			boil at ollie's. croaker queen
			pageant...it's only small-town fun,
			but it's still nice. people really
			miss you. i miss you.

	she looks at ray, his compassionate demeanor. this is hard to say --

					julie
				(softly, but resolved)
			ray, i can't...

					ray
			can't what?

					julie
			i just feel like some part of me
			hasn't healed up enough to go back.
			like some critical piece is missing.
			please understand...

	ray is cold. this is what he's expected all along.

					ray
			i understand something.

					julie
			it's not like that. it's not you.
			it's me. my head. i want to go back.
			i want to be with you. i want to be
			fine. i want everything to be like
			it used to be.
				(beat)
			it just isn't.

	ray is hurt and confused.

					julie (cont'd)
			hey, why don't you stay up here?
			they have fireworks over the river.
			and...there's a million things to do.

					ray
			i have to work, julie. my boat's in
			southport, remember? but, i get it.
			you need your space from craokerland.
			and maybe from me, too.

	ray starts walking away.

					ray (cont'd)
			you know where to find me.

					julie
			ray? ray? at least come up for a
			while.

	ray keeps on walking.

					ray
			it's okay. i'm just gonna go.

	julie follows him out to the road. a group of laughing students block
	her way.

					julie
			ray, i'm sorry. i didn't mean...
				(to herself)
			i'm just scared...that's all.

	but ray is already gone. julie stares after him a beat, then turns
	quickly to her door. she clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the
	walk alone. she nervously pulls her keys. a can of mace dangles from
	the keychain.
