49	int. basement room - day

	karla slowly sticks her head around the corner just as the thumping
	noise sounds loundly. she reacts --

	a thumping dryer

	in a small laundry room. karla relaxes.

					karla
				(doing julie)
			gee, karla...that'll break the
			machine...

	she approaches the machine, which is rocking with the noise.

					karla (cont'd)
			damn. how many pairs you got in
			there?

	she opens the dryer door and jumps back.

	a bloody shoe

	flies out and into her arms. she looks down a beat, and screams bloody
	murder.

	a hot spray of blood gushes from the machine.

	reveal - olga's dismembered body

	tumbling inside the dryer. karla screams again. then she hears the
	sound of heavy boots coming down the hall. she runs to the door and
	locks it.

	she's trapped in a bloody basement cell. suddenly somebody pounds on
	the door. karla screams.

	she runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of
	basement windows.

	the door is hit again and again. somebody is throwing their shoulder
	against it.

	karla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on
	the panes.
