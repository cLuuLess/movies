73	int. hotel kitchen - night

	tyrell stands at the sink, where karla holds a towel full of ice to
	his head. nancy, the bartender, looks on apologetically.

					nancy
			i'm sorry, but you could've been
			the one doing all of this --

					tyrell
			and so could you -- crazy fool.

					nancy
			you stumbled into my hiding place.

					tyrell
			must have missed the sign.

					nancy
			excuse me, but this island didn't
			have a murder rate until you people
			showed up.
				(chilled)
			i've never seen a dead body before.

					julie
			get used to it.

					nancy
			who's doing this?

					tyrell
				(friendly)
			don't even get her started...it's a
			long, long story and you probably
			wouldn't believe a word of it.

	tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted. he crosses past the
	stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans.

					tyrell (cont'd)
			i mean, all i know for sure is this
			is the worst vacation of my life...
			i'm tired, and i'm hungry, and i
			personally haven't seen one damn
			psycho killer...

	thwack! a steel hook

	sinks deep into the base of tyrell's shaved skull, a look of abject
	surprise on his face.

	the women freeze as tyrell dances like a marionette before being
	hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan.

	the fisherman

	is in the vent above the stove. he stares out at them from the hood of
	his slicker.

	ben jumps from the range onto the floor. karla is in shock. julie
	yanks her and they flee.

	as she goes, julie picks up

	a loose knife

	and hides it in her back pocket.
