34	int. hotel - julie's room - night

	everyone is gathered in the center of julie's room. julie is held
	tight by will. brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation.

	brooks approaches the closet door. julie holds her breath. he throws
	it open. a long beat.

					brooks
			i don't find this at all funny.

	julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet. she can't believe her
	eyes.

	she searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her.

					julie
			there was a body! i swear it!

					will
				(delicately)
			julie, you said you were tired. waybe
			you were dreaming.

					julie
				(sharp)
			i wasn't dreaming.

					brooks
			i knew you people were goining to be
			trouble. i knew from the first time i
			laid eyes on you.

	julie grabs brooks by his robe.

					julie
			listen to me. he's here.

					brooks
			who? who is here?

	she doesn't know where to start. nancy pokes her head around the door.

					nancy
			what's going on?

					tyrell
			julie thinks there's a dead guy in the
			closet.

					nancy
			cool.

					tyrell
			the rest of us see bathrobes.

					julie
				(sharp)
			i am not crazy, tyrell. he was right
			there.

					tyrell
				(not taking it seriously)
			fine. show me the body.

	will wanders over to the closet and checks it out.

					karla
			think about this, julie. what did you
			actually see?

					julie
			the dockhand guy. hanging by his neck
			from up there.

					brooks
				(case closed)
			in the morning we'll talk to derrick, the
			"dockhand guy," and put the whole thing
			to rest.
				(looks to nancy)
			now, let's slow down on the dark and
			stormies and get some sleep.

					nancy
			don't look at me --

					julie
			i want off this island.

					brooks
				(tired)
			not possible, i'm afraid. the last ferry
			left hours ago. and we got a storm
			coming. there won't be another one for
			days.

					tyrell
			there's a storm coming?

					brooks
			'tis the season, like i told you. it's a
			big one.

	julie goes for the phone.

					julie
			then i'll call the mainland for a
			charter.

					brooks
			phones went down a few minutes ago.

	she picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand.

					julie
			it's dead.

	an exasperated brooks heads for the door.

					brooks
			duh. the next couple of days is gonna
			be rough, but we'll make it.

					karla
			what about a radio?

					brooks
			sorry. emergencies only.

					karla
			what the hell would you call this?

					brooks
			i'd call this four spoiled city kids who
			wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up
			their butts.
				(beat)
			all we can do now is batten down and ride
			it out. if things get really bad, there's
			a storm shelter.

	and brooks is gone. outside the window, it starts to rain. there's a
	clap of thunder.

	julie

	looks out the window with glazed-over eyes.
