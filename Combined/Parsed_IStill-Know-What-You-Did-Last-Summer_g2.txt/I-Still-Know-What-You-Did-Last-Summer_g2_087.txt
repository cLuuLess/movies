85	ext. greenhouse roof - night

	karla keeps a wary eye on ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass.
	the glass begins cracking, subtle crack lines splintering out from her
	footsteps.

	ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook.

	karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto
	her back on the glass.

	she lifts her head. starts to move...crack. the glass is fracuring
	beneath her. she looks through the glass.

	karla's pov - the orchids below

	she tries to slide toward a support...the glass creaks and moans as
	she moves across the room.

					karla
				(to herself)
			oh, god, no --

	she's almost to the support when

	the roof explodes

	taking karla down into the orchid house.
