30	ext. hotel docks - night

	derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow
	rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock.

	ominous shadows play all along the dock. out on the water there's a
	big splash.

	the dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.

					derrick
			damn. i should've brought my pole.

	he turns away. as he does, we see

	the end of the dock

	where a sinister slicker figure stands perfectly still, silhouetted by
	moonlight.

	derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other
	tied-off staff and service boats.

	he picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a sunfish
	sailboat.

	he turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an
	equipment shack. suddenly, a hand touches him on the back. he jumps
	and turns to see --

	titus

	standing there smoking a spliff.

					derrick
			get lost, you scared me.

					titus
			fish are all over the water...come on,
			let us take a boat out.

					derrick
			titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up
			in spain.

					titus
			that's why you'll come with titus, mon.

	derrick throws the hose in its place.

					derrick
			there's a storm comin', titus. no boats
			are going out.

					titus
			storm is what makes it interesting.
			thass why all the fish are up. less
			hook us a couple big ones.

	derrick is now ignoring titus.

					derrick
			i got work to do. take the bake
			elsewhere.

					titus
			up-tighteous and self-righteous.

	titus glides away into the dark. derrick watches him go. there's
	another splash in the water near the dock.

	derrick walks to where the splash was. he kneels down by the edge --
	watching bubbles rise from the dark water below.

					derrick
				(to the fish)
			hello, little sea bass. you're lucky
			i'm busy or i'd hook you myself.

	we push in as his face gets closer to the water --

	and then -- rising slowly from the dark water directly behind the
	dockhand -- a sinister slicker.

	derrick hears a splash -- and just in time for...

	splat! the old hook in the eye. the fisherman pulls him down. he
	screams -- ben yanks on the hook -- and derrick's crumpled body falls
	into the water.

	angle on the water

	as poor derrick's blood mixes with bubbles...
