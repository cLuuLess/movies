69	int. hotel kitchen - night

	they move cautiously into the kitchen. blue emergency lights flicker
	above them. it's a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for
	somebody to be hiding in.

	tyrell picks up a couple of different knives. he hefts them in his
	hand.

					tyrell
			what i need is a gun. not a steak
			knife.

	karla grabs a paring knife --

					tyrell (cont'd)
			you gonna clean vegetables? you
			gonna stir-fry? you need something
			that'll get his attention.

	he picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it. he then
	roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons.

	karla looks to julie, something on her mind. julie catches the look.

					karla
				(hurt)
			i'm your best friend...you could
			have told me the truth about what
			happened. i would've understood.

					julie
				(sad)
			karla, i just wanted the whole thing
			to be over. i didn't want to involve
			anybody else.

					karla
			it's too late for that.

	julie steps over to karla.

					julie
			i'm so sorry. i brought this on
			everyone. it's my fault.

	tyrell picks up on the mood swing. he moves closer to them. he's
	sympathetic.

					tyrell
			forget that. you didn't do nothing.
			this fisherman's a piece of scum.
				(hard for him to admit)
			i should've been listening to you...
			i'm sorry.

	julie smiles for a second.

					tyrell (cont'd)
			now, let's take a look at the
			pantry.

					karla
			you think that's a good place to
			hide?

					tyrell
			i don't know, but i'm starving.
