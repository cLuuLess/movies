63	int. hotel tower room - dusk

	the door to estes's room bangs inward. tyrell, will, karla, and julie
	charge into the room.

					tyrell
			yo, freak boy --

	the cluttered room is empty.

					will
			he's not here.

	tyrell and will begin roughly searching through estes's possessions.

					tyrell
			we're gonna find some weird crap
			in here.

	in the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. julie pulls the
	curtain back and discovers

	a small, heavy cabinet

	sitting in the corner. it seems to glow from inside while casting an
	evil pall over the room.

	julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors.

	inside -- is a small voodoo shrine. a candle has burned low before it.
	hanging before the altar is

	the little straw man

	impaled on a fishhook.

					julie
			voodoo.

					tyrell
			i told you.

	julie looks closer. she sees her toothbrush, a hair tie, assorted
	other knickknacks belonging to her friends.

					tyrell
				(to karla)
			missing a hair tie?

	karla looks in. tyrell snatches the straw man up.

					tyrell
			we found our guy.

	thunder rumbles across the sky like the judgement of god.
