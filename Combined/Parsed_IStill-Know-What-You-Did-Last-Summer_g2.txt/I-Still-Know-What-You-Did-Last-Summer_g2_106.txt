104	ext. orchard - night

	will has julie in a choke hold. he drags her toward the open graves.
	julie is losing energy, slowly giving up.

					julie
			...why?

					will
			why? come on, julie. think. you'll
			get it. will benson -- ben's son.

	he shoves her. she falls backward into the arms of ben willis.

					will (cont'd)
			hi, dad.

	julie wails, struggling wildly in ben's grasp.

					julie
			omigod --

					ben
			that's my boy.

	ben holds her back to look at her. he throws back the hood of his
	slicker. we see his face clearly for the first time.

					julie
			no, no, no --

	ben pulls off his hook and strokes julie's cheek with his stump.

					ben
			shush, now. no more screaming...no
			more running. time to die.

					ray (v.o.)
			let go of her! now!

	ben and will spin to see

	ray

	like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree.

	ben starts to laugh. will joins him.

					will
			you gotta be kiddin' me.

					ben
			what're you gonna do, boy? call
			us names?

					ray
			let her go. now.

	ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. he cocks the hammer.

	ben doesn't let go of julie. lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on
	and gets the point to julie's neck.

					ben
			think about it, boy. you're no
			killer.
				(beat)
			that's my job.

	ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. he does look scared.

	ben takes a step toward ray. then another, pushing julie in front of
	him. will moves closer, too.

					ray
			stop right there.

	ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.

					ben
			you don't have it in you.

	suddenly, will dives for ray. ray gets a shot off, tagging ben in the
	shoulder. the gun goes flying.

	julie spins and hits ben in the face. he knocks her into her own
	grave...mud begins to slide in on her. she tries to scramble out.

	will and ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.

	will has ray down and his hands around his kneck. he looks him in the
	eye.

					will
			we haven't missed you down here,
			ray boy. i got to know julie real
			well.

	will gets the better of ray. he's stronger. he yanks him up -- choking
	him. ray is begging to check out.

					will (cont'd)
			think of all the things i'm gonna
			do to her.
				(beat)
			dad, finish him.

	ben charges toward ray's back. he pulls back the hook for a roundhouse
	slashing --

	at the last second, ray dips, elbows will.

	the hook

	goes straight into will's chest.

	the fisherman has hooked his own son.

	father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank.

	ben stares in shock as will expires, falling back into the mud.

	ben screams in rage. ray is tired.

	thwack. ben begins beating ray. he puches him. he straight-arms him
	with the hook. he knocks him again and again and ray is beaten, giving
	up...

	ben has ray against a tombstone. the hook slowly inches toward his
	eye.

					ben
			gonna blind you first.

	the hook is touching the eyelid --

	a gunshot

	rings out. a look of wonder crosses ben's face. he slowly turns away
	from ray.

	julie

	stands behind him holding the gun.

					julie
			just...die.

	blam. blam. blam. she empties the gun into ben, who flies backward
	into julie's grave.

	as he tumbles, ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...

	a muddy landslide

	slowly covers ben up.

	ben's face is covering over. his mouth starting to fill with dirt --

					ben
			you can't kill me.

	his face is completely covered. his mouth still moving.

					ben (cont'd)
			i'll always be with you.

	the dirt covers him. it continues to fill, until just the

	gleaming metal hook

	waves futilely out of the dirt. then, is stops wiggling.

	julie goes to ray.
