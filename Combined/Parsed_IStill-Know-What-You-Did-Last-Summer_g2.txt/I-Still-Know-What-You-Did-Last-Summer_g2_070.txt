68	ext. woods trail - night

	estes, will, tyrell, julie, and karla walk along a trail through the
	heart of the island. the storm has abated for a few minutes.

	it's windy, dark, and spooky. the kind of place you'd take people if
	you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. that is just what
	estes is doing.

					estes
			he worked here for many years. he
			had a nice family. a pretty wife
			and two little ones. a boy and a
			girl. they'd be about your age, now.

	they continue along the path.

	estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.

					estes (cont'd)
			one day his wife went missing. maid
			found blood all over the honeymoon
			suite -- room 201.

	there are strange noises out in the woods.

					estes (cont'd)
			eventually, they found her body.
			pieces. a leg in the swamp. an arm
			washed up on three mile beach.
				(beat)
			and the head they found much later.

	a huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the
	underbrush, scaring them. estes calmly steps around it.

					estes (cont'd)
			careful --

					julie
				(softly)
			did he do it?

					estes
			people say she was running around on
			him. people say he caught her in bed
			with other men. people say a lot of
			things.
				(beat)
			he disappeared, taking the two small
			ones with him. at least they were
			never found.

	the winding path leads to a small orchard. they hang on his every
	word.

					estes (cont'd)
			we're here.

	in the center of the orchard is a cemetery.

	they move off the path into the safety of the woods. there seems to be
	activity around the place. it's silent and eerie.

	julie stares, fascinated. she is slowly drawn toward the house. karla
	grabs for her arm.

					karla
			be careful, julie.

					julie
			i've got to see.

	she leads, they follow, circling the house. julie rounds a corner of
	the shack and stops. she sees --

	two tombstones

	the first stone reads: sarah willis (birth/death)

	the second stone reads: susie willis (birth/death)

	beyond them

	a freshly dug grave

	and the group moves slowly toward it. the headstone, partially
	obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view.

	the third headstone reads:

					julie james
				born september 6, 1979
				died july 4, 1998
					"a lying whore"

	"a lying whore" is scratched with a knife.

					karla
				(realizing)
			...today's july fourth.

	will goes to comfort julie --

					julie
			i'm not dying on this island,
			will.
				(louder)
			do you hear me?

	julie shouts into the darkness.

					julie (cont'd)
			you want me, ben willis? come and
			get me. i'm right here.

	she kicks over her headstone --

					julie (cont'd)
			my grave stays empty!

	she looks defiantly down the path.

					karla
			julie, the boats are gone, the
			phones are down. there's no way off
			this place.

					julie
			then, we fight --

	will looks around. estes is gone.

					will
			where'd estes go?

					tyrell
			what is up with that weirdo?

					will
			i'll go find him.

					karla
			why? he can't help us.

					will
			he's probably the only one who
			can help us.

					tyrell
			i'll come with you.

					karla
			are you crazy? we're not staying
			here on our own.

					will
			it's okay. he couldn't have gone
			far. i'll catch up with you later.

	will disappears into the darkness.

					karla
			maybe we should just wait here?
			hide in a tree?

					tyrell
			i'm not hiding up no tree.
				(to julie)
			i'm with her. let's arm ourselves
			to the teeth and kick this psycho's
			butt.
