27	int. hotel bar - night

	a resort bar on the beach. ocean breezes and surf sounds come through
	the window.

	it's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging
	from decorative nets from the ceiling. there's a karaoke stage in the
	corner.

	will and tyrell enter and head straight to the bar. a bored bar
	tender, nancy, looks just like jennifer esposito, doesn't look up from
	her paperback.

					nancy
			you guys lost?

					tyrell
				(re: the emptiness)
			tell me this ain't the bar scene.

					nancy
			wanna drink?

					will
			we didn't get all dressed up for
			nothing.

					tyrell
			planter's punch, singapore sling, or
			how about a mai-tai?

					nancy
			how about some id?

	they freeze.

					nancy (cont'd)
			kidding.

	they nod.

					will
			the guy at the desk said the place would
			be quiet, not dead.

					nancy
			didn't anyone tell you this is --

					tyrell
			the last day of the season. yeah, we
			heard.

					will
			so why are you still here?

					nancy
			that's none of your business.

	tyrell sizes her up quickly.

					tyrell
			what's the matter, boy trouble?

					nancy
			not anymore.

					tyrell
			he leave you?

					nancy
			no. i shot him.

	will and tyrell exchange a danger-will-robinson glance.

					nancy (cont'd)
			what you want is a dark and stormy:
			vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch
			of tabasco. sailors drink it for luck
			in the hurricane season, trust me.

	across the bar

	karla and julie walk in talking quietly to one another.

					julie
			am i bad? i mean, he's really great,
			and he's cute --

					karla
			he's cute...and he's got a crush on
			you...
				(off julie's look)
			but...

					julie
				(appologetic)
			i miss ray...i tried to call him.

	karla looks at her. she's sincere, but firm.

					karla
			ray made up his own mind...so, you're
			free to make up yours.

	joining the men, but continuing her thought --

					karla (cont'd)
			for the next foury-eight hours...
				(joking)
			your smile is a frown...turned upside
			down.

	she illustrates with her own big smile.

					tyrell
			pretty cool bar.

					karla
			they all start to look the same once
			you've worked in one.
				(to nancy)
			am i right, sister?

	nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their
	fingers.

					julie
				(to nancy)
			i'm julie. this is karla.

					nancy
			nancy.
				(sarcastic)
			welcome to tower bay's most happenin'
			hotspot.

	nancy continues making their cocktails.

	julie

	backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an old
	whaler, complete with harpoon, white beard, and yellow slicker.

	she doesn't let karla see that it upset her.

	nancy puts their drinks down in front of them.

					nancy
			four dark and stormies...

	they all pick up their drinks.

					karla
				(toasting)
			to a great weekend --

					will
			yeah, a great weekend. forget the
			weather!

					karla & julie
			i'll drink to that!

	they drink and toast again.

					karla
				(to nancy)
			so what do you do around here for fun?

	nancy looks straight at will --

					nancy
			make fun of tourists mainly.
				(beat)
			or let them make fun of themselves...

	she flips a switch that lights the karaoke stage.

					karla
			karaoke -- perfect.

					julie
			don't even think about it.

					karla
			okay, i won't.

	she's already heading for the stage.

					tyrell
			go baby! go!

	at the stage

	close on the karaoke machine. karla flips through a binder full of
	songs.

					karla
			oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is
			for somebody who really needs it.
				(finds one)
			ah-hah! one single with extra cheese!

					nancy
				(it's true)
			everyone thinks their a singer.

					julie
			no way.

					karla
			yes.

					julie
			no.

					karla
			yes.

					julie
			not me...no way...

					will
			come on, it'll be fun.

					karla
			ladies and gentlemen, please put your
			hands together for my friend, my very
			best friend, julie james.

	but there will be no mercy.

					karla, tyrell, & will
				(chanting in unison)
			ju-lie! ju-lie! ju-lie!

	reluctantly she goes to the song book. she sees something
	particularily awful.

					julie
			you asked for it.
				(to tyrell)
			song number thirty-nine.

	tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. julie takes the stage as sappy
	strings begin to swell. she looks at the monitor, then
	melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, belt --
	gloria gaynor's "i will survive."

					julie (cont'd)
				(singing)
			first i was afraid...i was petrified...
				(continues singing under)

	will stands, clapping. tyrell pounds his chest. karla flips up her
	lighter, swaying like a hard-core fan. and julie continues, crooning
	out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.

					julie (cont'd)
				(singing)
			i will survive...i will survive...

	angle on the karaoke monitor

	the schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. but
	then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. red capital\
	letters begin to fill the screen.

					julie (cont'd)
				(singing --
				then trailing off)
			and i still know...what you did...
			last summer...

	her voice trails. her smile abruptly fades.

	microphone

	falls to the floor. the room echoes with an electronic whump. everyone
	stops dancing, confused.

	close - julie

	trembling, shaking, a mess. will jumps onstage.

					will
			julie? what's wrong?

					julie
			it's...him.

					will
			what do you mean, julie?

					julie
			he did something to the screen...it,
			it, said...

	julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. she
	suddenly feels their eyes upon her. they're looking at her like she's
	having a nervous breakdown.

					julie (cont'd)
			nothing. nothing, i'm sorry...

	stung, she rushes off the stage.

					karla
			julie...

	but it's to late. she's bolted from the bar.
