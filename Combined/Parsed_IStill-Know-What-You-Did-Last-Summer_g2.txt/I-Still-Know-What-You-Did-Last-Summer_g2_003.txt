2	int. confessional booth - day

	julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before
	the closed screen. a beat -- and the screen slides open.

	a priest

	enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the wicker mesh.
	julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.

					julie
			bless me, father, for i have sinned.
				(a beat)
			it's been a year since my last
			confession...

	julie swallows hard. this is difficult for her.

					julie (cont'd)
			i've never told anyone this. not my
			mom, not the poice, not even my
			friends -- except for the ones who
			were there and they...well they're
			not around anymore. you see i...i...

					priest
			yes?

					julie
			i killed a man. well, i thought i
			had...then...

	she balks at the memory of it. the priest bows his head in the shadows
	of the other side.

					julie (cont'd)
				(emotional)
			you've got to understand...it was
			all an accident. a terrible accident.
			it's been a whole year. i've tried to
			get past this, but i just can't.

					priest
			go on...

					julie
			i have these dreams...horrible
			dreams. and this man is always there
			with me.

					priest
				(reassuring)
			i know...

					julie
			you see, he was a killer. he
			murdered helen and barry, and he
			would have killed me too, if i
			hadn't...gotten away with it.
				(regathering)
			i don't know, i guess i just need to
			deal with the fear, the guilt...to
			finally say his name. ben willis. his
			name was ben willis...

	the confession is cathartic for julie. she looks relieved until,

					priest
			i know...

	julie stops. looks through the screen. a chill shoots through her
	body.

					julie
			you know? but how could you...

	clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. julie moves closer to
	the screen, trying to get a better look.

					priest
				(growls)
			i know what you did last summer!!!

	a steel hook

	smashes through the screen right in julie's face! she screams!
