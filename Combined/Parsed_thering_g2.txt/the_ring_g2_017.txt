  int. oushi household - top of the stairs  night

  just as yoichi and asakawa are about to descend the steps, 
  asakawas cell phone rings.  she opens the clasp to her purse.

				asakawa	
			(to yoichi) 
		you go on ahead.

				yoichi	
		k.

  he walks down the steps.  asakawa brings out her cell phone, 
  answers it.

				asakawa	
		hello?

				okazaki	
		uh... this is okazaki.  ive got 
		some more info on that article for
		you.  the girl was a student of 
		the uh, seikei school for women in 
		yokahama city.

  asakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed.


				asakawa	
			(softly) 
		thanks.

  she hangs up the phone.
