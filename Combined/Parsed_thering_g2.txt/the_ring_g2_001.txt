  int. ouishi household  tomokos room - night

  closeup on a television set.  theres a baseball game on, but the sound 
  is turned completely down.  camera pans to show two cute high school 
  girls, masami and tomoko.  masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee 
  table, textbook in front of her. tomoko is at her desk.  there are snacks 
  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going 
  on. masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.

				masami
		they say that some elementary school 
		kid spent the night with his parents 
		at a bed and breakfast in izu.  the kid
		wanted to go out and play with everybody, 
		right, but he didnt want to miss the 
		program he always used to watch back in 
		tokyo, so he records it on the vcr in 
		their room.  but of course the stations 
		in izu are different from the ones in 
		tokyo.  in izu, it was just an empty 
		channel, so he shouldve recorded
		nothing but static.  but when the kid 
		gets back to his house and watches the 
		tape, all of a sudden this woman comes 
		on the screen and says--

  masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that tomoko 
  actually jumps in her seat.

				masami (contd)
		one week from now, you will die.

  short silence as masami pauses, relishing the moment.

				masami (contd)	
		of course the kids completely 
		freaked, and he stops the video.  
		just then the phone rings, and when he 
		picks it up a voice says--

  her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.

				masami (contd)	
		you watched it, didnt you?  that 
		same time, exactly one week later... 
		hes dead!

  masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  
  tomoko, however, is completely silent.  she begins looking more 
  and more distressed, until finally masami notices.

				masami
		what is it, tomoko?

  tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her 
  friend.  her words are quick, earnest.

				tomoko
		who did you hear that story from?

				masami
		who?  its just a rumor.  everybody 
		knows it.

				tomoko
		youko told you?	

				masami	
		no, it wasnt youko...

  tomoko looks away, worried.  masami slaps her on the knee, 
  laughing.

				masami
		whats up with you?

  tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.

				tomoko
		the other day, i... i watched this 
		strange video.
		
				masami
		where?

				tomoko	
		with youko and them.

				masami	
			(excited) 
		so thats what ive been hearing 
		about you doing some double-date/
		sleepover thing!  so, you and that 
		guy iwata, huh? 

				tomoko	
		no, its not like that.  nothing 
		happened!

  their eyes meet and tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  her 
  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.

				tomoko
		iwata... he found this weird video.  
		everyone was like, whats that? so 
		he put it on and we all watched it.

				masami
			(quietly) 
		and?  what kind of video was it?

				tomoko
		just... weird, i cant really explain 
		it.  anyway, right after we finished 
		watching it, the phone rang.  whoever
		it was didnt say anything, but still...

  silence.  masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  

				masami	
		jesus.

				tomoko
  		it's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the 
		rumors.

tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.

				tomoko (cont'd)
		that was one week ago today.

  there is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.

				masami  	
		waaait a minute.  are you faking me 
		out?

  tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. 

				tomoko	
		busted, huh?

  they both crack up laughing. 

				masami
		oh, my... i cant believe you!  

  masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.

				masami (contd)
		youre terrible!

				tomoko
		gotcha!

				masami	
			(thinking) 
		but hang on... you really stayed
		the night with youko and iwata, 
		right?

  tomoko nods, uh-huh.  masami dives forward, pinching her friends 
  cheeks and grinning wildly.

				masami	
		so, how far did you and he get?

				tomoko 	
		oh... i cant remember.

				masami	
		you cant remember, huh?

  masami laughs, then slaps tomoko on the knee again as she remembers 
  the trick her friend played on her.

				masami	
		man, you had me freaked me out. 
		i--

  just at that moment, the phone rings.  they are both suddenly, 
  instantly serious.  tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she 
  begins shaking her head, -no-.  masami looks over her shoulder, 
  following her friends gaze.  

  tomoko is looking at the clock, which currently reads 9:40.

  the phone continues to ring.  tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her 
  friend, looking panicked.

				masami
			(softly) 
		was it true?

  tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  masami has to 
  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  the phone is downstairs, 
  so masami opens the bedroom door and races down the stairs.  tomoko 
  calls out to her from behind.

				tomoko
		masami!
