  ext. camera shop  day

  asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching tomokos unclaimed photos.  she 
  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  we see 
  tomoko standing arm-in-arm with iwata, her secret boyfriend. tomoko and 
  her friends eating lunch.  the camera had its date-and-time function 
  enabled, and the photos are marked

    97 8 29.

  the next shot is of tomoko, iwata, and another young couple posing in 
  front of a sign for a bed and breakfast.  the sign reads:

    izu pacific land

				asakawa	
		izu...

  asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the 
  four friends clowning around in their room.  suddenly she comes to a 
  shot taken the next day, at check out.  the friends are lined up, arms 
  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if 
  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of 
  existence.
