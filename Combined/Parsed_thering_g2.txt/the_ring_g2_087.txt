  int. ryujiÂ’s apartment - day  

  the front door opens wildly, noisily forward.  asakawa comes 
  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  she thinks 
  frantically to herself.

				asakawa (vo)
		ryuji... why?  does this mean that
		yoichi will die, too?  is the curse 
		not broken yet?

  her gaze falls to the television set.  she dives forward, presses 
  the eject button on the vcr.  sure enough, the tape is still in 
  the deck.  she takes the tape and leaves.
