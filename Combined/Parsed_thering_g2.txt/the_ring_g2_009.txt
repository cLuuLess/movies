  int. asakawas apartment - living room  day

  a boy of about 7 is sitting in an armchair facing the veranda.  we 
  can see only the back of his head.

				asakawa (o.s.) 
		yoichi!

  hearing his name, the boy puts down the book he was reading and 
  stands up, facing the door.  he is wearing a white dress shirt with 
  a brown sweater-type vest over it.  he sees asakawa, his mother, 
  run in the door.  she is panting lightly.

				asakawa
		sorry im late.  oh, youve already 
		changed.

				yoichi
		yup. 

  he points over to his mothers right.

				yoichi (contd)
		i got your clothes out for you.

  asakawa turns to see a dark suit hanging from one of the living 
  room shelves.  she reaches out, takes it.

				asakawa
		aargh, weve gotta hurry!

  she runs into the next room to change.
