  int. coffee shop - day  

  komiya, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. we can now see that 
  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two 
  friends, a short-haired girl (girl#2) and a long-haired girl (girl #3).  
  they are all dressed in the uniforms of junior high school students.  
  opposite them sits komiya and asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-
  twenties.  a boom mike guy stands to the left.
 
				komiya	
		uh, dont look right at the camera, 
		ok?

				young girl	
		sorry.

				asakawa	
		lets do it again.

  asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that komiya is ready.

 
				asakawa
		have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				young girl
		what i heard was, all of a sudden 
		this scaaarry lady comes on the
		screen and says, in one week, you
		will die.


				girl #2	
		i heard that if youre watching tv 
		late at night itll come on, and
		then your phonell ring.

				asakawa
		watching tv late at night... do you
 		know what station?

				girl #2	
		mmmm... i heard some local station, 
		around izu.

				asakawa	
		izu?

				girl #2	
		mmm-hmm.	

				asakawa
		and, do you know if anyones really 
		died from watching it?

  the girl flashes a look at her two friends.

				young girl
		well, no one that we know, right?

  girl #2 nods her head. girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her 
  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  the 
  reporter notices. 

				asakawa	
		what is it?


				girl #3
		i heard this from a friend of mine 
		in high school.  she said that there 
		was this one girl who watched the 
		video, and then died a week later.  
		she was out on a drive with her 
		boyfriend.

				asakawa
		they were in a wreck?

				girl #3
		no, their car was parked, but they 
		were both dead inside.  her 
		boyfriend died because hed watched 
		the video, too.  thats what my 
		friend said.

  girl #3 grows suddenly defensive.

				girl #3 (contd)	
		its true!  it was in the paper two 
		or three days ago.

				asakawa
		do you know the name of the high 
		school this girl went to?

				girl #3
		no... i heard this from my friend, 
		and it didnt happen at her school.  
		she heard it from a friend at a 
		different school, she said.
