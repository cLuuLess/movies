  int. asakawas car  day

  closeup on the vcr in the passenger side.  cut to asakawa at the 
  wheel as time spirals forward, the decisions of the present 
  already become rumor of the future.

		they say theres a way you can stay 
		alive after you watch the video.  
		youve gotta make a copy of it, and 
		show it to somebody else inside a week.

				girl b (vo) 
		but what about the person you show it 
		to?

				girl a (vo) 
		well, then they make a copy and show it 
		to somebody else.  again, inside a week.

				girl c (vo) 
			(laughing)
		then theres no end to it.

				girl a (vo) 
		thats just it.  there -is- no end.  but 
		if it meant not dying... youd do it, 
		wouldnt you?

  asakawas eyes begin to well.  her car speeds along the highway, 
  to the direction of menacing-looking storm clouds.
