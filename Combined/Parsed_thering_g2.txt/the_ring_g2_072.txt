  ext. mr. yamamuras fishing boat - dawn  

  ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.  he heads down 
  below toward the captains area.  mr. yamamura is at the wheel.

				ryuji	
		we made it.  maybe sadako doesnt 
		have it out for us after all.

  long pause as mr. yamamura says nothing.

				yamamura
		shizuko... she used to -speak- to 
		the ocean, just ramble away.  one 
		time i hid, listenin to one of her 
		conversations.

  mr. yamamura pauses again.

				yamamura (contd)	
		and it werent in no human language.
