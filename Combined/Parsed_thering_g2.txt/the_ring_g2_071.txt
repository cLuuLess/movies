  int. mr. yamamuras fishing boat  night

  ryuji and asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin.  asakawas 
  expression is dreamy, faraway.

				asakawa
		its funny.  im not afraid at all.  

  ryuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly.  suddenly he switches 
  back into analytical mode.

				ryuji	
		sadako probably died back out there
		at izu, before the rental cottages 
		were ever built.

				asakawa	
		so, sadako was professor ikumas 
		daughter?

				ryuji
			(nodding) 
		ikuma smuggled her out in secret.  
		his relationship with shizuko was 
		already a scandal, and one of the 
		reasons he got drummed out of the 
		university... weve gotta find 
		sadakos body.



				asakawa
			(excitedly) 
		is that going to break the curse?  
		will yoichi be all right?

				ryuji	
		its all weve got left to try.

				asakawa	
		just one more day...

  ryuji puts his arm around asakawa.
