  int. ouishi household  kitchen - day  

  asakawa stands before her sister ryomi, who is seated at the kitchen 
  table.  ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging 
  her sister.  the silence continues unabated, and asakawa, pensive, 
  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  she takes a long look at 
  the television, the same television that had puzzled tomoko by suddenly 
  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  her reflection in 
  the screen looks stretched, distorted.


				ryomi	(o.s.) 
		they tell me that yoichi came to 
		the funeral, too. 

  asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  she addresses her sister, who 
  continues to stare out at nothing.

				asakawa
		mmm-hmm.

				ryomi
		they used to play a lot together, didnt they?  upstairs.

				asakawa	
		yeah...

  ryomi lapses back into a silence.  asakawa waits for her to say more, 
  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives 
  up and exits the kitchen.
