  int. ouishi household - night 

  mother and son halt before the open door to the main wake room, where 
  guests may show their respects to the departed.  the room is laid in 
  traditional japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that 
  serves as a carpet. two guests, their shoes off, are kneeling upon 
  zabuton cushions.  

  kneeling opposite the guests is kouichi, asakawas father.  the two 
  guests are bowing deeply, and kouichi bows in response.

				asakawa	
		dad.

  kouichi turns to see her.

				kouichi
		ah!

				asakawa
		how is sis holding up?

				kouichi
		shes resting inside right now.  
		shes shaken up pretty badly, you 
		know.  its best she just take 
		things easy for a while.

  asakawa nods.

				asakawa
		ill go check on auntie and them, 
		then.

				kouichi
		ok.  ah, yoichi.  why dont you sit 
		here for a little while?

  he grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  
  as the guests resume their conversation with asakawas father, yoichis 
  eyes wander to the altar at the front of the room set up to honor the 
  deceased.  it is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and 
  small paper lanterns.  at the center is a picture of the deceased, a 
  teenage girl.  a small wooden plaque reads her name: tomoko ouishi. it 
  is the same tomoko from the first scene.

  yoichi continues to stare at tomokos picture.  he makes a peculiar 
  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just 
  between his eyes.
