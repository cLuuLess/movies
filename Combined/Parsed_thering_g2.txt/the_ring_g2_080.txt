  int. ryujis apartment  morning

  ryuji sits busily scribbling into a notebook.  he stops writing a 
  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of coffee.  he 
  glances over at his blackboard for confirmation when a small scowl 
  crosses his brow.  its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly 
  to himself.

		that girl...

  ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  he fixes mais little 
  prank with a single chalk stroke.
