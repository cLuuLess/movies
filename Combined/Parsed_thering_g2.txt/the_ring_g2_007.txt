  int. news station  day

  asakawa is seated at her desk.  the station is filled with people, 
  scrabbling to meet deadlines.  komiya walks up to asakawas desk 
  and holds out a manila folder.

				komiya	
		mrs. asakawa?

				asakawa
		hm?

				komiya	
		here you are.

				asakawa
			(taking the folder) 
		thanks.

  komiya has a seat.

				komiya	
		this same kind of thing happened 
		about ten years ago too, didnt it?  
		some popular young singer committed 
		suicide, and then suddenly there was 
		all this talk about her ghost showing
		up on some music show.

				asakawa	
		but i wonder what this rumors all 
		about. everyone you ask always 
		mentions izu.

				komiya	
		maybe thats where it all started.  
		hey, where was that kuchi-sake
		onna * story from again?


  >* literally ripped-mouth lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from 
  >japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which 
  >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. she wanders the 
  >countryside at night asking men do you think im beautiful? then 
  >lowering her veil to reveal her true features.


				asakawa	
		gifu, but there was some big 
		accident out there, and that ended
		up being what started the rumor. 

				komiya
		a big accident?

				asakawa	
		mmm-hmm.  something terrible like 
		that is going to stay in peoples 
		minds.  sometimes the story of what 
		happened gets twisted around, and 
		ends up coming back as a rumor like 
		this one. thats what they say, at 
		least.

				komiya
		dyou think something like that 
		happened out at izu?

				asakawa
		maybe. well, anyway, im off.  see you
		tomorrow.
   
				komiya
		see you.

  asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit.  
  she takes only a few steps before noticing a rack of recent daily 
  editions.  

  she takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby table.  she begins 
  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  

    strange automobile death of young couple in yokohama

    the bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their 
    passenger car at around 10 a.m. september 6th.  the location was a 
    vacant lot parallel to yokohama prefectural road.  local authorities 
    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student 
    of tokyo, and a 16-year old yokohama resident, a student of a 
    private all-girls high school. because there were no external 
    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced 
    suicide...

  just then two men walk by, a guy in a business suit and a youngish 
  intern named okazaki.  okazaki is carrying an armload of videotapes.

				guy in suit
		ok, okazaki, im counting on you.

				okazaki	
		yessir.

  the guy in the suit pats okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  

  okazaki turns to walk away, spots asakawa bent over the small table 
  and peering intently at the newspaper article.


				okazaki	
		miss asakawa?  i thought you were 
		going home early today.

  asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

				asakawa
		okazaki, can i ask you a favor?

				okazaki
		sure.

  asakawa points to the newspaper.

				asakawa
		could you check out this article 
		for me?  get me some more info.?	

				okazaki
		i guess...

				asakawa	
		good.  call me as soon as you know 
		more, ok?

				okazaki	
		maam.

  asakawa walks off.  okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans 
  forward to take a look at the article.
