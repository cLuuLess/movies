  int. news station - viewing booth  day

  asakawa and yoshino, another news reporter, are watching scenes 
  from the yokohama car death.  in the footage there are lots of 
  policemen milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to 
  the passenger side.  yoshino is giving asakawa the blow-by-blow.

				yoshino
		the bodies of those found were 
		tsuji youko, age 17, a student of 
		the seikei school for women, and 
		nomi takehiko, age 19, preparatory 
		school student.  both their doors 
		were securely locked.

  onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  the door opens, 
  and a girls body halffalls out, head facing upwards.  yoshino flicks 
  a button on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  he 
  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. 

  her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes 
  wide and glassy. yoshino and asakawa lean back in their seats.

				yoshino
		this is the first time ive -ever- 
		seen something like this.

				asakawa
		cause of death?

				yoshino
		couldnt say, aside from sudden 
		heart failure.

				asakawa	
		drugs?

				yoshino	
		the autopsy came up negative.


  yoshino takes the video off pause.  onscreen, a policeman has caught 
  the young girls body from completely falling out, and is pushing it 
  back into the car.  as the body moves into an upright position, we 
  can see that the girls panties are mid-way around her left thigh.

				yoshino
		these two, about to go at it, 
		suddenly up and die for no 
		apparent reason. 

  he sighs.

				yoshino (contd)
		do -you- get it?
