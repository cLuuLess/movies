  int. asakawas apartment - day  

  ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  the interior is dark, 
  ominous somehow.  he takes his jacket off and wanders into the living room.  
  asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing tea.  ryuji spies the 
  collection of framed photographs in living room.

				ryuji
		yoichis in elementary school 
		already, is he?

				asakawa	
		his first year.  what about you, 
		ryuji?  how have you been 
		recently?

				ryuji		
		same as always.

  she takes a seat next to him, serves the tea.  on the coffee table 
  before them is a videotape in a plain, unmarked case.

				asakawa
		and money is...?

				ryuji
		im teaching at university.

  ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his 
  lips.  he rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  ryuji 
  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.

				ryuji
		anyway.  you said that the phone rang?

				asakawa
		thats right.

				ryuji		
		so if i watch it too, that phone over 
		there--

  he gestures with his mug 

				ryuji (contd)
		--should ring.

				asakawa
		ryuji, four people have already 
		died.  on the same day!

				ryuji
			(flippant) 
		well, why dont you try calling 
		an exorcist?

  he takes a sip of his tea.  asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something 
  from the bookshelf behind her-- a polaroid camera.    she shoves it 
  into ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.

				asakawa	
		take my picture.

  ryuji raises the camera to his eye.

				ryuji		
		turn this way.


				asakawa	
			(unmoving) 
		hurry up and take it.

  ryuji snaps off a shot.  it comes out the other end and he takes it, 
  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  when it does, all he can 
  do is pass it wordlessly over to asakawa.  her face is twisted, 
  misshapen.  

  just like the picture of tomoko and her friends.

  asakawa stares at it, horrified.  by the time she finally looks up, 
  ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the 
  vcr.  again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced 
  with what looks like the moon.  asakawa slams the polaroid on the 
  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.
