  int. ouishi household  kitchen - night  

  a bottle of soda that tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on 
  the kitchen table.  she picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  
  before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly 
  charged, heavy.  her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight 
  comes a popping, crackling sound underscored by a kind of groaning.  
  trembling now, tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt 
  lurking behind her.  she draws in her breath to scream.

  the screen goes white, and fades into:

  camera pov 

  the screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking young girl.  
  she is being interviewed by asakawa, a female reporter seated offscreen.

				asakawa (o.s.)
		there seems to be a popular rumor 
		going around about a cursed 
		videotape.

				young girl	
		uh-huh.

				asakawa (o.s.) 
		have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				young girl	
		uh-huh.

  the girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an o 
  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  she continues 
  staring, silently, at the camera.
