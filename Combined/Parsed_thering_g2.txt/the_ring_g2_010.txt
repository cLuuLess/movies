  int.  bedroom  day

  asakawa has changed into all-black funeral attire.  her hair is 
  up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl necklace.  yoichi is 
  still in the living room.

				asakawa	
		did grandpa call?

				yoichi (o.s.) 
		nope.

  yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother.

				yoichi	
		why did tomo-chan die? *


  >* -chan is a suffix in japanese that denotes closeness or affection.  
  >it is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for 
  >boys.


				asakawa	
		well... it looks like she was really, 
		really sick.

  she takes a seat on the bed.

				asakawa	
		will you do me up?

  yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up.  

				yoichi	
		you can die even if youre young?

				asakawa
		if its something serious... well, yes.

  asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him.

				asakawa	
		as hard as it is for us, what your 
		auntie and uncle are going through 
		right now is even harder, so lets 
		not talk about this over there, ok?

  yoichi nods.

				asakawa
			(remembering)
		you and her used to play a lot 
		together, didnt you?

  yoichi says nothing.
