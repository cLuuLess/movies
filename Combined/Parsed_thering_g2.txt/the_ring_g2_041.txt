  ext. in front of a train station - day  

  some quick shots of a fountain gushing water, pigeons flapping away 
  looking agitated.  cut to ryuji sitting on a bench.  hes deep in 
  thought, writing in a notepad. there are multitudes of people about 
  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  a pair 
  of legs attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, 
  heading directly for ryuji.  her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as 
  that pace progresses all other sounds fade into the background, so 
  that all we can hear is the clomp, clomp as those legs walk to stand 
  just before ryuji.  the pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  

  a gust of wind rips by.  ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his 
  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced babbling heard on the 
  videotape.  the sound grows stronger.

				ryuji (vo)
 		so, it was you.  you did it.

  the babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal 
  background sounds return.  ryuji looks up, but the woman in white 
  is nowhere to be seen.
