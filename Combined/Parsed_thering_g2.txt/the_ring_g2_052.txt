  int. kouichiÂ’s house - living room - night  

  yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  a television looms 
  inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  the 
  sliding doors to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see 
  futons set out, ready for bed.

  asakawa enters the living room and, seeing yoichi, scoops him up in
  her arms and carries him over to the guest room.

				yoichi
			(sleepily) 
		how was work, mommy?

  asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off.
