  ext. street  day

  it is dark and raining heavily.  yoichi, asakawas son, is walking to 
  school, umbrella firmly in hand.  the sidewalk is quite narrow, and yoichi 
  comes to a halt when a second person comes from the opposite direction, 
  blocking his way. yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at 
  this other pedestrian.  it is a man, a bag slung over one shoulder.  he 
  has a beard; unusual for japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  

  the two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor 
  speaking.  yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his
   way.  the man resumes walking as well.
