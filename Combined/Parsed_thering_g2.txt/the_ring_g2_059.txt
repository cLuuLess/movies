  int. hayatsus minivan - day  

  ryuji and asakawa sit in the back.  mr. hayatsu is behind the wheel, 
  chattering away.

				hayatsu	
		back in the old days, the yamamuras
		used to head fishing boats out in 
		sashikiji, though they dont much 
		anymore.  you know, one of shizukos 
		cousins is still alive. hes just an 
		old man now.  his son and his 
		daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned 
		inn.  i went ahead and booked 
		reservations for yall, hope thats 
		alright...

  asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the 
  minivan lapses into silence.  asakawa looks dreamily out at the 
  mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to.

				asakawa
			(to ryuji) 
		why did yamamura shizuko commit 
		suicide?

				ryuji	
		she was taking a real beating 
		in the press, being called a 
		fraud and all sorts of names.  
		after a while she just lost it. 

  cut to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road.
