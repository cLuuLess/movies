  ext. river  day  

  asakawa stands on a riverbank while her father and yoichi, gumboots on, 
  are ankle-deep in a shallow river.  yoichi holds a small net, and 
  asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly. 

				kouichi
		there he is!  cmon, there he is, 
		dont let him go!

  yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out.

				kouichi
		oh, oh!  ah... guess he got away, 
		huh?

				yoichi	
		that was your fault, grandpa.

  asakawas father laughs.

				kouichi	
		well, whaddya say we try again?

  he begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, yoichi in 
  tow.

				kouichi
		well get im this time.

  asakawa looks away, pensive.
