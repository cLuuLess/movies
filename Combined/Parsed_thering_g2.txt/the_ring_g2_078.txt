  ext. outside askawas apartment - night  

  ryujis white car pulls up into the parking lot.  he and asakawa 
  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. there is 
  a long moment where neither of them says anything.

				ryuji	
		get some rest.  

  he flashes her the slightest of grins. 

				ryuji (contd)
		i still have a thesis to finish. 

  cut to a shot of ryuji and asakawa, the car creating an almost 
  metaphoric distance between them. 

				asakawa
		...thank you.

  ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  he gets into his car and 
  drives off.  asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the 
  entrance of her apartment.
