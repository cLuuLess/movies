  int. hallway outside ryujis apartment  day

  mai is there, slumped against one wall. asakawa comes running up, 
  dropping to her knees and grasping mai by the shoulders.

				asakawa
		what happened?

  mai shakes her head dreamily.

				mai
		when i got here he was just 
		lying there...

				asakawa	
		did he say anything to you?  about 
		a videotape?

  mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath 
  catches in her throat.


				mai
		his face...

  mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  asakawa leaves her 
  and crosses toward the door to ryujis apartment.
