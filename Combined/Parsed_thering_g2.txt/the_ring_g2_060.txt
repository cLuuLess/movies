  int. hayatsus minivan  day 

				ryuji
		shizuko was getting a lot of 
		attention around the island after
		predicting the eruption of mt. 
		mihara.  seems that for some time 
		shed had a rather unique ability:
		precognition. it was around then
		that she attracted the attention 
		of a certain scholar whom you may 
		have heard of; ikuma heihachiro.   

				asakawa
		he was driven out of the university, 
		wasnt he?

  ryuji nods.

				ryuji
		this professor ikuma convinces 
		shizuko to go to tokyo with him, 
		where he uses her in a series of 
		demonstrations meant to prove the 
		existence of esp.  at first shes 
		the darling of the press, but the 
		next thing you know theyre 
		knocking her down, calling her a 
		fraud.  hmph.  forty years later,
		the media still hasnt changed that
		much.

  asakawa continues, ignoring ryujis barb.

				asakawa
		ive heard this story.  but... im 
		sure i remember hearing that somebody 
		died at one of those demonstrations.

  a strange look crosses ryujis face.  he looks away, ignores her 
  for a moment.

				ryuji
		after getting kicked out of 
		university, ikuma just vanished, 
		and no ones been able to get hold 
		of him since.  hes probably not 
		even alive anymore.

				asakawa
		but, why even try looking for him?

				ryuji
		because hes supposed to have had a 
		child with shizuko.  a daughter.

  asakawa freezes.  in her mind, she sees a small figure dressed in 
  white, its face hidden by long, black hair.  it is the figure from 
  the video.
