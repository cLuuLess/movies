  ext. country road - day  

  a car speeds along.  cut to a gravel driveway leading up to a wooden, 
  traditional-style house.  kouichi, asakawas father, is standing before 
  the entrance and puttering around in his garden.  the car from the 
  previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.  the passenger door opens and 
  yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.  asakawa walks leisurely 
  after her son.

				kouichi

		yoichi says hes looking forward to 
		doing some fishing with you.

				kouichi	
		is that so?

  yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm.

				yoichi	
		cmon grandpa, lets go!

				kouichi	
		ok, ok.  well get our things 
		together and then we can go.
