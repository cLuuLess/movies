  int. hallway  night

  asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  she walks until 
  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  there are a few people in 
  there, preparing busily. asakawa sees her aunt, who rushes into the 
  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  the aunt speaks in a 
  fierce, quick whisper.

				aunt		
		have you heard anything more about 
		tomo-chans death?

				asakawa	
		no, i...

				aunt		
		but the police have already finished 
		their autopsy!

				asakawa	
		well, they said there was no sign of 
		foul play.

				aunt	
			(shaking her head) 
		that was no normal death.  they havent 
		once opened the casket to let us see
		the body.  dont you think thats 
		strange?
 
  asakawa looks away, thinking.
