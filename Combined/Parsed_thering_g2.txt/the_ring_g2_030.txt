  int. pacific land - cottage b4  day

  asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  it looks very modern, 
  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  

  her eyes rest on the tv/vcr setup at the front of the room.  crouching 
  before the vcr now, she presses the eject button.  nothing happens.  
  she fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind 
  to the rear of the vcr, searching.  again, there is nothing.  asakawa 
  presses the power button on the television, picks up the remote, and 
  takes a seat on the sofa.  she runs through a few channels but theyre 
  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  she flicks the tv off and leans 
  back in the sofa, sighing.

  just then, she spies a ledger on the coffee table.  these things are 
  sometimes left in hotels in japan, so that guests can write a few 
  comments about their stay for others to read.  asakawa picks the 
  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  she stops at a strange picture
  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely 
  round personages.  she reads the handwritten message.

				asakawa	
		"my dad is fat.  my mom is fat.  
		thats why im fat, too."

  she smiles in spite of herself.  

  asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else 
  of any import.  

  she tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into 
  the sofa and closes her eyes.
