  ext. outside cottage b4  night

  three police cars are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson 
  headlights flashing.   a few cops walk by, two of them carrying 
  something off in white plastic bags.  cut to ryuji and asakawa 
  sitting on the curb.  asakawa is staring off at something, a blanket 
  draped over her shoulder.  

				asakawa	
		why would ikuma have killed her?  
		his own daughter...

				ryuji
		maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  

				asakawa
		what?

				ryuji
		maybe her father... wasnt even human.

  the two exchange glances.  ryujis gaze falls to asakawas wrist, 
  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  the ugly 
  bruise where sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.

				ryuji
		its gone...  

  he shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.

				ryuji
		enough, already.  its over.  cmon.  
		ill take you home.

  ryuji stands, pulls asakawa to her feet.
