  int. ouishi household - tomokos bedroom - night  

  yoichi has wandered into tomokos bedroom.  the lights are all off, 
  and there is an eerie feel to it.  yoichis eyes wander about the 
  room, finally coming to rest on the television set.  suddenly, he 
  hears his mothers voice from behind him.

				asakwawa (o.s.) 
		yoichi?

  yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.

				asakawa	
		what are you doing up here?  you
		shouldnt just walk into other 
		peoples rooms.

  without replying, yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television 
  set.  asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet 
  her.

				asakawa	
		you go on downstairs, ok?

				yoichi	
		ok.

  he turns to leave, and asakawa follows.
