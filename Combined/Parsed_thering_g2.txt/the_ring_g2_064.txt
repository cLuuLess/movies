  int. yamamura villa - dining room  night

  the table is laid out with an elaborate-looking dinner.  asakawa 
  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  
  she is whimpering softly to herself.  just then, the door slides 
  open and ryuji walks in.  he sits at the table and picks up a 
  pair of chopsticks.

				ryuji		
		arent you gonna eat?

				asakawa	
		umm...

				ryuji		
		hm?

				asakawa	
		youll stay with me wont you?  
		when its time for me to die.

				ryuji		
		oh, stop it.

  asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs 
  ryuji fiercely by the arm.

				asakawa
		youll stay, wont you?  if you 
		stayed, maybe youd learn something
		that could help yoichi--

				ryuji
		i said stop it!  have you forgotten 
		there was a girl with tomoko when 
		she died?  that girls now in a 
		mental institution.  who knows what 
		could happen. 

				asakawa	
		but you could stay with me, ryuji.  
		youd be ok.


				ryuji
			(angrily)
		why, because im already not 
		right in the head?

  asakawa releases her hold on ryujis arm, lowers her head.  ryuji 
  slams his chopsticks down angrily.

				ryuji	
		if thats the case, why not just
		let things run its course, get rid
		of father -and- son?  yoichi was a
		mistake, anyway.

				asakawa
		stop it!

  short silence.  when ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, 
  reassuring.

				ryuji	
		we still have two days left...

  just then the voice of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from 
  the other side of the sliding door.

				kazue (o.s.) 
		excuse me?

				ryuji	
		come in.

  kazue slides the door open.  she stands hesitantly in the doorway, 
  something tucked under one arm.


				kazue	
		its about miss shizuko.  

  ryuji shoots a glance at asakawa and stands up from the table, 
  walks towards the innkeeper.

				kazue	
		this is all that there is...

  kazue produces an old black and white photograph.  the photo shows a 
  woman, seated, dressed in a kimono.  a man in a western-style suit 
  stands beside her.  

				ryuji	
		is this professor ikuma?

  hearing this asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for 
  herself.

				kazue
		...yes.  this picture is from before 
		id entered the household.  

  she pauses a moment.

				kazue (contd)
		i should go now.

  the innkeeper scuttles off, leaving asakawa and ryuji alone with the 
  photograph.  unbidden, the voice from the video enters their 
  thoughts.

				voice
		shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...
