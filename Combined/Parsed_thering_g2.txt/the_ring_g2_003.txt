  int. ouishi household  kitchen - night  

  masami has come to a halt before a phone mounted on the wall.  she 
  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  she 
  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  the 
  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. masami suddenly breaks 
  into a huge grin.

				masami	
		ill put her on.

  still grinning, she hands the phone to tomoko.  tomoko snatches it 
  quickly.

				tomoko
			(softly) 
		yes?

  she is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  

				tomoko
		oh, man!

  she is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she 
  sinks to the kitchen floor.  masami, equally relieved, slides down 
  the wall and sits down next to her.

				tomoko
			(on the phone) 
		yeah, ive got a friend over now.  
		yeah.  yeah, ok.  bye.

  tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then 
  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.

				tomoko	
		the games gone into overtime, so 
		theyre gonna be a little late. 

  they burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both 
  clutching their stomachs.

				tomoko	
		jeeezus, my parents...

				masami	
		oh man, im tellin everybody about 
		this tomorrow!

  tomoko shakes her head, -dont you dare-.

				masami	
		im gonna use your bathroom.  dont 
		go anywhere.

				tomoko	
		k.

  masami walks out of the kitchen. alone now, tomoko stands and walks 
  toward the sink, where she takes a glass from the dish rack.  she 
  then goes to the fridge and sticks her face in, looking for something 
  to drink.  suddenly there is the sound of people clapping and 
  cheering.  tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator 
  door to check for the source of the sound.  

  she begins walking slowly, following the sound to the dining room 
  adjacent the kitchen.
