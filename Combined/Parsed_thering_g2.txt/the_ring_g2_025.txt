  int. asakawas apartment  kitchen - day

  asakawa wears an apron, and is frying something up on the stove.  yoichi 
  stands watching.

				asakawa	
		look, im probably going to be late
		coming home tonight, so just stick 
		your dinner in the microwave when 
		youre ready to eat, ok?

				yoichi	
		k... mom?

				asakawa	
		hmm?

				yoichi	
		tomo-chan watched some cursed video!


  asakawa leaves the food on the stove, runs over to yoichi and grabs him 
  by the shoulders.  she shakes him roughly.

				asakawa	
		what did you say?  you are not to 
		speak of this at school, do you 
		hear me?

				yoichi	
			(utterly unfazed) 
		i wont.  im going to school now.

  yoichi walks off.  asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only 
  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.
