  int. ouishi household - tomokos room - day  

  as if intruding, asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into tomokos room.  
  the window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white paper 
  on tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  asakawa walks towards it, picks 
  it up.  it is a receipt from a photo shop.  the developed photos have yet 
  to be claimed.  

  asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  her sister 
  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the 
  doorway to tomokos room.  she appears not to notice what asakawa has in 
  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  
  she regards it almost druggedly.

		tomoko!

  ryomis hands fling aside the closet door.  within, she finds the pale 
  blue carcass of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  
  tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back 
  of her head.  her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it 
  out by the roots.  it is a horrific scene, one that says tomoko died as 
  if from some unspeakable fear.

  present

  ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  she puts her 
  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  asakawa says nothing.
