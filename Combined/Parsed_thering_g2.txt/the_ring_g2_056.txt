  int. koujis house - guest room  night

  the lights are all off and asakawa is asleep in her futon.  her eyes 
  suddenly fly open as a voice sounding eerily like her deceased niece 
  tomoko calls out to her.


				tomoko (o.s.) 
		auntie?

  asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  her eyes fall on 
  the futon next to hers.

				asakawa
		yoichi?

  there is a body in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in 
  black.  it is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned 
  away.

  suddenly, the image from the video of the figure with its face 
  shrouded springs to asakawas mind.  just an instant, its pointing 
  visage materializes, and then disappears.  it reappears a moment 
  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  

  asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is 
  empty.  yoichi is nowhere to be seen.

  just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic squeaking from the 
  video.  eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--
  --and there, seated before the television, is yoichi.

  he is watching the video.

  it is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. 
  closeup on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that 
  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  the video cuts 
  off, and the screen fills with static.  

  shrieking, asakawa races over to yoichi, covers his eyes though it is 
  already too late.  she scoots over to the vcr, ejects the tape and 
  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  she is then at yoichis side again, 
  shaking him roughly.

				asakawa
		yoichi!  you brought this with you, 
		didnt you?  why?!?

				yoichi	
		tomo-chan...

  asakawa freezes, her eyes wide.

				yoichi	
		tomo-chan told me to watch it.
