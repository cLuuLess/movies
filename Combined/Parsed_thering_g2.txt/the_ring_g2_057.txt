  ext. ocean  day
  
  waves are being kicked up by a large passenger ship as it speeds on 
  its way.  cut to asakawa and ryuji standing on deck, looking out over 
  the waves.

				ryuji	
		i shouldve been more careful.  
		when i was at your place that 
		day, i could feel something 
		there.  i thought it was just 
		because of the video... 

				asakawa	
		you mean that tomoko

				ryuji		
		thats not tomoko.  not anymore.



				asakawa	
		yoichi... he can see them too, 
		cant he?

  ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.

				asakawa	
		its all my fault.  first tomoko 
		died, then those three others.  it 
		should have stopped there, but it 
		didnt.  because of me.

				ryuji	
		i wonder...

  asakawa turns to ryuji suddenly.

				asakawa
		how did the rumors about the 
		video even start in the first 
		place?


				ryuji	
		this kind of thing... it doesnt 
		start by one person telling a 
		story.  its more like everyones 
		fear just takes on a life of its 
		own.

				asakawa	
		fear...

				ryuji
		or maybe its not fear at all.  
		maybe its what we were 
		secretly hoping for all along.
