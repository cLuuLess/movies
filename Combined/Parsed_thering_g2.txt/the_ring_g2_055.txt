  int. koujis house  staircase - night  

				asakawa
		have you got anything else?

				ryuji (o.s.) 
		im gonna have to check it for 
		myself.  ill be leaving for 
		oshima tomorrow morning.

				asakawa
		oshima?  ive only got three days 
		left!

				ryuji (o.s.)
		i know.  and ive got four.

  short silence.

				ryuji (o.s.)
		ill be in touch.

  ryuji hangs up.  asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone 
  back in its cradle.  she turns around to walk back down the hallway 
  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.

				kouji
		whats happened?

  asakawa shakes her head.

				asakawa
		nothing.  i just had some things 
		left over from work.

  she walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his 
  shoulder.
