  int. ryujis apartment  afternoon

  ryuji and asakawa enter the living room.

				ryuji
		so, whatd you come up with?

				asakawa
		i dont think any of the guests on 
		the list brought the tape with them.  
		i couldnt confirm it face-to-face 
		of course, but even over the phone i 
		got the feeling they were all being 
		upfront with me.

 				ryuji
		how about the other angle?  pirate 
		signals or...

  asakawa shakes her head.

				asakawa
		therere no traces of any illegal 
		television signals being broadcast 
		around izu. 

  she reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white envelope.


				asakawa
		heres that copy of the videotape 
		you wanted.

  ryuji tears the package open.  he squats down on the tatami in 
  frontof his tv and slides the tape in.  asakawa sits on the 
  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the tv and keeps 
  her eyes averted.  ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.

				ryuji
			(sternly) 
		asakawa.

  she reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  ryuji 
  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the 
  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  he puts 
  the video on frame-by-frame. 

				ryuji
		have you ever seen this woman?

  asakawa regards the screen intently.

				asakawa
 		no...

  the tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes 
  positions.  when it does, we can again see the small figure in the 
  white gown, a figure with long black hair. when ryuji sees this 
  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  asakawa notices but says nothing.  
  she also notices something else.

				asakawa
			(excitedly) 
		theres something strange about 
		this shot.

  she takes the remote from ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  onscreen, the 
  woman begins coming her long hair again.

				asakawa	
		from this angle, the mirror should 
		be reflecting whoevers filming.

				ryuji		
		so, what does that mean?

  asakawa lets out a short sigh.

				asakawa	
		well, if the person who made this 
		is a pro, thered be a way around 
		that, i guess, but still...

  the screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters 
  again.

				ryuji		
			(reading) 
		volcanic eruption... eruption where?

  he pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.


				asakawa	
		this is gonna be impossible to figure 
		out on just a regular tv screen, 
		dont you think?

  they are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes 
  the sound of someone opening the front door.  ryuji turns off the tv, 
  ejects the tape from the deck.

				ryuji	
		come on in.

  asakawa flashes a look at ryuji and then turns her head back towards 
  the front door to see who has entered.  a cute, nervous-looking young 
  girl with short hair approaches slowly.  she is carrying a plastic bag 
  filled with groceries.

				ryuji	
		asakawa, meet my student, takano mai.

  he turns, addresses mai.

				ryuji	(contd)	
		this is asakawa, my ex-wife.

  ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.

				mai		
		nice to meet you.  im takano.

				asakawa	
		asakawa. *


  > * as you may already be aware, japanese name order is the 
  >opposite of englishs, and even close friends may continue to
  >address one another by their last names.  incidentally, asakawas
  >first name is reiko.  in this scene, mai deferentially refers
  >to ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher.


  mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after ryuji.  he is 
  putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.

				mai	
		sensei, the people from the 
		publishing company called about 
		the deadline on your thesis again. 

				ryuji		
			(brusquely) 
		whatre they talkin to you 
		about it for?

				mai		
		because they can never get a 
		hold of you.

  ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.

				ryuji		
		ask them to wait another week.

				mai		
		sensei, ask them yourself, 
		please.

  ryuji is already headed for the door.  his back is to her as he 
  responds.

				ryuji	
		ok, ok.

  asakawa walks after him.  they leave.

  mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea 
  crosses her mind.  she walks across the room to where ryuji has set 
  up a large blackboard filled with mathematical equations.  grinning, 
  mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a 
  new value.
