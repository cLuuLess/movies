  int. asakawas apartment - morning

  all the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room 
  couch watching the footage of her café interview with the junior high 
  school girls.  

  caption-- september 16th.  thursday.

  just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches 
  the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, asakawas 
  own phone rings, startling her. she runs to answer it.

				asakawa	
		hello?

				ryuji (o.s.)
		ive got it.  its a dialect, just 
		like i thought.  shoumon means 
		playing in the water and boukon
 		means monster. *


  >* translated from standard japanese, the phrase from the videotape 
  >would initially have sounded like, "if only shoumon then the 
  >boukon will come."  these two capitalized words, later identified to 
  >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to ryuji 
  >and asakawa.  dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in 
  >japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to
  >understand one another.  

  >the phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "if you keep playing in 
  >the water, the monster will come for you."


				asakawa	
		but, dialect from where?

				ryuji	
		oshima.  and the site of our 
		eruption is mt. mihara.
