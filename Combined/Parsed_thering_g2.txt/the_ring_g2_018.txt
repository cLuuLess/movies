  ext. ouishi household - night  

  asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  dazedly, she 
  walks toward a large, hand-painted placard.  the placard reads 
  that the wake is being held for a student of the seikei school 
  for women. 

  asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  
  she turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby trio of high school 
  girls.

				asakawa	
		excuse me.  this is, um, kind of a
		strange question, but by any chance 
		were you friends of that young girl
		that died in the car as well?

  the three girls turn their faces to the ground.

				asakawa	
		please.  if you know anything...

				girl right	
		they all died the same day.  youko.  
		tomoko.  even iwata, he was in a
		motorcycle accident.

				girl left	
		because they watched the video.

				asakawa	
		video?

				girl left	
		thats what youko said.  they all
		watched some weird video, and 
		after that their phone rang.

				asakawa	
		tomoko-chan watched it, too?  
		where?

  girl left shakes her head.

				girl left	
		she just said they all stayed 
		somewhere.

				girl right	
		there was a girl with tomoko when 
		she died.  shes had to be 
		hospitalized for shock.

				girl middle
		they say she wont go anywhere 
		near a television.
