  int. pacific land - front reception - night  

  asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  as she walks in the 
  door, the counter clerk rises out of his chair to greet her.

				clerk
		room for one?

				asakawa	
		um, actually im here on business.

  she passes the clerk a picture of tomoko and her three other friends.  
  he stares at it for a moment.



				asakawa
		they would have stayed here on 
		august 29th, all four of them.  
		if theres any information you 
		might have...

				clerk
		uh, hang on just a minute.  

  the clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.

				clerk	
			(to himself) 
		august 29th...

  while she waits, asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  
  behind the desk is a sign reading rental video, and a large wooden 
  bookshelf filled with videotapes. they are all in their original boxes, 
  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  raiders of the lost ark, 
  48 hours--

  --and then, suddenly, she spies a videotape in a plain, unmarked 
  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  she feels 
  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.

				asakawa	
		that...

  the clerk looks up.

				clerk
		hmm?

  asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.


				asakawa
		that!  what tape is that?

  the clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.

				clerk	
		this?  hmm...

  the clerk pulls the tape out of its sleeve and checks for a label.  
  its unmarked.

				clerk
		maybe one of the guests left it behind
