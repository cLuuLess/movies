  ext. izu pacific land - driveway  day

  asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is 
  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental 
  cottages. 

  she wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  she pauses 
  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her purse.  she 
  withdraws the picture from the photomat, the one that showed tomoko and 
  her friends with their faces all blurred.  the four are posing in front 
  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as b4.  asakawa lowers the 
  photo to regard the cottage before her.

  she walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  its open.  
  asakawa walks in.
