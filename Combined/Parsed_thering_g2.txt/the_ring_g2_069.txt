  ext. izu wharf  night

  asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning. 

  several fishing boats are docked.  the wind whips her hair crazily 
  around.   she continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--

				asakawa	
			(calling) 
		ryuji!

  asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards ryuji.  he is 
  in mid-conversation with mr. hayatsu.

				asakawa	
		ryuji!  the phone in my apartment 
		never rang!  it only ever rang at
		the rental cottage!  professor 
		ikuma mustve...

				ryuji	
		and weve got no way of going back.

				hayatsu	
		its too dangerous!  the thought of 
		anybody going out in this weather...

  the three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their 
  situation.  suddenly, a deep voice booms from behind them.

				yamamura (o.s.) 
		ill take you out.

  the three spin around to see mr. yamamura, his robes flapping in the 
  gusty night air. he begins walking towards them.

				yamamura	
		sadako is callin yall, reckon.  
		mayhap to drag you down under the 
		water.

  short silence.  ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at asakawa, 
  turns back to face mr. yamamura.

				ryuji	
		please.  take us out.
