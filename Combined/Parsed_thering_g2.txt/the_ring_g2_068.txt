  int. mr. hayatsus house  night

  asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer.  her 
  eyes are wide and glassy.  the phone rings suddenly and asakawa dives 
  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.

				asakawa	
		hello?

				okazaki (o.s.) 
		mrs. asakawa?  im sorry.  i tried, 
		but i couldnt come up with any 
		leads at all.

  a look of abject fear crosses asakawas face.  she begins retreating 
  into herself.


				okazaki (o.s.) 
		hello?

				asakawa
			(softly) 
		thank you...

  asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle.  almost immediately, 
  her face begins to crumple.  she falls to her knees, sobbing into the 
  floor.

				asakawa	
		yoichi...

  she cries a while longer but suddenly stops.  her face, eyes streaked 
  with tears, shoots suddenly up, stares directly at the telephone.

				asakawa	 
			(softly) 
		izu...
