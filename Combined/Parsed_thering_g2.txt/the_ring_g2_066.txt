  int. mr. hayatsus house  dusk

  asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.

				asakawa
		thats right. after yamamura shizuko 
		committed suicide, professor ikuma
		took the daughter and ran.  no, no one
		knows where they went.  thats why i 
		need -you- to find out where they are.  
		even if the professors dead, sadako 
		should still be in her forties.  ill 
		explain it all later, but right now 
		just hurry!

  asakawa slams the phone down.  pan to show ryuji slumped in one corner 
  of the room, his back to the wall.

				ryuji	
		sadakos probably already dead.  she
		could kill people with just a thought, 
		remember?  her mother wasnt even 
		close to that.


				asakawa	
			(flustered) 
		well, what about that video?  if 
		sadakos dead then who made it?

				ryuji	
		nobody made it. it wasnt made at 
		all. that video... is the pure, 
		physical manifestation of sadakos 
		hatred.

  ryuji turns to regard asakawa, his eyes blank.

				ryuji
		weve been cursed.

  there is a moment of silence before mr. hayatsu slides the door open, 
  almost falling into the room.  he is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.

				hayatsu	
		its no good.  with the typhoon 
		coming in, all ships are 
		temporarily staying docked.

				ryuji	
		what about the fishing boats?  
		tell their captains ill pay.

				hayatsu
		fishing boats?  sir, without knowing 
		whether this typhoon is going to hit 
		us or not, i think itd be better to 
		wait and see how things turn--

  ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  glasses 
  rattle wildly.

				ryuji	
		fine!  ill try searching myself!

  ryuji stands and races past mr. hayatsu out into the rain.  hayatsu 
  takes pursuit, calling after him.

				hayatsu	
		mr. takayama!?  mr. takayama...

  asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.
