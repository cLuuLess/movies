  int. yamamura villa - 2nd floor  day

  kazue gives a little bow.

				kazue
		this way.

  kazue turns to the right.  almost immediately after reaching the 
  top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses ryujis face.  
  he heads down the opposite end of the corridor, asakawa close 
  behind.

				kazue
			(alarmed) 
		sir!

  ryuji flings open the sliding door to one of the older rooms.  there, 
  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped mirror from the 
  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  
  ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  he turns around as if 
  to look at asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  asakawa 
  follows his gaze, as does kazue.  standing at the end of the corridor 
  is an old man, mr. yamamura. 

  yamamura regards them silently, balefully.  breaking the silence, 
  kazue gestures for asakawa and ryuji to follow.

				kazue
			(softly) 
		please, this way.

  asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  he keeps his 
  back turned towards her.

				asakawa
		please!  if you could just answer 
		a few questions, about shizuko...

				yamamura
		i got nuthin to say.

				asakawa
		its about shizukos daughter.

  the old man says nothing.

				asakawa
		she did have a daughter, didnt she?

  yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away.

				yamamura	
  		youre wasting your time.
