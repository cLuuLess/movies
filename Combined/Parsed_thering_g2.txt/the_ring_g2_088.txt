  int. asakawas apartment - living room  night

  asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  she drops the videotape 
  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a chair.  her eyes 
  fall to the framed photographs of yoichi on one of the shelves.  
  this snaps asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering 
  intently to herself, thinking.

				asakawa
		i was the only one to break 
		sadakos curse.  ryuji... why...?  
		something i did that you didnt...  
		something i did that you didnt...  

  asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  when she looks 
  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and 
  its glare reveals that there is someone else in the room with her.  
  it is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the 
  cloth draped over its face.  with a start, asakawa realizes that 
  the figure is wearing ryujis clothes.

				asakawa
		ryuji?!

  she spins around, but the room is empty.  asakawas mind races.  
  the figure had been pointing towards her bag.  she stands, 
  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  
  she takes ryujis copy in her other hand, her eyes darting 
  between the two tapes.

				asakawa
		something i did that you didnt...

  it suddenly clicks home as asakawa looks full-on at ryujis 
  version of the tape, plainly marked copy.

				asakawa
		what broke the curse was that i copied 
		the tape and showed it to someone else!

  cut to asakawa slowly pulling her vcr from the television stand.  
  a look of almost frightening resolve etches her face.
