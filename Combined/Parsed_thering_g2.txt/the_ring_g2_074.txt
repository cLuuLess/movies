  ext. hardware store  day

  ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  he holds a 
  pair of buckets in one hand and a crowbar and shovel in the other.  a 
  length of rope is coiled over his left shoulder.  he runs towards a 
  rental car, passing by asakawa who stands at a payphone, receiver in 
  hand.

				yoichi (o.s.) 
		hello?

				asakawa	
		yoichi?  its mommy.  i just called 
		to say ill be coming home tomorrow.

  ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder.

				yoichi (o.s.) 
		im tired of it here, mom!  i wanna
		go back to school.

				asakawa
			(smiling) 
		yoichi, its rude to your grandpa 
		to talk like that.

				yoichi (o.s.) 
		hes laughing.  you wanna talk to him?

				asakawa	
		no, thats...

  asakawa pauses, her voice hitching.  she seems about to lose 
  her composure.

				asakawa	
		im sorry, yoichi.  ill... ill 
		see you tomorrow.  

				yoichi (o.s.)	
		whats wrong?

  asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears.

				asakawa	
		mommys got something she has to do.  
		say hello to grandpa for me, ok?

  ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at asakawa.  he shuts the door 
  just short of a slam.  cut to asakawa hanging up the phone.  she half-
  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring 
  blankly into space.  ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his 
  seatbelt.  

				ryuji		
		what time was it when you first 
		watched the video?

  asakawa glances at her watch.

				asakawa	
		seven or eight minutes past 
		seven.  pm.  no more than ten 
		minutes past.
 		
				ryuji
		if the rumors are true, that 
		time is gonna be our deadline.

  asakawa buckles up as ryuji steps on the gas.
