int. dolphin office - continuous
ace is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. melissa is starting to warm to him.
melissa
 that was pretty impressive, what
you did back at the apartment.
ace
(still looking)
 you don't have to tell me. i was
there.
melissa
 maybe you should have joined the
police force become a real
detective.
ace
(shaking his head)
 i don't do humans.
melissa gets a bit closer.
melissa
 you really love animals, don't
you?
ace stops searching and looks into her eyes.
ace
 i feel a kinship with them. i
understand them. wanna hear
something kinda spooky?
melissa
 sure.
she gets closer still.
ace
 one time, when i was about twelve,
i had this dream that i was being
followed by a dog with rabies. he
had these really bloodshot eyes
and foam coming out of his
mouth and just before i got to
my front door he jumped on me
and sunk his teeth in. then i
woke up, and felt the back of my
neck check this out.
ace motions for melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, 
barking like a vicious dog.
ace
 ararar!!!
melissa jumps out of her skin.
melissa
 ohhh!! you bastard!
ace
(snickering)
 i'm sorry. i couldn't stop
myself. are these all the
receipts?
melissa
(mildly annoyed)
 i don't know.
ace
 there's only a dozen of them here.
ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. melissa begins to clean up his 
mess.
melissa
(pointedly)
 gee maybe they were misplaced
because somebody didn't put the
files back when he was
ace
 who the hell is that?
melissa
 what
ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a 
player.
ace
 that! who the hell is that?!
he quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.
melissa
 oh, that's ray finkle the
kicker. don't you know who ray
finkle is?
ace
 no! how come he's not in this
picture?!
melissa checks ace's photo.
melissa
 this was the picture you were
using? this was taken earlier in
the year. finkle wasn't added to
the roster till mid-season.
she starts to realize what ace has already figured out.
melissa (cont'd)
 he's the guy that missed the final
field goal in the super bowl that
year. cost the dolphins the game.
ace
 but he got a ring?
melissa
 definitely.
