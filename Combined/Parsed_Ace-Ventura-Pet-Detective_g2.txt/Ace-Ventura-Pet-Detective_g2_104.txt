int. storage room - continuous action
cartons everywhere. ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked finkle.
ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. in the third box, he hits the 
jackpot: he finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to marino. die-dan potholders, shredded 
isotoner gloves. he opens a little diary. "laces out!" is insanely scrawled on every page.
ace finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads:
search called off for missing hiker
ace
(reading)
 a massive search ended today when
rescue workers were unable to find
the body of lois einhorn
(stunned)
 a camper reported lost since
friday
(to himself)
 lois einhorn holy shit balls.
ace sits bewildered.
