int. adelle's friendly pet shop - next day
close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. we pull back to reveal adelle 
rosenberg, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. she's handing a live goldfish in 
a bag to jennifer,  a very sweet nine year old.
adelle
 here you go, honey. now
remember this kind of fish
doesn't like it in the freezer.
jenny
 but what's gonna happen to dolly?
adelle
 don't worry, i'll make sure she
gets a proper burial.
jennifer exits. adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. the cat catches it in mid-air.
adelle
 rest in peace.
ace enters the pet shop. it looks like he slept in his clothes.
adelle
 well here comes another dead
fish.
ace
 hi, beautiful. what time do you
get off?
adelle
 uh oh.
ace
(suggestively)
 i've heard some pretty great
things about your kibble.
adelle
 well, i hope i'm not getting a
reputation.
ace
(switching to mock anger)
 just get me the food!
she chuckles at ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.
adelle
 so ahh, when can i expect you
to pay your tab?
ace
 i'm a little bit sli  pickins,
right now, i'm a little tight
squeeze louise, a little welfare
wolly, potless pissing pete, i'm
ah 
adelle
 if you were a horse i'd shoot ya'.
just take it.
ace
 gravy! i'm good for it, adelle.
i'm on a very big case right now.
ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.
ace
 see this pigeon? it's a true
albino. some rich guy lost it.
he's offering a ten thousand
dollar reward.
adelle
 wow, albino pigeons are very
rare. how are you going to find
him?
ace
 just keep my eyes open, and hope
to god it doesn't snow.
ace grabs his bags and heads for the door.
adelle
 you're a good boy, ace. a good
boy.
he holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. the gentleman 
is walking a toy poodle on a leash. the poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the 
floor. ace and adelle just stare.
elderly man
(in a loud voice)
 do you have anything for ringworm?
