int. shady glade acres - hallway - day
the doctor is showing melissa around. ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary 
shoulder pads.
doctor
 this is our therapy room arts
and crafts
they turn a corner. ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats.
doctor (con't)
 that's the storage room. this
hallway leads to another
recreational area 
ace whistles loudly and gestures like a referee
ace
 halftiiiime!!
ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room.
melissa
 he'll be fine by himself for the
next twenty minutes.
doctor
 well, why don't i show you the
dormitories, then?
they leave ace.
after a beat, ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door.
