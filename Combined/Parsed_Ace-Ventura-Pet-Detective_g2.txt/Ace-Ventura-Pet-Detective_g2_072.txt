int. finkle house - day
ace
 it's a real honor.
mrs. finkle
 my ray is so appreciative of his
fans. he'll be so pleased you
stopped by.
ace
 are you expecting ray anytime
soon?
mrs. finkle
 oh, yes. i expect him home any
minute.
ace is surprised.
mrs. finkle
 would you like some cookies? i
just baked them.
mrs. finkle hurries off to the kitchen. ace smiles at mr. finkle. the guy's a corpse.
ace
 wow ray finkle's house! can't
wait to meet him!
mr. finkle
 ray ain't comin' home.
ace
 but your wife said you expect him
home any minute.
mr. finkle
 she expects him home any minute.
he points to his head, and looks toward the kitchen.
mr. finkle
 engines runnin but there's no one
behind the wheel. ten years ago
our son escaped from shady acres
psychiatric hospital in tampa.
they're still buggin' us to pick
up his stuff.
mrs. finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies.
mrs. finkle
(sweetly)
 it was all that dan marino's
fault, everyone knows that. if he
had held the ball laces out, like
you're supposed to, ray would
never have missed that kick. dan
marino should die of gonorrhea and
rot in hell. would you like a
cookie, son?
ace takes a cookie. holding it up.
ace
 hey, what do ya know. they're
little footballs.
mrs. finkle
 laces out!
crash!! a large stone smashes through the window. outside, a pickup truck filled with drunken 
patrons from the pigskin sports bar drives by yelling their finkle chant.
mob
 finkle sucks! finkle sucks!
mrs. finkle
 i told you he had a lot of fans.
mrs. finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window. it hits one of the vandals, 
knocking him out cold, as the truck peels away.
mr. finkle
(aside to ace)
 she got the arm. the boy got the
leg.
