ext. metro police department - later that day
a flurry of activity in the detective division. as ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by 
the obnoxious, sergeant aguado.
aguado
 hey, ventura! make any good
collars lately?
another cop
or were they leashes?
they all bust up. aguado spots a bug on the ground.
aguado
 uh oh.
(steps on the bug)
 homicide, ventura!
the cops are falling all over themselves laughing.
aguado
 how you gonna solve this one?!
ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.
ace
 good question, aguado first i'd
establish a motive. in this case
the killer saw the size of the
bug's dick, and became insanely
jealous.
the other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". aguado has no comeback. ace comes face to face 
with him.
ace
 then i'd lose thirty pounds
porking his wife.
aguado suddenly loses it and swings at ace.
with a lightening move, ace sidesteps the punch and forces aguado's face down next to the dead 
bug.
ace
 now kiss and make up.
ace walks off.
ace
(to himself)
 llloooser!
ace walks to the desk of emilio echavez, a young energetic member of the homicide 
division. ace has a silly impish look on his face.
ace
(playfully)
 i miss you.
emilio
 it's not a good time, ace. if
einhorn sees me talking to you i'm
gonna be history.
ace
 okay. just tell me what you got
on snowflake. that's all i need.
emilio
 i can't say anything. my hands
are tied.
ace
(effeminate)
sounds like my kind of a party.
a cop comes to emilio's desk.
cop
look alive, einhorn's on her way
down.
emilio
 ace, please?!
ace
 just tell me who's working the
case?
emilio
 aguado.
ace
 aguado?! he's pimple juice! he's
the poster child for lead paint
chip eaters!
emilio
 look, ace. we're a little busy
with murderers and drug dealers.
a missing dolphin isn't exactly a
high priority.
the elevator is getting closer.
emilio
 ace, gimme a break will ya?
ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.
emilio
(quickly)
 okay, okay. we checked all the
local animal rights groups,
taxidermists, and we're running a
check through dmv on all recent
van rentals. so far, nada.
ace
 any unusual bets being made?
emilio
 ace, it's the super bowl, of
course there's bets being made.
ace
 what'd you find out about the
tank?
emilio
 nothing weird. just the tire
tracks and the exit route. the
guard didn't see anything.
ace
 that's it?
emilio
 that's it. i swear. now please
go away!
ace
 you know something?
(again impish)
 you're nice!
ace gets up and exits the room. then just as emilio sighs with relief, ace pops back in.
ace
 what about crazy philly fans?
the elevator bell rings. out steps police lt. lois einhorn, mid 30s, with a slender build, a 
great pair of legs and a bad tude.
ace
 holy testicle tuesday!
einhorn
(to emilio)
 what the hell is he doing here?
ace
 i came to confess. i was the
second gunman on the grassy knoll.
einhorn
 spare me the routine, ventura. i
know you're working the snowflake
case. may i suggest you yield to
the experts on this one? we'll
find the porpoise.
ace
(mock relief)
 whewww now i feel better!
ace turns to go.
ace (cont)
 of course, that might not do any
good. you see, nobody's missing a
porpoise. it's a dolphin that's
been taken. the common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout,
pointed teeth, and a triangular
thorasic fin, while the bottlenose
dolphin, or tursiops truncatus,
has an elongated beak, round,
cone-shaped teeth, and a
distinctive serrated dorsal
appendage. (beat) but i'm sure
you already knew that. (beat)
that's what turns me on about you.
hey maybe i'll give you a call
sometime, lieutenant. your number
still 911? alrighty then!
ace exits.
