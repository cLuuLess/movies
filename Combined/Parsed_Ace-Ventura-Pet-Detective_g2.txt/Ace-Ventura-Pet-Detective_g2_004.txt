int. 3rd floor - day
elevator doors open. the ups man throws the package out onto the floor and starts 
kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. with one last big kick the parcel lands in front of 
apartment 3b. he picks it up and knocks on the door.
we hear a small dog barking.
gruff man (o.s.)
 shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!
an angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.
gruff man
 what do you want?
ups man
 ups, sir. and how are you this
afternoon? alrighty then!
the man grumpily unchains the door. he's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. a 
small shiatsu stands beside him.
ups man
 i have a package for you.
the ups guy thrusts the package toward the man. we can clearly hear broken glass inside. the 
man takes the package.
gruff man
 it sounds broken.
ups man
 most likely sir! i bet it was
something nice though! now... i
haver an insurance form. if you'll
just sign here, here, and here,
and initial here, and print your name
here, we'll get the rest of the
forms out to you as soon as we
can.
the man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. the dog wags his tail and whines. we can see 
that he likes the ups guy.
ups man
 that's a lovely dog you have. do
you mind if i pet him, sir?
gruff man
(mumbles)
 i don't give a rat's ass.
the ups man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.
ups man
 oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!
gruff man
(under breath)
 brother.
before the gruff man can finish, the ups man stands back up and takes the form again.
ups man
 that's fine sir. i can fill out
the rest. you just have yourself
a good day. take care, now! 'bye
'bye, then!
thrash music starts
