ace
 excuse me, sir. do you know where
i can find the pigskin sports bar?
fern
 do i have a "kick me" sign on my
back, son?
ace
 i wouldn't know anything about
that, but if you could point me
toward the bar.
fern breaks down, sobbing.
fern
 they all left me all of them!
ace
 well hypothetically speaking,
say they all left you and went to
the pigskin sports bar. how would
they have gotten there from here?
fern
 two miles down and take the first
left.
ace
 thanks very much! take care now,
'bye 'bye then!
ace gets into his car and pulls out.
