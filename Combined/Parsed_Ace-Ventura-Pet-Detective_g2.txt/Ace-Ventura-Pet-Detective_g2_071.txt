ext. house - day
ace pulls up outside a two-story stilt house. the place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, 
bullet holes and paint bombs. toilet paper is strewn through the trees. ace walks up and knocks 
on the door. a wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes.
ace
 Â…hi, i'm looking for ray finkle.
a gun slides out into ace's face.
ace
(with a gulp)
 and a clean pair of shorts.
a deep gruff voice from inside.
voice

after a beat the peephole closes. the door slowly creaks open revealing mr. finkle, an 
unsmiling, taciturn, elderly man holding the gun.
mr. finkle

scumbags from 'hard copy'?
ace

finkle fan. this is my graceland,

mrs. finkle, a sweet, adorable elderly woman comes over.
