ace
 this is chicken little. the sky
is falling.

back to emilio
a beat as he listens to ace's news.
emilio
 i don't get it. what's it mean?
intercut ace/emilio
ace
 it means she's involved in this.
the article's dated the day before
finkle disappeared.
emilio
 before who disappeared?
ace
 finkle. ray finkleÂ… the guy who
took the dolphin? the guy you're
supposed to be looking for?!
einhorn didn't tell you, did she?
emilio
 hey, ace. i see where you're
goin' with this and you're goin'
alone.
a crazy guy stands next to ace now and begins mimicking everything he says.
ace
 come on, e. i tell her about
finkle, she doesn't tell a soul.
i have an article here that
connects her with finkle. you
gotta' check her out.
(to crazy guy mimicking)

the crazy guy stops and moves to one of the phones.
emilio

insurance and benefits.
crazy guy
(into receiver)

get me.
ace

decision here.
(beat)

i think i just solved the lindberg
case.
melissa and the doctor return.
doctor
 well, look who's trying to use the
phone.
ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice.
ace
 brian piccalo is dead.
ace breaks down. melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away.
we hear a thrash version of the theme to "brian's song" as they exit the hospital.
