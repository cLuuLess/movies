int. apartment 3b - cont'd
we see the back of the shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. he has not moved an inch. 
the gruff man looks over.
gruff man
 hey, stupid! get away from the
door!
the dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. he gets up and heads for the dog.
gruff man
 what's the matter with you, i said
git!!!
he roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a 
stuffed dog. around it's neck is a business card that reads, "you have been had by ace ventura - 
pet detective." he breathes fire.
gruff man
 son of a bitch!
he smashes the dog to the ground.
