int. bilbo's gas station - day
a pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. fern bilbo sits at his cluttered desk with the 
end of an old shotgun in his mouth. he is struggling to reach the trigger.
through the glass behind him, we see ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump.
ding! the bell rings. fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks 
out.
