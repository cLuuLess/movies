int. basement - night
woodstock is at his computer. ace looks over his shoulder. finkle's social security information 
appears on the screen.
woodstock
 this guy's last reported income
was september, 1982.
ace
 well then. we know he's
incredibly thrifty.
woodstock
 is he?
ace
 isn't he?
woodstock types in more information. finkle's trw flashes on the screen.
woodstock
 well, i think we can be pretty
sure he's involved in the
kidnapping of the dolphin.
ace
 really? what makes you say that?
woodstock
 there's two-thousand dollars worth
of smelts on his visa card.
after a beat ace realizes it was a bad joke.
ace
 please yank me no further. i beg
of you.
woodstock
 alright already. the last time
this guy used his credit card was
june, '84. he rented a car from
avis. and eww he was a bad
boy. they found it abandoned two
months later in south miami.
ace
 anything else?
woodstock
 nope.
ace
 well you did all you could.
thanks for nothin.
woodstock

friend ray finkle doesn't exist.
ace

woodstock
