ext. track - day
once again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. suddenly ace runs up behind him, 
with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. he leaps onto the 
man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. the man slowly gives up 
the fight and collapses. ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.
