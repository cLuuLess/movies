ext. melissa's apartment - night
ace and melissa pull up in the old heap.
ace
 good job today. you're quite a
dirty rotten filthy liar.
melissa
(flattered)
 thanks. are you sure you don't
want to stay here with me?
ace
 naw, i got some thinking to do.
besides, you'd be safer with
salman rushdie
melissa
 okay.
she gets out of the car, then turns and leans in the window.
melissa
 listen i know there isn't much
time left. the game is tomorrow.
but i know you've done your best.
it's just an impossible situation.
i don't expect..
ace

ace leans over and kisses her.
ace (cont'd)
 bet on the dolphins.
