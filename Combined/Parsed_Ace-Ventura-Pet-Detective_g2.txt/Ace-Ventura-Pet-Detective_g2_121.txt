int. industrial plant - day
einhorn is now in front of the big screen tv singing the national anthem along with bon jovi. 
the thugs, vinnie and roc, are behind her standing at attention.
the song ends. the crowd cheers.
in a sultry fashion einhorn circles marino now.
einhorn
 i just love super bowl sunday,
don't you, dan? a magical
afternoon where dreams are made
or crushed!
dan
 look lady, if you want tickets,
you're going about it in the wrong
way.
einhorn
 do i look familiar to you, dan?
does it seem as if we've met
someplace before?
dan
 i don't know i get hit in the
head a lot!
on the tv the ref makes an announcement.
ref
it's tails. the eagles will
receive.
dan really struggles now.
einhorn
 oops. looks like we're going to
have to kick, dan.
einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. and in perfect sync with the kicker on tv, she 
boots a ball through a window of the warehouse.
marino doesn't know what to think.
einhorn
 i made some refreshments, dan.
would you like some refreshments,
dan? i'll be right back,
daaaan!!
she goes. dan struggles, but to no avail.
marino
 look, i don't know how much psycho
woman is paying you guys, but i
can double it.
vinnie
 sorry, danny boy. psycho woman
keeps us out of prison.
vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices snowflake to the surface. roc raises a football.
roc
hey, marino, check it out. i'm
throwin' passes to a dolphin!
he chucks the ball and hits snowflake, hard. the thugs both laugh hysterically.
snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. snowflake laughs now, the thugs are 
furious.
vinnie
 get some more fish!
