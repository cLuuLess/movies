int. tea room - night
a full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. the same 
burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music.
ace
(shouting)
 nice to see you again!
the burnout just keeps thrashing. ace spots woodstock watching the band and joins him.
woodstock
 st. francis, how's it goin'?
ace
(kidding)
 that's none of your damn business.
woodstock
 isn't it?
ace
 is it?
woodstock
 anything new on that dolphin?
ace
 got his picture on some tuna cans,
but nothing so far.
a singer roars on stage. he sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery.
singer
arroohhghhh! myrrrooohghhhh!
geroooghhh!
woodstock
 so, what can i do for you today?
ace
 i need info on a football flunky
named ray finkle.
woodstock
 sorry, ace, i can't help you right
now. i gotta watch this band!
they are the shit!
ace
 are they?
woodstock
 aren't they?
ace
 alright then. don't worry about
it. i mean dolphins aren't
exactly an endangered species.
it's not like the whole food
chain's gonna be affected if one
highly intelligent mammal dies a
slow and painful death! hell, if
the band is loud enough, you won't
even hear its pitiful whimpering!!
ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. woodstock is no longer enjoying the band.
