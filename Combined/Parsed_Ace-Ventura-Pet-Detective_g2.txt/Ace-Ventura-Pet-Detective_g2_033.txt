int. camp's mansion - cont
ace and melissa enter. camp looks over.
camp
 melissa! glad you could make it!
oh, and who is this?
melissa
 this is my date. he's a
lawyer.
camp
 well, does he have a name, or
should i call him "lawyer"?
melissa
 i'm sorry, it's ace - ah, tom ace.
ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. he jumps in.
ace
 tom ace. wonderful to meet you,
mr. camp, and congratualtions on
all your success. you smell
terrific.
camp
 ah, well, thank you. please, come
in.
ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. melissa closely follows.
melissa
(sotto)
 this is insane. there's no way
that camp stole snowflake.
ace
(spreading pate' on a cracker)
 will you just keep him occupied,
while i work my magic please.
she crosses the room. he puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. a man in a tux 
beside ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.
ace
(with a mouthful, to man)
 smooshy, isn't it?
off the stuffy man's reaction
