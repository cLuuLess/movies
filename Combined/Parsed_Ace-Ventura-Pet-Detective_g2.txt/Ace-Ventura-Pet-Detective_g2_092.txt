int. einhorn's office - continuous action
einhorn
 and somebody get me a cup of
coffee!
ace
(tv announcer's voice)
 tonight on "miami vice", crockett
geets the boss coffee!
ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. einhorn walks to her private 
bathroom.
einhorn
 ventura, when i get out of this
bathroom, you better be gone.
ace
 is it number one or number two?
einhorn turns and glares at ace.
ace
 i just want to know how much time
i have.
einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands.
ace
 oh, by the way, i went ahead and
solved that pesky,
snowflake/podacter/marino thing.
einhorn (o.s.)
(humoring him)
 oh yeah?
ace
 yeah, ever hear of a former
dolphin kicker named ray finkle?
the water shuts off. einhorn appears around the corner.
einhorn
 alright, ventura. make it quick.
ace
 i found a rare stone at the bottom
of snowflake's tank. it's from a
dolphin '82 afc championship ring.
it would have been a super bowl
ring, but ray finkle missed the
big kick. blames the whole thing
on marino. we're talking
paranoid, delusional psychosis. i
saw the guy's room cozy, if
you're hannibal lector.
einhorn
 so how does roger podacter fit in?
ace
 my guess is finkle was snooping
around. podacter recognized him.
end of story. as for snowflake
they gave him finkle's number, and
taught him how to kick a field
goal. finkle took it personally.
einhorn listens with great interest.
einhorn
 so where is finkle, now?
ace
 he broke out of a metal hospital.
did a claude raines. he's been
planning his revenge for years.
waiting for the perfect time to
get back at the dolphins. the time
when it would hurt them the most.
super bowl time! man, i'm tired
of being right!
einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. she's totally softened her demeanor.
einhorn
 congratulations. you've done some
fine detective work, ace.
ace
 ahh, could you talk in my good
ear. i thought i heard you call
me ace.
einhorn gets real close.
einhorn
 maybe i was wrong about you.
maybe you are more than just a pet
dick.
she suddenly plants a major, tonsil cleaning, open mouthed kiss on 
ace. objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back.
ace
 your gun's digging into my hip.
more kissing, the ace stops.
einhorn
(still coming on)
 what's wrong, ace? want me to
read you your rights?
ace
 maybe later.
einhorn
 what is it? that bony little
bitch, melissa robinson?
ace
(defensive)
 no. you just don't do anything
for me.
he quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. einhorn withdraws with a coy smile.
einhorn
 i'll be here if you ever want a
real woman.
there's a sharp knock at the door.
einhorn
 what is it?
aguado opens the door.
aguado
 everything okay in here?  heard
some commotion.
einhorn
 fine, sergeant.
aguado
 you want me to throw him out?
einhorn
 why don't you throw yourself out.
aguado
 yes, ma'am.
a crestfallen aguado exits. ace heads for the door.
einhorn
 ace, i want you to leave
everything to us.
ace
 can't do that, lieutenant. i was
hired to find snowflake.
einhorn
 when we find marino, we'll deliver
snowflake.
ace
 when i find snowflake, i'll
deliver marino.
he exits.
