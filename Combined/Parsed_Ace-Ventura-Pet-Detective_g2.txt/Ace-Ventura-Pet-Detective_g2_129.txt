int. ironworks factory - day
einhorn cocks her gun. ace's face is glistening with tears. he's a complete wreck.
ace
 don't kill meeee!!
pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! i'll
never tell anyone! i swear!
(indicating marino)
 he's the one you want!! kill
him!!
marino
(indicating ace)
 no kill him!
the two argue. einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.
einhorn
 no, i'm gonna kill the dolphin
first.
(to ace)
 i wouldn't want you to miss that.
einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. she aims the gun at snowflake and fires!
we see the bullet miss snowflake under water.
snowflake swims wildly. she fires again! misses again. suddenly, ace hollers!
ace
 blue forty-two!!
einhorn turns to ace.
einhorn
 shut up!!
ace
 blue forty-two!
einhorn shoots at ace! he dives out of the way.
ace
 hut! hut!
suddenly, snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of einhorn's hand, like the trick 
we saw earlier. snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.
ace
(smug)
 yes. the highly trained dolphin.
perhaps the smartest mammal in the
animal kingdom. see how he knew
exactly what i wanted him to do,
as if our minds were somehow in
complete synchronization. they
have been know to save men at sea
you know. they have their own
language.
(to snowflake)
 snowflake. come here, snowflake!
bring me the gun!
(makes dolphin sounds)
 eeeeee! eeeeee! eeeeee!
just like the trick in his routine, however, snowflake swims around the tank, passes ace, then 
hands the gun back to einhorn. he finishes with a tail walk.
ace
(under his breath)
 stupid fish.
on tv: miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.
john madden
 he got all of his leg into that
one!
the field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.
ace
 good to see someone who doesn't
buckle under the pressure?
marino
 yeah, not like in 82 when we
choked
einhorn walks to ace and puts the gun against his head.
einhorn
 what would you know about
pressure?
ace
 well, i've kissed a man.
john madden (on tv)
 of course, there's never been a
more crucial kick than the famous
kick heard 'round the world
the famous footage airs on tv. they all turn to watch.
john madden
 i mean, it's clear to me that
it was a good hold. finkle just
booted it.
einhorn
 the laces weren't out. the laces
weren't out!!
einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in madden's forehead. ace uses the moment to 
smack the gun out of her hand.
a huge, no-holds-barred fight ensues. ace and einhorn punch each other about the 
face and stomach.
einhorn throws a punch at ace. ace goes down.
einhorn goes for the loose gun. ace leaps and tackles her.
they both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. marino struggles all the 
while trying to get free.
einhorn kicks ace. he flies into marino.
marino
 having a little trouble with the
lady, ace?
ace
(out of breath)
 you don't understand, she's a 
einhorn grabs ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face.
meanwhile, cops start arriving, swat team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight 
continues. they try but can't get a bead on ace as the two roll around on the floor.
more punches. they fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. to the amazement of the swat 
team, ace and einhorn slug it out as equals.
aguado
(caught up)
 get him, lois!
now they crash through a plate glass window together. ace gets to his knees first and wobbles 
toward the gun. it's the first clear shot the swat team has had.
einhorn
(screaming)
 shoot him! shoot him!
we all hear the guns cocked. we see ace in the rifle sights. we see fingers twitch on triggers.
a loud voice comes from off camera.
emilio
 don't shoot! hold your fire!
melissa is holding emilio's gun under his chin.
melissa
 put down your guns or this cop
gets it!
the swat team hesitates.
melissa (cont'd)
 i mean it!!
much to emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.
emilio
(whispers to melissa)
 ah melissa? that's a hair
trigger.
(loud to cops)
 she's not joking!
the swat team leader signals his men. they lower their guns. einhorn gets back to her feet.
einhorn
 he kidnapped snowflake. he killed
roger podacter, and he was about
to kill dan marino and me!
ace
 ho, ho! fiction can be fun! but
i find the reference section much
more enlightening.
(doing his best clarence darrow)
 for instance, if you were to look
up 'professional football's all
time bonehead plays', you might
read about a miami dolphin kicker
named ray finkle, who missed a
twenty-six yard field goal in the
closing seconds of super bowl
seventeen.
(in one breath)
 what you wouldn't read about is
how ray finkle lost his mind, and
was committed to a mental
institute, only to escape and join
the police force under the assumed
identity of a missing hker,
seducing her way to the top, in a
diabolical plan to get even with
dan marino whom he blamed for the
entire thing!!!
ace gasps for air. everyone is totally confused.
aguado
 what the hell are you trying to
say?
ace
 she's not lois einhorn! she's ray
finkle! she's a man!
einhorn
 he's lying! shoot him!
ace walks over to her.
ace
 let's just see who's lying. would
a real woman have to wear one of
these?
ace dramatically pulls at einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. einhorn's head flies back. the hair is 
real. ace keeps tugging it.
the swat team ready themselves.
ace (cont'd)
 boy, that's really on there! but
tell me this: would a real woman
be missing these?!
ace rips open einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.
the sharp shooters are tensing. ace is laughing nervously now.
ace
 ha, ha, ha! that kind of surgery
can be done over the weekend! but
i doubt if she could find the time
during her busy schedule to get
rid of mr. knish!!
ace rips off einhorn's skirt. einhorn now stands there fully nude. she appears to be the perfect 
figure of a woman.
ace
 oooh boy.
ace looks at melissa and emilio and shrugs his shoulders. then, just when it seems all is lost, dan 
marino who is back behind einhorn, motions for ace to come over.
marino
 psst ace. come here.
ace
(to everyone)
 could you excuse me just a second.
ace goes to dan. melissa still holds emilio hostage.
einhorn
 shoot him. shoot him, now!!
melissa
(to cops)
 don't anybody make a move!
marino whispers something in his ear. ace looks confident again. he once more addresses the 
crowd.
ace
 ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed
colleague mr. marino, has just
brought some new evidence to my
attention. now, history has
certainly shown that even the most
intuitive criminal minds can be
wrong, from time to time. but, if
i have been mistaken if the
lieutenant is indeed a woman
then my friends, she is suffering
from the worst case of hemorrhoids
i have ever seen!!!
ace spins einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that finkle 
has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (and if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)
everyone gasps. close up on einhorn/finkle. he finally drops the facade.
finkle
(deepest voice possible)
 it was marino's fault. the laces
were in.
(breaking down now)
 they were in!!!
quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. then emilio spits.
then close on marino spitting. they all have kissed her/him/it. even snowflake blows his 
spout.
ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.
ace
 somebody read it its rights.
suddenly, finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at ace.
finkle
 die animal boyyyyy!!!
thinking fast ace sidesteps finkle and sends him head first into snowflake's makeshift tank. after 
a few seconds finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.
finkle
(gasping for air)
 help i can't swim!!!
finkle goes under again. we see him under water sinking down.
snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls finkle gently to the side 
of the pool. finkle lies there exhausted.
ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 afc championship ring from finkle's finger. we 
see that it's the ring with the missing stone. ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. it's a 
perfect fit.
ace
 llloooser! lloo hoo serr herr
herr!!!
melissa is still holding the gun on emilio.
emilio
 melissa you can give me back my
gun now.
melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. she hands it to emilio and faints in his arms.
now aguado appears beside ace.
aguado
 i don't know how you did it,
ventura but that was damn good
police work. alright guys, let's
wrap this up!
