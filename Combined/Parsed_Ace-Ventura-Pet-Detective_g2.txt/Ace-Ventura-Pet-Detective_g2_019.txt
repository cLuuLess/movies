ext. roof of house - same time
close on ace - cooing like a pigeon. widen to reveal, ace precariously perched on the 
roof of a two story building. he is four feet away from "the" pigeon. ater a beat, he makes a 
mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.
ace
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
the bird makes a clean getaway. unable to stop his momentum, ace flies past the edge of the 
building and slides down the side of the roof.
