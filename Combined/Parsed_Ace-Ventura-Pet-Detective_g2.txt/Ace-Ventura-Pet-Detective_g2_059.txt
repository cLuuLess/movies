ext. podacter's balcony - cont
ace examines the area. einhorn is in hot pursuit.
einhorn
 oh, so, you don't think this in an
obvious suicide, mr. pet
detective?
ace
 well, i wouldn't say that. lord
knows, there is plenty of evidence
here to support your theory,
except of course that spot of
blood on the balcony.
on the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.
einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. they look down.
ace
 may i tell you what i think
happened? alrighty then!
ace moves as he talks.
ace
 roger podacter went out after
work. he had a few drinks, and he
came home. but he wasn't alone. 
someone was with him in this
apartment. there was a struggle,
and then roger podacter was thrown
over that balcony. roger podacter
didn't commit suicide. he was
murdered.
a beat as everyone considers this.
einhorn
 well, that's a very entertaining
story, but real detectives have to
worry about that little thing
lawyers call evidence.
ace picks up a lottery ticket on podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.
ace
 let's take a trip to clue
corner, shall we? can anyone tell
me why a man buys a lottery ticket
on the day he is going to commit
suicide? or why the family pet,
suffering from acute canine
trauma, clawed at the bedroom door
until his paws bled? how about
the blood on the railing? i'll
bet if we put our thinking caps on
we'll see that it was the result
of the struggle that took place
inside this apartment while mr.
podacter was still alive!
(singing)
 next time you don't have a clue
come on back to clue corner! boop!
everyone looks to einhorn.
einhorn
 not a bad try for a pet detective,
but not near conclusive enough for
us real investigators.
(beat)
 first, people buy lottery tickets
everyday. it's a habit. it
doesn't prove a thing. second,
the dog wasn't suffering from
canine trauma, he was suffering
from bladder trauma. sergeant
neilson found a piss stain as big
as lake huron near the bed. and
third, the blood on the railing.
simple. he doesn't jump far
enough and whacks his head. a
fact confirmed by the paramedics
who found cuts on his scalp, with
traces of a white chalky
substance. i.e. plaster from the
balcony.
einhorn shows ace the paramedics report. everyone is impressed with einhorn.
einhorn
 so much for your murder, ventura.
aguado
 uh oh, i think i heard a toilet
flush. maybe someone lost their
turtle?
everyone has a laugh. ace looks beaten.
ace
 well, maybe i'm just a little out
of my league, here. einhorn
ace holds out his hand, einhorn shakes it.
ace
 good work.
ace and melissa head for the door.
ace
 oh, there is just one more thing,
lieutenant.
(re: the neighbor)
 this man is roger podacter's
neighbor. he lives across the
hall. he said he heard a scream,
is that right, sir?
the neighbor nods. ace turns to the apartment manager.
ace
 and you said you had to open the
balcony door when you keyed into
the room?
manager
 that's right.
ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.
ace
 you're certain you had to open
this door?
she nods.
einhorn
 what's the point, ventura?
ace
 only this
aaaaaaawwwwwwwwwww
ace sustains an incredible pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door 
between them. when the door is closed nothing can be heard.
ace
(tapping the door)
 this is double paned, sound-
proofed glass. there's no way
this neighbor could have heard
podacter scream on the way down
with this door shut. the scream
he heard came from inside this
apartment, before podacter was
thrown over the railing! and the
muderer closed the door before he
left!
(celebrates insanely)
 yes! yesss! i have exorcised the
demons!
(a la poltergeist)
 this house is clear.
