     ext. desert - day

     doc gets out of the stopped humvee, shaken, and walks around.

                         doc
               i'm all right, i'm cool.

     he lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.
     archie gets out and walks around, agitated, clearly upset.

                         archie gates
               what is the art of war, because it
               is not for killing people, it's a
               stratagem to give life to many by
               killing the evil perpetrated by a
               few -- i am burning up in this
               goddamn suit --

     he angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched
     green t-shirt underneath.  troy and vig guzzle water.

                         archie gates
               discriminating use of violence as
               a last resort, and even then,
               carefully, surgically, that's what
               i learned, that's what i'm good
               at. but now they underestimate all
               this, bomb the same towns for six
               weeks  and still leave the scumbag
               dictator to starve and butcher his
               own people.

     the others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits.

                         troy
                      (agitated)
               i don't even know what happened
               back there. civilians were
               spitting on their own soldiers;
               the soldiers were shooting the
               civilians and ignoring us --

                         doc
               they already surrendered to us.
               now they're after shiites.

                         vig
               what exactly is a shiite?

                         archie gates
               they make up the ethnic majority
               but they don't have any power.
               when bush pulled us out, he told
               them to start a civil war to bring
               saddam down, and now they're
               getting wasted.

                         vig
                      (totally puzzled)
               the civil war? how could it be the
               civil war?

     fantasy - stock footage: union soldiers fight dixie rebels

     back to the scene

     vig looks puzzled.

                         troy
               it's a war inside the same
               country, conrad. that's a civil
               war.

     archie chucks each of them marine uniforms without name tags
     which everyone puts on, except troy.

                         archie gates
               put these on, we are now u.s.
               marines.

                         troy
               i can't do this, ok? because i've
               got a family and if i shit in a
               bag the rest of my life cuz i got
               shot after the war's already over
               that would be pretty fucking
               stupid, wouldn't it?

                         archie gates
               what is the most important thing
               in life?

                         troy
               what the fuck are you talking
               about?

                         archie gates
               what is it?

                         troy
               did you hear anything i said.

                         vig
               respect is the most important.

                         archie gates
               too dependent on other people.

                         doc
               money.

                         archie gates
               comes and goes, man.

                         troy
               what is this bullshit?

                         doc
               what's the most important thing?

                         archie gates
               necessity. that's what dictates
               what will happen at any given time
               in life. necessity says we don't
               spend american lives taking out
               saddam,  which leaves saddam the
               necessity of taking out the
               shiites so he can stay in power,
               which leaves us to take the gold.

                         troy
               we could've been shot.

                         archie gates
               did you notice they didn't touch
               us?  we decimated their entire
               country. they're scared shitless
               of us. [looks at his watch]
               there's time to try another
               bunker. i say we go.

                         doc
               let's do it.

                         vig
               rock and roll.

                         troy
               ok. and i'll be wearing
               fashionable kevlar. as a necessity.

     he pulls a vest out of the humvee.
