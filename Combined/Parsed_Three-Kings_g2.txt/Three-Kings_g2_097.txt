     ext. front of bunker - day

     12 iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 shiite
     riflemen with doc fire on them. two iraqis go down, with only
     the sound of bullets piercing their flesh.

     6 iraqis run for it, into the desert. 2 iraqis throw their
     hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds a
     stack of new levis. doc raises a hand to stop his shiite
     gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 iraqis fire
     back -- the shiite next to doc is hit in the face.

                         doc
               stop shooting, what's the matter
               with you?

     he reaches out and holds the rifle of a shiite. everyone
     stops firing, slowly the iraqis drop their guns. doc has wet
     his pants.

     archie runs up from the right, grabs doc's arm and they run
     past surrendering iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance.
     of the bunker. imam takes cover on the side of the bunker
     while shiites and iraqis aim at each other.

     vig approaches cautiously from the desert, hears an aircraft,
     and looks up. an iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens
     fire with machine guns --

                         vig
               shit.

     vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by
     machine gun fire from the chopper. shiites fire rifles up at
     the chopper.
