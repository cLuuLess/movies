     ext. iraqi side of the border

     archie helps troy as they walk three abreast with doc.

     choppers are heard in the distance. they grow louder. imam
     turns and looks back. archie turns around and looks.

     six apache choppers approach from the distance

     close dolly archie.

                         archie gates
               double time.

     he lets go of troy and starts jogging toward the border. troy
     cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.
     the shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. doc and
     walter look up also. archie does not.

     havichon in the humvee swings the mounted gun up to the
     choppers as they pass overhead, loud.

     pan up to six apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in
     the 50 yards between archie and the border, blocking his
     path, blowing up dust.

     archie, troy, doc, imam, the shiites turn and wince in the
     blowing sand.

     10 u.s. military police jump from the landing choppers,
     followed by another ten u.s. troops with rifles.

     iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively.

     m.p.s grab archie, troy, and doc, and pull them away from
     the shiites.

     troy shouts over the choppers.

                         troy
               wait.

     u.s. soldiers push the shiites toward the border.

     the shiites, including two who carry vig's body, run toward
     the border unaccompanied by american protection.

                         archie gates
               let them get over the border.

     troy pulls away from mps, resisting arrest.

                         troy
               let them get over, wait --

     plastic handcuffs are put onto troy, behind his back.

                         troy
               i have to reach this --

     archie and doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front --

                         archie gates
               put his cuffs in front.

     he and doc are pulled away from troy.

     iraqi soldiers take the shiites prisoner, grabbing them,
     throwing some to the ground. troy looks over his shoulder at
     this as imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is
     thrown to the ground and dragged.

                         troy
               look what's happening.

     he collapses to one knee.

                         captain van meter
               not our mission, barlow.

     troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs
     prevent him from releasing his valve. troy struggles.

                         troy
               cut my cuffs --

     captain van meter leans down to troy. he shouts over the
     choppers.

                         captain van meter
               you fucked me and you're fucked
               now, so shut your goddamn mouth.

     shiites are lined up in a firing squad.

                         doc
               he's gonna die.

     troy lies on the ground suffocating. archie drags the mp
     holding him as he goes to general horn.

                         archie gates
               goddamn it, ron, give him medical
               attention, don't let him die --


                         general horn
               we are not involved in the shiite
               problem, do you understand
               me? you are awol, you are a
               fugitive, you are under arrest.

                         archie gates
               cut his cuffs.

     general horn walks away as mps stare at troy on the ground,
     concerned.

     a us soldier stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in
     his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade,
     crouches down to troy, exchanges a look with the mp standing
     by, and cuts troy's plastic cuffs. troy reaches with
     difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes.

     archie looks at troy, then up at the border.

     imam and the shiites are lined up in a firing squad. vig's
     body is dropped in the sand.

                         archie gates
               we got the gold.

                         general horn
               what?

                         archie gates
               we got the kuwaiti bullion.

                         general horn
               bullshit.

     archie pulls away from the mps holding him and runs toward
     the lead truck -- where mps grab and wrestle him down.

                         archie gates
               pull that barrel.

                         general horn
               pull it.

     an mp jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold
     bars spill to the sand.

     the general looks at the gold. troy and doc, held in custody,
     watch.  the general makes a 'cut' signal to the choppers --
     and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows quiet.

     the u.s. soldiers -- holding walter and the drivers in
     custody -- stand and watch archie.

                         general horn
               how much do you have?

                         archie gates
               4 tons.

     general horn picks up a gold brick.

                         general horn
               where's it at?

                         troy
               get them over first.

                         archie gates
               they helped us get it, ron. i made
               a deal, and that's soldier's
               honor. you can't fuck them now.

     general horn looks at archie.

                         archie gates
               you can return this gold, be a big
               hero, get another star maybe.

     everyone stares at general horn. after a pause, the general
     fires his pistol into the air.

     iraqi soldiers freeze as they are about to fire on the
     shiites.

                         general horn
               let's go, doug.

     captain van meter and general horn walk 40 yards to the
     frozen iraqi soldiers and the terrified shiites.

     archie, troy, doc in handcuffs with mps, watch.

     walter and the other u.s. soldiers watch from afar as
     captain van meter and general horn walk into the midst of
     iraqi soldiers.

                         general horn
               who's in charge here?

     an older iraqi general steps forward and salutes.

                         general horn
               we have to talk about this
               situation.

     archie, troy, doc, u.s. soldiers watch from a distance.

     archie's pov from afar

     general horn talks to the iraqi general.

     back to the scene

     u.s. soldiers watch.

     troy's pov from afar

     general horn and captain van meter walk back toward them.

     it is quiet. no one says anything.

     pan across paco taping.

                         bill smithson
               in a morbid tableau these men have
               recovered some of the gold bullion
               stolen from kuwait --

                         cathy daitch
               --in violation of american policy,
               saved over a hundred shiite
               refugees while recovering stolen
               kuwaiti gold --

                         general horn
               turn that damn camera off.

     he walks up and forcibly pushes the camera to the ground, van
     meter pushes cathy's camera down.

                         bill smithson
               that's a 75 thousand dollar
               camera --

                         general horn
               what the fuck are they doing here?

                         sargeant
               i thought they were authorized --

                         general horn
               they are not fucking authorized,
               for christ's sake --

     mps take the tapes from the cameras.

                         general horn
               haven't i taken care of you,
               dammit?

     he signals the choppers to start up.

     the chopper engines slowly whine into gear.

                         cathy daitch
               i'm gonna get that tape back.

     general horn walks over to troy, archie, and doc.

                         general horn
               you are under arrest. you are
               going to be court-martialed. and
               you will show us where the bullion
               is right now.

     he walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed.

     pan to troy, archie, doc turn to the border and watch.
     walter, the handcuffed drivers, the mps and other u.s.
     soldiers also watch.

     the shiites are released by the iraqis. they collect
     themselves and gather in a group. the group walks over the
     border and is received by the relief workers.

     troy, archie, doc watch. a u.s. soldier whistles through the
     loud choppers.

                         soldier #10
               yeah.

     then another soldier joins in, whistling and clapping.

     then another soldier, until all twenty u.s.
     soldiers and mps present are whistling and cheering troy,
     archie, and doc as they stand there while the choppers throb.

     50 yards away: imam holds his daughter, on the iran side,
     about to get into a red crescent bus.

     imam and his daughter wave.

     archie raises his handcuffed wrists to wave back; troy and
     doc follow, raising their cuffed hands to wave.

     freeze frame.

     "i get around" by the beach boys kicks on.

                                              cut to

     text over black: troy barlow, archie gates, and doc elgin
     were court-martialed and convicted of disobeying orders and
     the wrongful death of conrad vig.

     they each served eighteen months in a military prison.  bill
     smithson and cathy daitch's testimony resulted in reduced
     sentences.

     troy barlow runs his own carpet company in torrance, cal.
