     int. inner room - day

     a bound, naked shiite man in glasses, clean shaven, sits on
     the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four
     inches deep, filled with water. there is an electric cable
     going into the water. the naked shiite in glasses shakes.

     troy watches archie walk over and yank the cable out.

                         iraqi sargeant
               i am just do my job, buddy.

     archie pauses, then gives the sargeant a backhand that sends
     him flying to the corner. archie steps on the man's wrist,
     takes the pistol out of his hand. troy watches.

     archie turns and sees ten shiites across the room: 3 men, 3
     women, 4 children. the men and women are bound and gagged.

     archie steps toward the shiites, but the interrogator, 35,
     also a captain, steps in his way.

                         interrogator
               these shiite. iraq problem. united
               states is out now.

     archie stares at the interrogator with contempt.

                         interrogator
               we take them outside, so it don't
               bother you, ok, sir? kata fanam.

     the disarmed iraqi sargeant nods and opens a small rear door
     and pushes the shiites out. archie walks back to the main
     room and points his pistol in the captain's face.

                         archie gates
               take us to the basement.
