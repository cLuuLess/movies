     ext. side of bunker

     archie and imam run back to the mercedes, but the car is
     locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat. a gunshot
     from the bunker roof shatters the window of the mercedes,
     setting off the car alarm.

     archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched
     grenade blows the mercedes.
