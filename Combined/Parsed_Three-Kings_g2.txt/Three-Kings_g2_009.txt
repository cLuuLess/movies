     ext. desert camp - wide shot - dawn

     three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they
     run to a motorcycle and side car. walter kickstarts the
     motorcycle. paco the cameraman sits behind walter with a
     video camera. walter's face is painted beige and brown with
     camouflage spots, so is bill smithson's, as he crouches in
     the sidecar and dramatically gives walter the thumb's up.
