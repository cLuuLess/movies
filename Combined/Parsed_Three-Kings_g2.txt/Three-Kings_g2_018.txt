     int. basement of bunker - day

     doc lashes an iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him.

     troy shoots the door lock with his pistol.  then backs up and
     gives it a running shoulder. the door doesn't budge.

                         troy
               shit.

     he holds his shoulder in pain.  archie kicks the door
     repeatedly.  troy joins him, it finally flies open.

                         troy
               freeze.

     troy is embraced by an iraqi soldier, about 25.

                         friendly iraqi
               i am love united states of
               freedom. i am hate saddam.

     troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge
     the iraqi from the bear hug --

                         troy
               ya -- ya -- ha --

     doc points his pistol in the iraqi's face.

                         doc
               let him go.

     the iraqi throws his hands in the air.

                         friendly iraqi
               no problem, my friend.

     archie goes to a series of wooden crates the size of file
     cabinets, where doc helps archie take off his back pack.
     archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both
     attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is
     filled with hundreds of kuwaiti passports.

                         friendly iraqi
               you look for the chemical weapon?

                         troy
               no. we look for the gold.

     they use the power tools to open the second crate -- also
     filled with hundreds of passports.

                         archie gates
               where's the gold?

                         friendly iraqi
               they move the gold.

     archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the iraqi,
     who says nothing.

                         doc
               kill him.

                         archie gates
               not yet.

                         troy
               kill him now.

     they point their guns. it's a show. archie holds the map.

                         archie gates
               where?

                         friendly iraqi
                      (points to map)
               this bunker. i'll take you.
