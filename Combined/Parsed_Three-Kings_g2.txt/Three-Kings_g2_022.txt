     ext. marsh

     the motorcycle is stopped by the marsh. siberian pelicans fly
     all around. many lie dead on the ground.  bill smithson paces
     with a cell phone.

                         bill smithson
                      (on cell phone)
               i'm at some goddamn marsh, all
               we've seen are russian cranes.

                         walter

                      (on the cell phone)
               i think the saddam story goes more
               for the jugular, journalistically
               speaking, al. let's grow some
               balls and do the shiite uprising,
               for christ's sake.

     bill smithson closes the cell phone.

                         bill smithson
               we're going north to do the
               shiites.

                         walter
               i thought the gold was the hot
               spot.

                         bill smithson
               karbala's the new hotspot, and
               i'm driving.

                         walter
               military regulations, you cannot
               drive.

     smithson mounts the bike. the cameraman sits on back. walter
     points his pistol at smithson.

                         walter
               get off the vehicle, sir.

     smithson starts the bike.

                         walter
               don't make me shoot you, sir.

     the bike pulls out, leaving him behind. he runs after the
     bike and jumps into the side car.
