     ext. desert - later

     they sit in the humvee and hold their pistols ready.

                         archie gates
               we'll say the cow is the primary
               guard outside the bunker. we pull
               up fast, and stop short.

                         troy
               got it.

                         archie gates
               and -- go.

     the cow stares as the humvee pulls up to it fast. troy and
     doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow --

     the cow steps back, and explodes.

     troy and doc stand splattered with cow entrails. the cow's
     head lands with a thud on the hood of the humvee.

                         archie gates
               who's hurt?

                         doc
               it's all cow, i think.

                         vig
               yeah, it's all cow.

     he picks cow entrails off himself.

                         doc
               they said this was swept for mines.

                         archie gates
               mines are forever, doc. they never
               get all of 'em.

                         troy
                      (low murmur)
               'if you could, help me rhonda,
               help help me rhonda --'

     archie watches troy.

                         archie gates
               did you guys see any action at all?

                         vig
               only night bombing on cnn, except
               for troy's supercool shooting that
               guy in the neck--

     archie takes vig's big pistol and empties the shells and puts
     them into his pocket.

                         archie gates
               is sepsis cool?

                         vig
               what's sepsis?

                         doc
               infection of the blood.

                         archie gates
               as in septic tank, because that's
               what happens when a bullet hits
               you. the lead tears in there --

     fantasy - int. stomach muscle and tissue

     slow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity --

                         archie gates (o.s.)
               makes a cavity of dead tissue that
               closes down in a convulsive motion
               typical of all gunshot wounds. the
               cavity fills up with bile and
               bacteria and you're fucked.

     bile fluid fills the cavity.

     back to the scene

                         archie gates
               but other than a wound that
               blinds, paralyzes, or castrates,
               the worst wound i've ever seen is
               something called tension pneumo
               thorax --

                         doc
               i heard something about that --

                         vig
               tension pneumo what?

                         archie gates
               a bullet, or a blade doesn't kill
               you, but makes a little hole in
               the lung, so every time you
               breathe, a little air leaks into
               the chest cavity, which starts to
               fill up like a balloon. and that
               balloon starts to push your organs
               to the side, crushing your lung,
               your liver, your heart. your own
               breathing kills you, one breath at
               a time -- kinda like a job you
               can't stand or a bad lie you once
               told.

                         doc
               that's not fatal, they can stop it.

                         archie gates
               if you know how to make another
               little hole in the chest to let
               the air out, just like you would
               with an overinflated tire.

     they look at archie, scared by this.

                         troy
               can we play the beach boys when we
               go in?

                         doc
               the goddamn beach boys.

                         troy
               i'm not ashamed of liking the
               beach boys. it calms me down.
               better than mozart.

                         archie gates
               bach.
