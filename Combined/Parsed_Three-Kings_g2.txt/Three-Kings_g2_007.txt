     ext. television truck - day

     archie is faced by an older two star general (general pye),
     a younger one star general (general horn).

                         general pye
               this is not the way we service the
               media, major. stop her --

     whip pan to cathy runs away as she dresses, mps grab her.

                         mp
               you are in violation of code 37d,
               grinding major gates.

     they let her go. soldiers in gas suits laugh.

                         archie gates
               you guys have no manners
               whatsoever --

     bill smithson runs up, agitated.

                         bill smithson
               i told you he was with her --

                         general pye
               we're handling this, ok?

     the mp pushes smithson away.

                         bill smithson
               i wanted help with the gold story,
               and he took off on me--

                         archie gates
               that's a lot of bullshit.

     smithson is walked away. archie pulls his pants up.

                         general pye
               i give you a prestige job in the
               media war of the century and the
               guy feels neglected.

                         archie gates
               i'm helping him plenty with his
               big celebration feature -- where
               did you get this fucking star?

     archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of general
     horn's collar, with its one star.

                         general horn
               they made me a general, pal.

                         archie gates
               for what? i don't even know what
               we did over here, but schwartzkopf
               gets a book deal, you get a star,
               powell gets to be fucking
               president--

                         general horn
               are you high? this is a huge win
               for us.

                         archie gates
               running the press pool's a real
               big win for me.

                         general pye
               you want us to kill more americans
               to occupy iraq?

                         archie gates
               i'm just saying it's ironic,
               that's all.

                         general horn
               what the fuck is ironic?

                         archie gates
               we got the biggest army in the
               world here but iraq still has the
               d-bag dictator in power, but
               that's how the world works i guess.

                         general pye
               just take care of smithson and
               maybe he'll hook you up to consult
               on movies.

                         general horn
               it's either that or be a security
               guard when you retire.

                         archie gates
               fuck you, ron.

                         general horn
               i'm a general now, you can't say
               fuck you to me.

                         archie gates
               ok, sir, but there's another thing
               i'd like to say, if you don't mind.

                         general horn
               go right ahead, colonel.

     archie leans wild-eyed into horn's face and whispers --

                         archie gates
               fuuuuuck yooouuuu, ronnnnn.
