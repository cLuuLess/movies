               anybody shot in this war.

     he holds the camera out.

                         soldier #4
               if he shot the guy, it's up to him.

               it's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. it's the enemy.

               troy's enemy, yours for twenty.

     soldiers get their cash out, troy takes it.

               accept no substitute, this is the
               real thing, oh, jesus [winces] --

     at arm's length.

               no free pictures, motherfucker.

     vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll
     down the sand berm.

     "i just want to celebrate" by rare earth comes on loud.

     troy walks away holding his temple in pain; soldiers gather
     to stare at the dead iraqi, getting their cameras out.
