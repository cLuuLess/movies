     shiite women and children chant and pray around vig's corpse
     as it lies in the open trunk of the jaguar. archie, troy and
     doc stand together watching. troy and doc do a muted version
     of vig's karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse.

                         troy
               he's got no family.

     archie sadly takes vig's big pistol from vig's clenched hand.

                         archie gates
               we're his family now.

                         doc
               he wanted to go to one of those
               shrines.

                         imam
               kajatar in iran. we can take him.

     archie takes vig's glasses off.

                         archie gates
               good. take him.
