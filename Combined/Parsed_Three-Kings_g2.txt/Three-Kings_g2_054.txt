     int. tunnel - day

     chaos. people choking and vomiting. gas lanterns swing. the
     tunnel is 6 feet tall. buckets are passed, filled with oiled
     rags that people use to wipe their faces. archie takes a
     dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth.

                         vig
               we have to go back. we can't leave
               him there.

     vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding.

                         archie gates
               we have to wait until it clears.

                         vig
               you made the choice and we lost
               troy --

                         archie gates
               i had no choice.

                         vig
               you had a choice.

                         archie gates
               i had no fucking choice.

     he screams at vig, who looks scared.

                         archie gates
               i can't walk away from a crime
               like that and take the gold and
               live my life like nothing
               happened, and if you can, then i
               hope you die right now.

     vig starts crying. doc hands a bandage to archie, who puts it
     over vig's wounded eye socket.

                         vig
               what about troy? what choice does
               he have now?

     pan across the man in glasses wipes his daughter's face.
