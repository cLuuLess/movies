     ext. desert -  day

     vig and the six shiites frantically search for cover.

     the chopper fires and one of the shiites running with vig is
     hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into vig,
     who goes down, faking it.

     vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead shiite on
     top of him while the chopper hovers above.

                         vig
               jesus god, i don't wanna get hit,
               please jesus, watch over me --
