     int. minaret

     a rug is pulled off the old stone floor, a panel is lifted.
     old pistols and rifles are pulled out.

     doc and vig load and handle the old pistols.

                         archie gates
               did we save anything from the
               humvee?

                         doc
               this bag.

     archie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up
     pack. he looks at doc as if to say "great."

     later

     archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of
     light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small
     nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the
     end of the ball. another ball-bomb just like it has already
     been constructed.
