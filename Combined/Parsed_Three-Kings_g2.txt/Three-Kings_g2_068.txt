     int. large room of minaret - day

     two dozen people are laying down, being treated by shiite
     clerics in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters.

     at the end of the hall, archie grits his teeth in pain as a
     cleric uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his
     infected wound. archie screams in pain.

     doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face.

                         doc
               i'm ok. i'm cool. i'm a survivor.

     a shiite changes vig's bloody bandage, while a dead body is
     laid next to vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant.

                         vig
               is that guy dead? where you gonna
               put him?

                         shiite cleric
               a shrine.

                         vig
               what kind of shrine ya'll got?

                         shiite cleric
               shrine that wash 700 year of sin.

                         vig
               hey, that's a pretty good shrine,
               right, doc?

     doc stares at vig.

                         vig
               i'm sorry i hit you, man. i was
               scared for troy, i don't want
               nothing to happen to him, he's my
               friend. doc? come on, man, i know
               you was comin' to help me --

     vig reaches out blindly for doc's hand. doc looks for a
     moment at vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it.
     they remain silent for a moment, hands clasped.

                         vig
               maybe we got kicked out of the
               ring of jesus fire, on account of
               stealing.

                         doc
               that's not how it works.

                         vig
               how does it work?

                         doc
               i take care of what jesus puts in
               front of me. that's what we did
               with the gold.

                         vig
               what about now?

                         doc
               i'm gonna see.

     archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects vig's face.

                         archie gates
               how you doing, conrad?

                         vig
               i'm good to go, chief.

                         archie gates
               let's check the suitcases.

     archie, doc, and vig check the vuitton suitcases, opening
     them, looking at the gold, shutting them.

     pan to children in bandages watch archie inventory the gold.

                         doc
               we're missing 28.

                         archie gates
               that leaves 92 suitcases, five
               bars each --

     they think.

                         archie gates
               23 million dollars. not bad for a
               disaster, provided we can find
               barlow, get back before dark and
               not get busted.

     he looks at doc and vig.

                         archie gates
               it was my choice today. so you can
               head back if you want. i'll find
               barlow myself.

                         doc
               what about the gold?

                         archie gates
               take what you can carry. try to
               find a vehicle. bury what you have
               outside camp. be careful about it.

     they look at archie.

                         vig
               i want to find troy.

     doc thinks.

                         doc
               i'm in.

                         archie gates
               ok, where does that leave us? we
               don't have any water, we're
               dehydrated. you got a radio here?

     the shiite man in glasses puts oils on his little girl's face.

                         archie gates
               how is she?

     the shiite man in glasses does not answer.

                         doc
               how -- is -- your -- little
               girl?

     vig wears glasses over his eye bandage; he mimes the girl.

                         vig
               broken -- arms. girl.

                         man in glasses
               she's traumatized, what the fuck
               do you expect?

     they look at him, surprised.

                         man in glasses
               i went to b-school at bowling
               green.

                         vig
               what's b-school? is that like
               terrorist training?

                         doc
               business school, conrad.

                         man in glasses
               i came back to open a couple of
               hotels near karbala. i'm almost in
               the black when saddam starts this
               stupid fucking war and you guys
               bomb the shit out of my cafes. now
               we try to get rid of saddam, bush
               leaves us twisting in the wind, un-
               be-fucking-lievable man.

                         archie gates
               you got a radio?

                         man in glasses
               no radio. no water.

     he wipes bits of white foam from the corners of his mouth.

                         archie gates
               where's barlow?

                         man in glasses
               they got him, i saw it happen. and
               they won't take him back to the
               same place.

                         archie gates
               where would they take him?

                         man in glasses
               oasis bunker. it's full of
               saddam's hard core guys.

                         doc
               where's that?

                         man in glasses
               like 17 - 18 klicks from here.

                         archie gates
               take us there.

                         man in glasses
               we got no wheels.

                         archie gates
               we'll walk until we find some.

                         man in glasses
               why don't you call in the marines?

                         archie gates
               with what? we don't have a radio.

                         man in glasses
               ok, we'll find a vehicle. you
               drive back to get the choppers,
               they fly in to get your man.

     doc and vig look at archie.

                         archie gates
               we can't do that.

                         man in glasses
               why not? you got a huge army here.

                         archie gates
               we're not supposed to be involved
               with shiites. we killed iraqi
               soldiers. we broke the peace-
               accord.

                         man in glasses
               tell them it happened when you
               reclaimed the gold. don't tell
               them it was about us.

                         archie gates
               they'd find out, we'd go to jail.

                         man in glasses
               you know what i think? i think
               maybe you're boosting the gold.
               that's what i think.

     archie looks at him.

                         archie gates
               you're wrong.

                         man in glasses
               they got half a million men in the
               desert, they send four guys to
               pick up all this bullion? i don't
               think so.

     archie looks at vig and doc.

                         archie gates
               we need to find our man. how much
               do you want to take us there?

                         man in glasses
               fifteen suitcases.

                         archie gates
               that's too much.

                         vig
               give it to him. we've got a lot.

                         archie gates
               we're gonna need it to buy our way
               back today, so we better spend it
               wisely. i'll give you eight.

                         man in glasses
               you need some guns, right? you
               lost your gear.

                         archie gates
               yeah, we need some guns.

                         man in glasses
               you need some fighters, too. i
               mean, you can try to take oasis on
               your own, but look at these
               grunts --

     doc and vig look pissed. archie's arm is in pain.

                         archie gates
               yeah, ok, we need some fighters.

                         man in glasses
               so that's worth more than eight
               suitcases.

                         archie gates
               ten.

                         man in glasses
               fifteen.

     archie looks at him.

                         archie gates
               that's four million dollars.

                         man in glasses
               i think we need it more than you,
               john doe, don't you?

     he extends his hand. they shake.

                         archie gates
               archie gates.

                         imam (man in glasses)
               imam katar. i'll give you back
               five suitcases to get us over the
               iranian border.

                         archie gates
               what?

                         imam
               we gotta get to a refugee camp or
               we're dead. the camps are in iran.

                         doc
               we can't go to the iranian border.

                         imam
               then we don't have a deal.

                         vig
               give me a fucking break, man.

                         doc
               we saved your life.

                         imam
               and we saved yours.

                         archie gates
               we lost a man for you.

                         imam
               what good is it if you leave us to
               get wasted? the big army of
               democracy beats the ugly dictator,
               saves the rich kuwaitis, but you
               go to jail if you help us escape
               the same dictator.  you saw what
               happened to my wife. look at my
               daughter.

     archie looks around. he sees imam's daughter, other bandaged
     children looking at him. a few mothers.

                         archie gates
               who's going?

                         imam
               everyone but the priests. that's
               55.

                         vig
               fuck it. we'll find this place on
               our own.

                         imam
               it's not on a map. you can look.

                         doc
               somebody else will take us.

     doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up

                         doc
               who will take us to oasis bunker?

     fifty shiites turn and look at him silently. doc dumps a
     whole suitcase of gold bars. imam translates.

                         imam
               jarat yalam fantam uraz.

     people stare at the gold and say nothing.

                         imam
               i don't think so.

                         vig
               this is a human life we're talking
               about.

                         imam
                      (laughs)
               tell me about it.

     his daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter
     becomes scary, hysterical and imam tries to hold her still
     and she won't stop as archie, doc, vig watch.
