     int.  gattaca - corridor.  day.

     walking back along one of the long, glass-walled corridors,
     jerome becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex -
     or to be more precise, a lack of noise.  the incessant tapping
     of computer keys has stilled.

     as jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor, we see the
     reflection of his face, deep in thought.

                           jerome (vo)
              the most unremarkable of events.  jerome
              morrow, navigator first class, is only days
              away from a one-year manned mission to 951
              gaspra in the outer asteroid belt.  nothing so
              unique in that.  last year over one thousand
              citizens from every walk of life embarked on
              some space mission or other.  besides,
              selection for jerome was virtually guaranteed
              at birth.  he is blessed with all the physical
              and intellectual gifts required for such an
              arduous undertaking, a genetic quotient second
              to none.

     jerome's gaze drifts to the sky.

                           jerome (vo)
              no, there is truly nothing remarkable about
              the progress of jerome morrow, except that i
              am not jerome morrow.
