     ext.  a field.  dawn.

     a light shroud of mist hangs over the trees that encircle a
     grassy clearing beyond irene's building.  something lies in the
     center of the clearing.

     we jump-cut to an extreme close up of two or three blades of
     grass.  bristles rain down on the blades.  withotu access to his
     incinerator, the crouched, naked figure of jerome disposes of
     his whiskers, skin and hair in an open field.  his clothes sit
     in a neat pile at his side.  he pours glycolic acid over his
     body and scrubs at his back, feet and hands with a brush.  there
     is a haunted, tortured look in his eyes as he tries desperately
     to rid himself of himself.
