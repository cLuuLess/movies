     ext.  gattaca - garden.  lunchtime.

     in gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens jerome, dressed and
     recovered from his ordeal, joins his colleagues for lunch at one
     of the umbrella-covered tables.  while most of the others pick
     at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication,
     jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray.

     the sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from
     his colleagues.  jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by
     liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat.

     however when jerome looks over towards irene, she avoids eye
     contact.  when she abruptly gets up and leaves, jerome follows -
     thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby
     trashcan.  a janitor reaches for the napkin.  it is the old
     janitor, caesar, from jerome's former life.

                           caesar
              i'll take care of that for you, mr morrow.

     the two men exchange a conspiratorial smile.
