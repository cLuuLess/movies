     ext.  gattaca.  dawn.

     a pick-up truck, packed with a cleaning crew, pulls into the
     rear of the building.  they are no longer strictly the migrant
     workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of
     ethnicities - all members of a genetic underclass that does not
     discriminate by race.

     as vincent exits the truck and turns towards the camera, we
     discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to
     know as jerome.  the only visible differences are the glasses he
     wears and his hair, still naturally dark.

                           jerome (vo)
              like many others in my situation, i moved
              around a lot in the next few years, getting
              work where i could.  i must have cleaned
              half the toilets in the state.

     we follow vincent through the course of a day.  cleaning
     restrooms, toilets, picking up litter, sweeping, washing
     windows - gazing at the aerospace workers below.  the building
     is part of the gattaca facility, located near a shuttle launch
     site.  throughout the day, with the regularity of 747's, vincent
     spies rocket ships in the distance, launching into the sky.
     jerome's is the only head that turns and looks up.  long after
     the sun has set, vincent is still working.  another rocket ship
     lights up the darkness.  vincent gazes forlornly into the
     heavens.
