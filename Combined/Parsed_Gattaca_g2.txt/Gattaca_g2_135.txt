     int.  gattaca - janitor's locker room.  night.

     caesar, the old janitor, enters the locker room.  he is about to
     wearily open his locker when he senses another presence in the
     room.

     he turns to find jerome sitting there on a bench.  although
     clearly delighted, caesar tries to disguise his pleasure.

                           caesar
              so you've finally seen sense and come back
              to your old job, vincent.

                           jerome
              not yet, i'm afraid.

                           caesar
              no?  what's keeping you?

                           jerome
              i guess i'm a slow learner.

                           caesar
              i guess so.
                      (looking up through the
                      small window)
              well, while you're up there, maybe you could
              tidy the place up a bit.

                           jerome
              i'll see what i can do.

     the two men embrace, caesar breaking off before jerome.

                           caesar
              and don't go getting everybody lost out there.
              you'll give us a bad name.  you won't have
              me to keep an eye on you, you know.

                           jerome
                      (glancing to caesar's locker)
              by the way, i left some trash in your locker.

                           caesar
                      (happy to oblige)
              i'll take care of it.

     jerome departs.  caesar watches him go and turns back to his
     locker.  he opens it to find a brand new, high-tech telescope
     sitting inside.

     the old janitor gets over his surprise and beams broadly -
     he looks back in jerome's direction but he has gone.  the
     old janitor cannot help himself and reverently reaches for the
     telescope's eyepiece.
