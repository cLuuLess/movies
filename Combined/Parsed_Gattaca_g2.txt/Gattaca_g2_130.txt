     int.  condo - staircase.  day.

     jerome catches the merest glimpse of the investigator and
     detective hugo before he slips behind a doorway in eugene's
     condominium.

     jerome anxiously regards eugene's empty wheelchair sitting
     there.  on the stairs, hugo's phone rings.

                           detective hugo (oc)
                      (into phone, increasingly encouraged)
              yes?...yes...yes...

     the investigator is already at the foot of the stairs in
     eugene's condo when the detective calls to him.

                           detective
                      (urgent, to investigator)
              come quickly.  we have him.

     the investigator's eyes light up.  he retraces his steps
     up the staircase after detective hugo.
