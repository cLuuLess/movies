     2-year-old jerome (referred to by his given name of "vincent"
     for most of the following flashback) running with a toy rocket
     falls more in clumsiness than fatigue.  maria suddenly whisks up
     the toddler.

                           maria
                      (hysterical)
              oh, vincent, vincent, vincent...i can't let
              you out of my sight.

     maria frantically listens to her young son's heartbeat.  for
     his part, vincent appears surprised by the attention.  maria
     places a portable oxygen mask over vincent's mouth.

                           jerome (vo)
              i was born vincent antonio luca.  and from
              an early age i came to think of myself as
              others thought of me - chronically ill.
              every skinned knee and runny nose treated
              as if it were life-threatening.
