     int.  irene's apartment.  later that morning.

     back in the bedroom, jerome, partially dressed, holds irene
     in bed.  she softly touches the scars on his shins.

                           irene
                      (referring to the shins)
              what happened?

                           jerome
              you remember the '99 chrysler lebaron?
              it's the exact height of the front fender.
                      (shrugs)
              looked right instead of left.

                           irene
                      (comforted by the thought)
              so you're not so smart after all.
                      (awkward about raising the subject)
              i want you to know--if it ever came to it--
              i'd be willing to get an ovum from the egg
              bank.  in fact, i'd rather use a donor egg--
                      (quickly covering herself again)
              --if it came to it.

                           jerome
              but "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--
                      (searching for an appropriate body part)
              --nose.
                      (stroking her face)
              how perfect does your child have to be?

                           irene
                      (mildly irritated by what she
                      perceives as his mocking)
              you hypocrite.  do you think for one moment
              you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't
              for who you are--what you are?  don't you get
              any satisfaction knowing that your children
              will be able to live to a ripe old age unless
              they do something foolish?

                           jerome
              that's precisely what scaresme--that they
              won't do anything foolish or courageous or
              anything--worth a goddamn.

     irene is taken aback by jerome's passion, regarding him in a new
     light.
