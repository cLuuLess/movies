     ext.  beach.  dawn.

     jerome and irene huddle beneath an overcoat as the sun crests
     the horizon, staining the sky with an ochre blush.

                           irene
              what did i tell you?

     jerome nods.  however, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing
     but an out-of-focus, abstract ink blot.

                           irene
              i envy you, jerome.

                           jerome
              you'll be next.

                           irene
              i don't think so.  the only trip i'll make
              in space is around the sun--
                      (letting a handful of sand
                      slip through her fingers)
              --on this satellite right here.

     irene turns to jerome.

                           irene
                      (blurting out what's really on her mind)
              --listen, i don't want to waste your time
              and i really don't want you to waste mine.
              i don't know what you're after but i have
              a feeling i'm not it.

     irene suddenly takes jerome's hand and puts it up her
     sweater, onto her breast.  although taken aback, jerome makes
     no effort to withdraw his hand.

                           irene
                      (enjoying his unease)
              it's here.  my heart.
                      (adding quickly)
              i'm careful--weekly check-ups.  i'm on a
              drug maintenance program, blood thinners,
              diet--
                      (slowly removing his hand)
              i just want you to know what you'd be getting
              yourself into.

                           jerome
              what exactly is wrong?

                           irene
              nothing yet.  i'll start experiencing
              symptoms in my late-fifties.
                      (matter-of-fact)
              but unless they come up with something between
              now and then, i won't live much past 67.

     jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the
     statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.

                           irene
              of course i think about it every day.

                           jerome
                      (still not quite recovered from his surprise)
              of course.
