     int.  concert hall.  night.

     a standing ovation.  the young pianist on the stage bows deeply,
     soaking up the applause of the audience.  the pianist tosses one
     of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an
     adoring fan.  the second glove he tosses up to the box where
     jerome and irene are standing.  jerome snares the glove out of
     the air and immediately hands it to irene.  she promptly slips
     the glove on her own hand.

     the glove fits snugly over her five fingers.  however one finger
     of the glove remains unfilled.  jerome is stunned to realize
     that it is a six-fingered glove.

                           irene
                      (catching his look of astonishment)
              you didn't know?

                           jerome
                      (trying hard to convince)
              yes...yes...

                           irene
                      (picking up a resentment, confused)
              you're angry--

                           jerome
              why would i be angry?  it was beautiful.

     he quickly turns away to lead the applause.  on stage, the
     pianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd.  both his
     hands contain a perfectly formed extra finger.
