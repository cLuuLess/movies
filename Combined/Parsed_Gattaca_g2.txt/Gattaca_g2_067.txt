     ext.  satellite dish.  night.

     eugene lies on the hood of the car, leaning against the
     windshield, drinking from a bottle of vodka.  in the
     background, the unmanned satellite dish.  jerome relieves
     himself against the building at the base of the satellite.

                           eugene
                      (gently chiding jerome over the joyride)
              you idiot.  you could ruin everything
              with a stunt like that.

     eugene spies a spacecraft launching from gattaca city.

                           eugene
                      (gazing up into the night sky)
              at least up there your piss will be worth something.
                      (smiling at the thought)
              you'll all be showering in it, right?

                           jerome
                      (zipping his fly)
              and drinking it.  it's like evian by the
              time it's filtered.

                           eugene
                      (referring to the rocket ship)
              what is that one?

     jerome doesn't bother to look in the direction of the craft but
     merely glances to his watch.  he joins eugene on the hood of the
     car.

                           jerome
                      (looking at his watch)
              11.15 to the port.  a maintenance crew.

                           eugene
              how long do you stay up there before you go?

                           jerome
              a day or so.

                           eugene
                      (beaming)
              i still can't believe they're sending you to
              the belt--you of all people--never meant to be
              born, on a mission to discover the origin
              of life.

     eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to jerome.

                           jerome
              you should be going instead of me.

     jerome taps eugene's lifeless legs with his foot.

                           jerome
              up there they wouldn't be a problem.

                           eugene
                      (glancing heavenwards, shaking his head)
              you know i'm scared of heights.
