     int.  jerome's condominium.  day.

     jerome, white as a ghost, climbs the stairs, emerging into his
     own condominium.  he embraces the beaming eugene, still sitting
     on the sofa.

                           jerome
                      (numb)
              how are you, jerome?

                           eugene
              not bad, jerome.

                           jerome
              how the hell did you get here.

                           eugene
                      (deadpan)
              i could always walk.  i've been faking it.

     jerome almost laughs, despite the situation.  only now does he
     notice irene on the other side of the room, her mind racing.
     she looks at jerome and eugene together and runs from the
     apartment.

                           jerome
                      (calling after her)
              irene.

     jerome goes to follow but eugene stops him.
