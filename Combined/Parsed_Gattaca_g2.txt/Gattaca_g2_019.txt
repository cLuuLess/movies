     int.  genetic counselling office.  day.

     a geneticist stares into a high-powered microscope as antonio,
     maria and 2-year-old vincent are shown into the office by a
     nurse.  on the counter beside the geneticist is a glass-doored
     industrial refrigerator containing petri dishes arranged on
     racks several feet high.

                           geneticist
                      (to the nurse, without taking
                       his eyes from his binocular microscope)
              put up the dish.

     while antonio and maria take a seat in front of a television
     monitor, the nurse puts a labelled petri dish under a video-
     equipped microscope.  the geneticist swings around in his chair
     to greet his clients.

     four magnified clusters of cells - eight cells on each cluster
     - appear on the television screen.

                           geneticist
              your extracted eggs...
                      (noting the couple's names from
                      data along the edge of the screen)
              ...maria, have been fertilized with...
              antonio's sperm and we have performed an
              analysis of the resulting pre-embryos.
              after screening we're left with two healthy
              boys and two healthy girls.  naturally, no
              critical pre-dispositions to any of the major
              inheritable diseases.  all that remains is
              to select the most compatible candidate.

     maria and antonio exchange a nervous smile.

                           geneticist
              first, we may as well decide on gender.
              have you given it any thought?

                           maria
                      (referring to the toddler
                      on her knee)
              we would like vincent to have a brother...
              you know, to play with.

     the geneticist nods.  he scans the data around the edge of the
     screen.

                           geneticist
              you've already specified blue eyes, dark
              hair and fair skin.  i have taken the liberty
              of eradicating any potentially prejudicial
              conditions - premature baldness, myopia,
              alcoholism and addictive susceptibility,
              propensity for violence and obesity--

                           maria
                      (interrupting, anxious)
              --we didn't want--diseases, yes.

                           antonio
                      (more diplomatic)
              we were wondering if we should leave some
              things to chance.

                           geneticist
                      (reassuring)
              you want to give your child the best possible
              start.  believe me, we have enough imperfection
              built-in already.  your child doesn't need
              any additional burdens.  and keep in mind,
              this child is still you, simply the best of you.
              you could conceive naturally a thousand times
              and never get such a result.

                           antonio
                      (squeezing maria's hand)
              he's right, maria.  that's right.

     maria is only half-convinced, but the geneticist swiftly moves
     on.

                           geneticist
              is there any reason you'd want a left-handed
              child?

                           antonio
                      (blank)
              er, no...

                           geneticist
                      (explaining)
              some believe it is associated with creativity,
              although there's no evidence.  also for
              sports like baseball it can be an advantage.

                           antonio
                      (shrugs)
              i like football.

                           geneticist
                      (injecting a note of levity)
              i have to warn you, mr luca, he's going
              to be at least a head taller than you.
              prepare for a crick in the neck in
              sixteen years time.

     antonio beams proudly.

                           geneticist
                      (scanning the data on the screen)
              anything i've forgotten?

                           maria
                      (hesitant about broaching the subject)
              we want him--we were hoping he would get
              married and have children.  we'd like
              grandchildren.

                           geneticist
                      (conspiratorial smile)
              i understand.  that's already been taken
              care of.
                      (an afterthought)
              now you appreciate i can only work with
              the raw material i have at my disposal but
              for a little extra...i could also attempt to
              insert sequences associated with enhanced
              mathematical or musical ability.

                           maria
                      (suddenly enthused)
              antonio, the choir...

                           geneticist
                      (interjecting, covering himself)
              i have to caution you it's not fool-proof.
              with multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.

                           antonio
              how much extra?

                           geneticist
              it would be five thousand more.

     antonio's face falls.

                           antonio
              i'm sorry, there's no way we can.

                           geneticist
              don't worry.  you'll probably do just
              as well singing to him in the womb.
                      (rising to end the appointment)
              we can implant the most successful
              pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.

     maria is staring at the four magnified clumps on the screen.

                           maria
              what will happen to the others?

                           geneticist
                      (reassuring)
              they are not babies, maria, merely
              "human possibilities".

     removing the petri dish from beneath the lens of the microscope,
     he points out the four minuscule specks.

                           geneticist
              smaller than a grain of sand.

     dissolve to
