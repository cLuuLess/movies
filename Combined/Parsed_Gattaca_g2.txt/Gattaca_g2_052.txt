     int.  gattaca.  present day.

     we return to jerome's reflection in the glass.  other gattaca
     employees are gradually gathering behind him.

                           jerome (vo)
              in the guise of jerome morror i have risen
              quickly through the ranks of gattaca.  only one
              of the mission directors has ever come close
              to discovering my true identity.

     we now see what jerome has been gazing at through the window
     the whole time - the sight that has brought a hush to the
     complex.  through an open office door lies the body of a large
     man - the murdered director, lying where he has just been
     discovered, in a pool of his own blood.

                           jerome (vo)
              strange to think, he may have more success
              exposing me in death than he did in life.

     jerome wipes his eye and also goes to investigate.  we focus on
     an extreme close up of his eyelash.  loosened by jerome's hand,
     it breaks free and floats gently down to the floor where it
     comes to rest.
