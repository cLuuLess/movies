     ext. gattaca - glass wall.  day.

     vincent cleans a window from the outside, staring in at the
     arrogant gattaca employees entering the security channels -
     a smaple taken from their fingertips.  jerome, in a trance,
     constantly cleans the same spot of glass.  he fails to notice an
     older janitor, caesar, appear beside him.

                           caesar
              when you clean the glass, vincent, don't
              clean it too well.

                           vincent
                      (confused)
              what do you mean?

                           caesar
                      (glancing to the gattaca workers)
              you might get ideas.

                           vincent
              but if the glass is clean, it'll be easier
              for you to see me when i'm on the other
              side of it.

     caesar smiles at vincent's cockiness.
