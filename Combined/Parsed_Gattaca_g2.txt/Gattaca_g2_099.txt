     int.  craft.  day.

     jerome familiarizes himself with the interior of a spacecraft
     under the supervision of director josef and the mission
     commander.  the screen that jerome sits at is identical to the
     one he operates in the computer complex - displaying asteroid
     951 gaspra.

                           director josef
              --somewhere in the dust of gaspra is the key.
                      (warming to his theme)
              back to the beginning of the book--the life we
              became.  with the original building blocks who
              knows how far we can take "the godding".

                           mission commander
                      (wry smile)
              even someone as advanced as jerome will be
              last year's model by the time we're done.

                           jerome
                      (smiling back)
              i wouldn't get your hopes up, commander.

     irene enters the craft.

                           irene
              excuse me, mr morrow.  the investigators have
              begun their testing.

                           detective josef
              this is so inconvenient, irene.  they can
              make an exception for jerome.

                           irene
              i'm afraid not.

                           director josef
              i apologize, jerome.

                           jerome
              it's not yor fault, director.
                      (afterthought)
              if your predecessor were still around
              we may not be going to gaspra at all.
              that's what i would call inconvenient.

     jerome exits the craft with irene.
