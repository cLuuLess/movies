     int.  personnel office - waiting room.  day.

     17-year-old vincent hides his glasses in his pocket as he enters
     a waiting room.  he gazes around at other applicants.

                           jerome (vo)
              my father was right.  it didn't matter how
              much i lied on my resum√à, my real c.v. was
              in my cells.  why should anybody invest all
              that money to train me, when there are a
              thousand other applicants with a far cleaner
              profile?  of course, it's illegal to discriminate -
              "genoism" it's called - but no one takes the
              laws seriously.

     as jerome enters the office, we focus on the doorhandle he has
     just touched.

                           jerome (vo)
              if you refuse to disclose, they can always
              take a sample from a doorhandle...

     vincent hesitates before shaking the personnel officer's
     outstretched hand.

                           jerome (vo)
              ...or a handshake...

     we focus on jerome's envelope attached to his application form
     sitting on the manager's desk.

                           jerome (vo)
              ...even the saliva off your application form.

     sitting opposite the manager, jerome's face falls.  the manager
     puts a clear, plastic cup in front of jerome.

                           jerome (vo)
              but for the most part we know who we are.
              and if all else fails, a legal drug test
              can just as easily become an illegal peek
              at your future in the company.

     vincent saves the manager the trouble and exits the office,
     leaving the cup where it sits.
