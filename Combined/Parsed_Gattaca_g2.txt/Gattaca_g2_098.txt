     int.  gattaca.  day.

     jerome, drinking water, stands in front of a large video
     bulletin board.  among other things, it displays the electronic
     mugshot of 20-year-old vincent alongside the recent computer
     generated age enhancement of his face.

     some distance away, caesar, the elderly janitor, discusses the
     mugshots with a younger janitor.

                           caesar
              look like anybody to you?

                           younger janitor
              not to me.

                           caesar
              ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?

     jerome half-smiles, realizing that the conversation is for his
     benefit.  having made it clear that they do not intend to expose
     their former colleague, the two janitors continue their rounds.

     jerome crushes his paper cup.  forgetting himself, he
     drops the cup into the wastebasket.
