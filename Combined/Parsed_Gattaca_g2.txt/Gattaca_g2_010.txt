     int.  gattaca - toilet stall.  day.

     jerome immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and
     detaches a secreted stainless steel container.

     with surprising swiftness and dexterity, jerome removes an
     extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair
     into the toilet bowl.  he inserts two replacement lenses from
     the container and reattaches it in its hiding place.
     jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall.  he checks in the
     mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted.
