     int.  gattaca.  day.

     jerome sits in a formal briefing room with the other crew
     members of his mission, receiving their final pre-flight
     instructions.  lamar looks on approvingly.

                           mission commander
              --finally, i'd like to welcome navigator morrow
              on his debut mission--if we get lost out there,
              nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like
              jerome.

     jerome looks up bashfully.

                           mission commander
                      (adopting a more serious tone)
              i'm gratified that there is no longer a cloud
              hanging over tomorrow's launch.  now we can put
              this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate
              on the task at hand.  i don't have to tell you how
              important this mission is--the belt could hold
              the key to the origin of life - why we are what
              we are.
                      (injecting a note of levity)
              i know many of you have been asking that
              question about me for long enough.
                      (referring to a projected photograph
                      of a misshapen asteroid behind his head)
              gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so
              many beautiful secrets?

     polite smiles from his colleagues.

                           mission commander
              enjoy your final evening with your families.
              we'll all be a year older when they see
              us next.  and don't be late tomorrow.  you
              don't want to miss this.

     we focus on jerome.  he appears to have his head in the heavens
     already.
