     jerome wears his assured smile all the way along the corridor
     and into the now empty locker room.  he exchanges a cheery
     greeting with an exiting colleague, enters a shower stall,
     closes the door behind him and promptly collapses on the shower
     stall floor.

     the effects of the gruelling work-out are only now apparent.  no
     longer sucking up the pain, he gulps air into his oxygen-starved
     lungs, his heart looking for a way through his tightened chest.
     he writhes in agony on the white-tiled floor - a brutal reminder
     of the physical frailty he seeks to disguise.
