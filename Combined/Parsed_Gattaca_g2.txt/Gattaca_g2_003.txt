     he emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large,
     loft-stlye condominium.  through the floor to ceiling window
     that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting

     in the bedroom jerome removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag.
     printed on the bag - "confidentiality guaranteed".  he emerges
     from his bedroom, dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut
     suit.  he adjusts his tie in the mirror, careful not to disturb
     the sachets attached to his fingertips.
