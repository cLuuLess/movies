     int.  investigator's pool.  morning.

     a lone man swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to
     be a pool of enormous length - yet he never reaches the pool's
     end.  we pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against
     an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself.

     abruptly, the man stops and stands up - the fast-flowing current
     instantly stilled.  we glimpse the face of investigator lucas.
     thirties, he has a youthful yet rigid face.  we have the
     impression that he does not swim for pleasure.
