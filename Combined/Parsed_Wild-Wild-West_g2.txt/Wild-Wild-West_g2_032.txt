34   int. white house - day                                           34

     west limps past black floor scrubbers. they stop working
     to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom
     cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place.

     but not everybody's so impressed. as west heads toward
     the oval office, four self-important house detectives
     block his way.

                                house detective
                  whoa there, 'pardner.'
                         (as west stops)
                  winning the war may have got you
                  forty acres and a mule, but you
                  can't just traipse into the
                  president's office. now gimme
                  that gun.
                                                        (continued)

                                                               18.

34   continued:                                                      34

     he nods at the six gun on west's hip. west coolly flexes
     his hand above it, like he's about to draw...

                                 west
                  this gun?

     then like lightning, with his other hand, he whips out a
     sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket. he pokes the
     12-gauge barrels up against pinkerton's surprised crotch.

                                 west
                  or this one?

     a voice stops the situation from escalating further.

                                 president grant (o.s.)
                  gentlemen!

     the detective's head swivels around to see...


     angle - oval office door - president grant

     stands in the doorway.

                                president grant
                  don't make captain west any later
                  for his appointment than he
                  already is!

     the detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as
     fast as they can. west reholsters the gun and
     continues...
