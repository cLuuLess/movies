      west and gordon, bruised but alive, climb off the wasp
      and onto the lower deck. they pick up the president
      and dust him off.

                                 gordon
                   sorry about that, sir. nose up,
                   flaps down. have to remember that
                   next time.

                                 president grant
                   son, never apologize for saving a
                   president's life.

      as gordon realizes that he's finally made amends for that
      night long ago in ford's theater...

                                 amazonia (o.s.)
                   soon you all can fly again. this
                   time with little angel wings.

      west, gordon and grant turn to see amazonia and
      lippenreider with the drop on them.
