76   ext. malheureux point - marsh - night                          76

     general mcgrath, washed up on the shore. west looks down
     at him. now rita, still looking green around the gills,
     rejoins the party.

                                west
                  that's when i vowed to follow
                  mcgrath to the end of the earth.

     as grey as four-day-old mullet, mcgrath manages a smile
     for his relentless pursuer.

                                mcgrath
                         (barely audible)
                  what's the matter, west? thought
                  you'd be happy to find me... like
                  this.

                                west
                  i was hoping to kill you myself.

                                rita
                  that's a nice way to talk to
                  people.

                                mcgrath
                  you'll have to live with it... as
                  i've lived with the blame for new
                  liberty.

     mcgrath fades out.    west grabs him and shakes him.

                                west
                  what do you mean?

                                mcgrath
                         (opens eyes)
                  it was loveless... his plan. he
                  operated the killing machine
                  there. smarter now... left it to
                  others here.

     with the meaning of it all sinking in, west grabs mcgrath
     by the collar and pulls him toward him.

                                 west
                  where is he?   where did he go?!

                                                      (continued)

     the wild wild west - rev. 6/15/98                         58.

76   continued:                                                      76

     the general tries to speak. west puts his ear to the
     general's mouth. but before he can say it, mcgrath
     closes his eyes for the last time.

     west's shoulders sag.    then from behind...

                                rita (o.s.)
                  well, i know that.

     west turns to her... well?

                                rita
                  i'll tell you if you take me
                  along.

                                west
                         (in no mood)
                  just tell me.

                                rita
                  the girls at the mansion. they
                  talk.
                         (imitating a la
                          lippenreider)
                  'i vonder if my hair vill get
                  frissy in ze desert...? vhere is
                  diss ooo-tah anyvay?'

     as west and gordon turn to one another in alarm...

                                west/gordon
                  ooo-tah?!
