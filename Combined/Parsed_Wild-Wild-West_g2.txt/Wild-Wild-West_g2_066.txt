67   ext. loveless mansion - courtyard - night (same time)         67

     west is lifted onto the back of a wagon. with the noose
     dangling in front of his nose, west addresses the crowd.

                                west
                  can i have everyone's attention
                  please. i think we've had a
                  series of major misunderstandings
                  and i'd like to take a moment to
                  clear them up. first, the whole
                  drumming on the boobies thing.
                  in my native land, africa, my
                  ancestors used drums to
                  communicate between villages. i'm
                  sure y'all can see that this young
                  girl here can communicate all the
                  way down to baton rouge. hell, on
                  a clear day, we might even get
                  galveston. all i was saying was,
                  'how're you doing,' 'my name's jim,'
                  'how's your mama?'
                                (more)

                                                     (continued)

     wild wild west - rev. 4/9/99                               47a.

                                west (cont'd)
                  second misunderstanding. that
                  redneck comment. i'm getting the
                  sense that some of you took that
                  negatively. you know, some of my
                  best friends are whiskey-guzzling,
                  pot-bellied rednecks just like
                  y'all here.
                         (then)
                  that slavery thing, i don't see
                  what the big deal was. hell, who
                  wouldn't want somebody to run
                  around for them doing chores. are
                  you going to get your big, fat,
                  lazy ass out of bed every morning
                  and pick your own damn cotton.
                  i don't think so.
                         (then)
                  let's head on inside and knock back
                  some shine. come on, back inside.
                  no. okay.
                         (to soiled dove)
                  i stand before you as a man who
                  realizes he has done something
                  wrong and i am prepared to do the
                  right thing. will you marry me?

     soiled dove gasps.

                                west
                  i'll take that as a no. darling,
                  would it help at all if i said i
                  thought you were a man?

     the camera finds the soiled dove.    she faints.


     back to scene

                                west
                  guess not.

     as west searches desperately for signs of rescue by his
     "partner," suddenly the wagon lurches forward...

                                george washington
                  hang him!

                                                        (continued)

                                                             48.

     new angle - west's feet

     as they plummet toward the ground.


     close - west's neck

     the rope catches... and stretches!


     close - west's feet

     as they slowly touch the ground.

     nobody is more confused than west.


     angle on crowd

     how the fuck did that happen? but before anybody can
     figure out gordon's trick rope, speak of the devil...

                               gordon (o.s.)
                  hey-yaa!!!

     the crowd turns with alarm to see...


     angle on team of charging horses

     nostrils flared and wild-eyed, are having their rumps
     snapped by gordon's reins. rita holds on for dear life
     as the mad mountain man drives the carriage at full speed
     right into the crowd -- scattering them.


     angle on west

     he sees his opportunity for rescue, puts a foot into the
     back of george washington, grabs his gun, and somersaults
     into the air...


     angle on gordon and carriage - west

     lands squarely in the back. and just as the rope starts
     to stretch around his neck again, gordon whirls around
     with a bowie knife and cuts it.
