     gordon has his wardrobe open. selected from his vast
     array of costumes and disguises is a full livery outfit.

                                gordon
                  how about this? you could come
                  as my man servant.

                                west
                         (slave voice)
                  oh yes, massa gordon, dats what
                  i'll do. and i'll jus' smile
                  and do as i's tole so those
                  people won' ever know that i
                  would rather shoot myself in
                  the head than play your god
                  damned man servant!

     west is right in gordon's face.

                                gordon
                  i have a horse costume.
                         (then, cheery)
                  you could be the head.

                                west
                  the only thing i need to wear is
                  this.

     west straps on his holster.

                                gordon
                  okay, if you insist on carrying a
                  firearm, i have something i think
                  you'll find intriguing...

     gordon displays a belt with a silver buckle. he taps the
     buckle... a derringer pops out. west stares, impressed.

                                gordon
                  and it would go nicely with this...

     gordon takes out a sequined dress, holds the derringer up
     against it.

                                west
                  jim west does not wear a dress.

                                gordon
                  then what's your plan?

                                west
                  how 'bout this: i'll go as a
                  government agent who's gonna
                  kill mcgrath.

                                gordon
                  an armed, negro cowboy costume,
                  how creative. in a room full of
                  white southerners, you oughtta
                  fit right in. you might even win
                  first prize!

     west starts to walk away.    gordon grabs him.

                                 gordon
                  listen to me. the art of disguise
                  is what's going to get us into
                  that party, thus allowing us to
                  find these kidnapped scientists
                  before they're forced to create
                  something that will destroy this
                  great country.

                                gordon (cont'd)
                  now you and i are the chosen ones,
                  jim. we're under direct orders
                  from the president himself. and
                  our mission is clear: save our
                  country. our freedom is at stake
                  and this is our duty as men. now,
                  you go as a riverboat captain and
                  i'll be a saloon girl.

                                west
                  let me tell you a little something
                  about beloved 'art of disguise'...
                  that night at fat-can's, i knew you
                  weren't a woman.

                                gordon
                  but i was propositioned by three
                  men.

                                west
                  gordon, you looked nasty. your
                  breasts were all hard and stiff,
                  and were sticking straight out
                  like two rusty cannons on a
                  sunken ship.

     gordon grabs his fake breasts off the rack.       he puts
     them on.

                                gordon
                  these are a work of art.
                  scientifically and aesthetically
                  perfect.

                                west
                  they look like shit.

                                gordon
                  touch them.

                                west
                  i don't wanna touch 'em.   i can
                  see i don't like 'em.

                                gordon
                  what, are you afraid you're
                  wrong? touch my breasts.

     west touches gordon's fake breasts.

     angle - coleman

     walking through the next car, carrying a tray of tea.
     gordon's last line got his attention. what the...?
     coleman peeks around the corner to see west eyeing
     gordon's "chest."

                                coleman
                         (to himself)
                  i knew it. well, i'll have no
                  part of it!

     coleman shakes his head and walks off.


     angle - west and gordon

     west is thwapping gordon's breasts.

                                west
                  there, gordon, you happy?
                  i'm touching your breasts.

                                  gordon
                  not so rough.    the buckwheat'll
                  come out.

                                 west
                  buckwheat?   that's your problem.

     west takes one of the cow udders out of gordon's bodice
     and dumps the buckwheat onto the ground.

                                gordon
                  what are you doing?

     west goes over to a wash basin, picks up a water pitcher
     and fills the cow bladder. west squeezes the cow bladder
     shut and holds it up to his chest.

                                west
                  now, squeeze this. this is what a
                  breast should feel like.


     angle - coleman

     passing back through the next car. when he hears that
     last line, he can't believe it. he peeks in again to
     see...

                                  gordon
                  whoa...

                                west
                  isn't that nice?

                                 gordon
                  very nice.

     coleman's mouth drops.     he's sweating.

                                west
                  now touch yourself.

                                 gordon
                  you win.   i'm hard.

                                coleman
                         (disgusted)
                  federal officers, bah!

     coleman walks off, shaking his head.


     back to scene

     suddenly, gordon shoots the cuffs off his jacket. out of
     one sleeve comes a pen. out the other, a small pad of
     paper. they are both connected to a spring-loaded metal
     gizmo up his sleeve. west reacts, drawing his pistol up
     into gordon's face.

                                gordon
                  i was just going to jot down a
                  thought.

                                west
                  you know something, that's a good
                  place to put a gun.

                                gordon
                  but then, where would i keep my
                  notepad.

                                west
                  you know, artemus, i think you
                  underestimate the convenience of a
                  pocket.
