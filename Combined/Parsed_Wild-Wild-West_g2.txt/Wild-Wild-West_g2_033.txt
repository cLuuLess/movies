35   int. white house - oval office                                  35

     president grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar.
     backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up
     to the myth.

                                president grant
                  been a lot of death threats lately
                  ... cabinet made me hire some damn
                  detectives.
                         (by way of apology)
                  drink, cigar?

                                west
                  thank you, sir.

     west limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a
     glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               19.

35   continued:                                                      35

                                president grant
                  i hear you let general mcgrath
                  get away?

     now west's blood is up.

                                west
                  sir, i had him right in my hands
                  when some half-a-sissy wearin' a
                  dress ruined...

                                president grant
                         (cuts him off)
                  artemus gordon.

                                west
                  you... know him?

                                 president grant
                  of course i know him, he's the
                  best marshal i've got! he's a
                  genius.
                          (off west's
                           incredulous look)
                  gordon has proven himself time and
                  again as a very cunning operator
                  with a rapacious intellect.
                  nothing will stop him from
                  completing a mission for his
                  president... except the impulsive
                  actions of a headstrong cowboy!

     west just looks at him soberly. draws his gun and
     places it against the president's head. grant's eyes
     widen.

                                  west
                  who are you?

                                president grant
                  i am the president of the united
                  states!

     west points the gun to the ceiling and pulls the trigger.
     blam!!! as grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down...

                                  west
                  wrong answer.    who are you?

                                president grant
                  i am the president of...
                         (as west cocks gun)
                  ... i'm artemus gordon.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               20.

35   continued:    (2)                                               35

     west lowers his gun, nods at gordon's class ring.

                                west
                  the president went to west point
                  ... not harvard.

                                president grant (o.s.)
                  will somebody tell me what the
                  hell this stunt is all about!?!
