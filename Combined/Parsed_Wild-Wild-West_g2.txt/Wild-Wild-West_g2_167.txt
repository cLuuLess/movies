      loveless turns to grant, his face beaten and bruised.

                              loveless
                mr. president, i'll ask you once
                again. sign the surrender or i
                decimate this town!

                              president grant
                you've had my answer.

      loveless's face darkens as amazonia hands him a tray of
      cotton balls.

                              loveless
                       (as he puts in earplugs)
                i find the sound of people
                screaming while they get blown to
                smithereens, ruins the ear for
                music. don't you?

      he offers them to the president.    grant swats them away.

                              loveless
                commence firing!

      and with that the tarantula opens fire on the town.
      there's a lot of stomping and smashing, too.
