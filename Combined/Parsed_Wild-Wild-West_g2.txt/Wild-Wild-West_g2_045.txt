     coleman's a scowling, grizzled old man in a coal-stained
     suit. he's got a fire in his eye, brown spittle in the
     corner of his mouth where a cigarette butt lives
     permanently, and a large copper pot in his hand.

                             coleman
               knock each other about all ya
               please, but harm my train and
               i'll douse ya like dogs.

     he threatens them with the pot of steaming liquid.   now,
     for the first time, gordon really looks troubled.

                  well then, let's get on about our
