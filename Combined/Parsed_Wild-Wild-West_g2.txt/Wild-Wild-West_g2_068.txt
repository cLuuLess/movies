69   ext. offshore - loveless boat - night                           69

     dr. loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are
     sipping champagne. one of them is holding a little dog
     in his arms, barking at something in the dark. general
     mcgrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically
     pensive. loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of
     champagne.

                                loveless
                  well, general, it's been a long
                  journey from new liberty.

     mcgrath visibly winces at the sound of it.

                                mcgrath
                  sir, there isn't a day that passes
                  that i don't contemplate it.

                                loveless
                  yes, and so do i. so do i.
                         (reflexively reaches
                          for missing legs)
                  if i'd only had the scientific
                  understanding of gunpowder and
                  primers that i have today...

                                                       (continued)

                                                           51.

69   continued:                                                  69

                                mcgrath
                  that's not what i meant.

     loveless looks at him, puzzled, then gets it.

                                loveless
                  oh, you mean the stomach-churning
                  carnage that earned you your
                  unfortunate nom de guerre...

     loveless speaks for the benefit of the others.

                                loveless
                  what was that nickname again?

                                mcgrath
                         (reluctantly)
                  'bloodbath' mcgrath... the butcher
                  of new liberty.'
