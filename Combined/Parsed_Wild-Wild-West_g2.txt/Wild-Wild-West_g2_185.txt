206   int. tarantula - below deck - dusk                              206

      west's eyes are popping out of his head, the mechanical
      pressure of loveless's leg.

                                 gordon (o.s.)
                   stop or i'll shoot!

      if possible, west's eyes pop even further.     gordon shoot?


      new angle - loveless

      looks up to see gordon holding the derringer on him from
      up above.

                                 loveless
                   you expect to kill me with that
                   little pea shooter?

                                   gordon
                   if i have to.    yes.

                                 loveless
                   why is it, that i'm unafraid?
                          (chuckles)
                   i believe you gentlemen are the
                   polar opposites of a moral
                   dilemma and i'm stuck in the
                   middle. on one end, we have
                   mr. west, a man of primitive
                   vigours uncomplicated by
                   intellect. and on the other,
                   there's mr. gordon. a man of
                   ideas, but unlike myself, lacks
                   the passion to kill for them.
                   he'd like to be able to act his
                   way out of it. and for some
                   reason when he's actin', someone
                   always seems to get killed.

      loveless puts more pressure on west's head, he groans.
      gordon aims.

                                  west
                          (gasps)
                   shoot him, gordon...!

                                 loveless
                   i'm right about you, aren't i,
                   gordon? and that's why i'm
                   gonna kill your friend here.
                   then i'm going to kill you.

      pop! the shot startles loveless, west and even gordon.
      but when loveless realizes that he's not hit, he laughs.

                                 loveless
                   after all that, you missed.

                                  gordon
                   not exactly.

      he gestures down loveless's legs to a punctured metal
      tube that's spraying a stream of hydraulic fluid all over
      the deck -- rendering the foot on west's head, powerless.
      west gets out from under, rubs his neck to regain
      circulation.

                                 west
                   better than a fountain pen, don't
                   you think.
                          (nods behind gordon)
                   by the way, your chivalry's about
                   to be tested.

      gordon turns to see...

      angle - amazonia and lippenreider

      charging him. they smash into him, driving him to the
      rail. as they pummel him, trying to throw him over,
      gordon realizes this is no time for passivity. he
      retaliates with a series of chops and kicks that would
      make west proud. over the rail, goes lippenreider. in
      that split-second before she drops, gordon mouths
      "bye-bye."

      before he can savor the moment further, amazonia clubs
      him from behind. gordon whirls and hits her so hard it
      surprises them both. over the railing she goes! as
      amazonia hovers there, president grant gives her the
      kick in the pants she needs to go sailing.

                                 president grant
                          (to gordon, impressed)
                   we'll be joining them in a moment
                   if you can't stop that thing!
