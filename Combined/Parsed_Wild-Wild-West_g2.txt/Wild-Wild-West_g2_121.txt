132   ext. river canyon near cornfield - day                            132

      west is on the other side of the precipice.       they're
      separated by about 15 feet of air.

      they both see the discs closing in.       think fast.

                                 west
                   when i give the signal.   jump off
                   the cliff into my arms.

                   are you crazy?! do you see what's
                   down there?

                                 west
                          (watching the discs
                           approach)
                   five, four, three, two...

      west holds out his arms.

                                                         (continued)

                   forget it.   i'm not doing it...

                                  west
                   one...

      west takes a leap of faith... and finally, so does
      gordon.

                                  gordon
                   oh shit!


      close - partners

      meeting mid-air. they drop out of frame, just as... the
      two discs collide with a mighty explosion that is heard
      by...
