176   int. loveless's lair - amphitheater - loveless - dusk           176

      sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage.
      loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it.

                                 loveless
                   my partner nations insist that we
                   make this as legal as possible.
                   personally, i like the symmetry of
                   it. after all wasn't it you who
                   made us sign a surrender at
                   appomattox?

      loveless snaps his fingers. amazonia drags grant out of
      his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands.

                                 president grant
                   never will i sign that paper,
                   never will the united states ever
                   surrender!

                                                        (continued)

                                                               96.

176   continued:                                                     176

                                 loveless
                   well, sir, we're at loggerheads
                   then, aren't we? and i suppose
                   the threat of death to someone
                   with your valorous war record,
                   would mean nothing.

      grant sets his jaw intractably.     he's right about that.

                                 loveless
                   ... so, if you still refuse to
                   sign this surrender... we'll start
                   by shooting your man, gordon.

      loveless whirls, nods to amazonia who drags the president
      back to his seat, pulls gordon out of his. rita can't
      help her outburst.

                                 rita
                   artemus!

      artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the
      circumstances. he whispers to rita and the president.

                                 gordon
                          (tugs at his vest)
                   don't worry, i'm wearing the
                   impermeable.

      rita turns to grant. what the hell is that? gordon has
      no time to explain as amazonia hauls him up on the stage.
      as munitia aims her rifle... gordon holds up a finger.

                                 gordon
                   if i may have one request... it's
                   that she aim at my heart... which
                   has loved this great country so
                   much!

                                 loveless
                          (considers for a moment)
                   shoot him in the head.

                                 gordon
                   great.

      munitia cocks her rifle, then just as loveless holds his
      hands up for the signal to fire... the lights dim...

                                                                 97.
