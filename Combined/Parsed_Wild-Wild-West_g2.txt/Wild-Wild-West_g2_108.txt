119   ext. wanderer - back platform - day                            119

      loveless is sitting in his wheelchair, fifty yards from
      west and gordon. on loveless's elbow sits miss
      lippenreider. she looks through binoculars and lip reads
      west and gordon.

                                 loveless
                   continue, miss lippenreider...

                                 miss lippenreider
                          (doing both voices
                           in a monotone)
                   west. let go of my leg! gordon.
                   listen to me. loveless collared
                   us with the same metal device we
                   found on morton.

      loveless turns to munitia, who is loading two 36-inch-
      diameter metal discs into what looks like a cd
      changer/clay-pigeon-thrower.

                                 loveless
                   oh, munitia... i hope we're not
                   going to leave evidence behind
                   like we did last time.

                                 munitia
                   nitro this time, sire.

      as she arms the device, and a red light comes on...

                                 loveless
                          (through megaphone)
                   good morning, gentlemen! i trust
                   you slept well.
