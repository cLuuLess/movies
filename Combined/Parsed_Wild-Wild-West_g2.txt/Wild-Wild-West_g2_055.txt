56   int. loveless mansion - downstairs - party - rest of           56
     loveless' women - night

     miss east leads them in a sober rendition of "the battle
     hymn of the republic" in front of a large doorway.

                                distaff corps
                         (singing)
                  'mine eyes have seen the glory
                   of the coming of the lord...'

                                                      (continued)

                                                               37.

56   continued:                                                      56

     from behind the doors we hear the whir of an elevator.
     it stops with a clunk. suddenly...


     new angle - doorway

     bursts open and abraham lincoln in a mini-float appears.
     it's decked out like lincoln's box at ford's theater. on
     its own power, it moves past the laughing party-goers in
     the foyer. now the women throw grapes on the floor.

                                distaff corps
                         (singing)
                  'he has trampled down the vintage
                   where the grapes of wrath are
                   stored!'


     west's pov - angle on wheels of wheelchair

     are what's trampling down the vintage. west takes in the
     whole man. very curious. then suddenly... kaboom!


     angle on abe's head

     it explodes like a pinata. up from the hole in his neck
     peeps... dr. arliss loveless.

                                loveless
                         (impishly)
                  don't you just hate that song?

     the southern crowd gasps at loveless's dramatic appearance.

                                loveless
                  why, y'all look like you've seen a
                  ghost! it's me, dear friends,
                  alive and kicking! well, alive,
                  anyway...

     as he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove
     the lincoln paraphernalia. then step aside, revealing...


     new angle - dr. loveless

     is half a man. literally. cut off at the waist and
     mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an
     engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and
     everything else in that vicinity that makes life
     interesting.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               38.

56   continued:    (2)                                               56

                                loveless
                         (chuckles)
                  we may've lost the war, but heaven
                  knows... we haven't lost our sense
                  of humor!

     dr. loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his
     fritz lang metropolis-style suit. his face turns dark as
     he surveys the crowd.

                                loveless
                  not even when we've lost a lung...
                  a spleen... a bladder... two
                  legs... thirty-five feet of small
                  intestine and our ability to
                  reproduce...
                         (like a preacher)
                  all in the name of the south...
                         (then quietly)
                  ... do we lose our sense of humor.

     you can hear a pin drop.    loveless turns to the foreign
     dignitaries.

                                loveless
                  i owe a deep debt of gratitude to
                  my friends across the sea for
                  their comfort and... succor.

     he suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that
     surround him. then abruptly, manically...

                                loveless
                  so...! mi casa es su casa! ma
                  maison est a vous! let the party
                  begin!!!

     loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing. miss
     east leans down and whispers in his ear. loveless looks
     in west's direction.

     now loveless wheels over to west. west isn't hiding.
     he's cocky in the face of rolling danger.

                                loveless
                  mr. west, how nice of you to join
                  us tonight... and add color to
                  these monochromatic proceedings.

     west keeps a lid on his temper.    two can play at this
     game.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               39.

56   continued:    (3)                                               56

                                west
                  well, when a man comes back from
                  the dead, it's an occasion to
                  stand and be counted.

     loveless smiles slightly.

                                loveless
                  miss east informs me that you were
                  expecting to meet general mcgrath
                  here. i knew him years ago... but
                  haven't seen him in a coon's age.

                                west
                  i bet a man like yourself would
                  find it difficult to keep in touch
                  with even half the people you
                  know.

     danger flickers in loveless's eyes.    he looks to miss
     east.

                                loveless
                  perhaps the lovely miss east will
                  keep you from being a slave to
                  your disappointment.

                                west
                  well, you know beautiful women...
                  they encourage you one second, cut
                  the legs out from under you the
                  next.

     loveless's face drops. he is no longer amused. miss
     east winks at west, then accompanies loveless in the
     direction of the study where...
