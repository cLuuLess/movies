      the crowd who'd taken refuge behind it runs away in
      panic. all but one of them. a second president grant

      shouts up at loveless.

                                 gordon/grant
                   in matters of war, the person to
                   talk to would be me.

      if there's anyone more surprised than the president
      himself it's...
