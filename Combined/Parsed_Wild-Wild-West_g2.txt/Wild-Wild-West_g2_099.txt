109   ext. tracks - train chase - day                               109

      west slides under the train! he lies flat as the death
      machine roars over him. at the last second, he lassos
      the rope around the rear axle. it slows him for a
      beat... then stretches. he's gotten gordon's trick rope.
      we see his silent scream -- "artemus!" he slides way
      behind the tank/train, then springs back... past the
      tank/train. finally, west slides back underneath and
      manages to grab hold of their caboose. he swings his
      legs up, pulls himself around onto the step.

      the wild wild west - rev. 6/15/98                       70.
