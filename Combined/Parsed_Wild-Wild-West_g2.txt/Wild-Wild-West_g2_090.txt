       west and gordon are about to head forward when gordon
       glances out the back, grabs west.

                                 gordon
                   jim, we're the ones chasing
                   loveless, correct?
                          (as west shoots
                           him a look)
                   then perhaps you could explain
                   what they're doing behind us.

      as west looks out the back too... ka-boom!! a shell
      explodes just to the right of them. now another
      explosion to the left of them. the wanderer rocks
      precariously from wheel to wheel, throwing a screaming
      rita back and forth between west and gordon.

                                 west
                   they couldn't fire the cannon at
                   us from in front. any other
                   questions?
