214   int. tarantula - below deck - dusk                             214

      the jolt shoots west off the girder. he free-falls
      through the belly and out into the open air. thinking
      quickly, he grabs onto the back of loveless' wheel-
      chair. his arms nearly torn from their sockets. his
      weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it
      hanging on by a thread. west reaches out, grabs the
      wheel of the chair and hangs there.

                              loveless
                well, i'll be a monkey's uncle.
                how did we arrive in this dark
                situation?

                                west
                i don't know.    guess i'm stumped!

                              loveless
                and i'm so cotton-pickin' afraid
                of heights. they just give me the
                spooks!

                              west
                ah, don't be afraid, loveless.
                with this being the last leg of
                our journey and all, you should
                soak in the view, you're really
                missing something.

                              loveless
                mister west, i'm gonna cut this
                conversation short...

                              west
                good one, loveless.   i didn't think
                of that one.

                                 loveless
                          (furious)
                   mister west!!! i am faced with a
                   difficult decision here. on one
                   hand, there is the overwhelming
                   love that i have for myself, and
                   on the other, the raw, seething
                   hatred i have for you! now, i
                   could kill you very easily, just
                   by pulling this lever...

      he moves the joystick.    the chair jerks back.

                                 loveless
                   but, of course, i would die along
                   with you. i guess the only thing
                   that i can take comfort in is the
                   hope that you would hit those
                   rocks a second before me and i
                   could enjoy immeasurable bliss
                   before i vanish.
                          (moving joystick
                           back and forth)
                   what to do, what to do...

      west grabs the joystick.

                                 west
                   allow me to make that decision
                   easy on you, loveless. because
                   i want to see you dead a hell of
                   a lot more than i want to live.

                                 loveless
                   why is it that i have a sneaking
                   suspicion, that although you are
                   as black as the night on the
                   outside... inside, you are yellow?!

      they lock eyes.    a beat.

                                 loveless
                   you don't have it in you, do you...
                   boy?!

                                 west
                   you were right. let's cut this
                   conversation short!

      west yanks the joystick back.

      angle - loveless

      his eyes widen. the wheels spin for a second, finally
      catch, and in a flash, loveless and west free-fall into
      space.

                                 loveless
                   weeeeeeeeeest!!!!

      a beat, then...

      angle - chain

      which is dangling from the belly of the beast. at
      the bottom of the chain is the knife guy from the fight
      scene. west is hanging on to his ankles, enjoying a
      vindictive, belly laugh.

                                 west
                          (downward)
                   now that looked like it hurt.
