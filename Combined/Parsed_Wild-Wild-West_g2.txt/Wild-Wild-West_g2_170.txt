191   ext. sky - desert wasp (in flight) - above silverado -          191
      dusk

      west and gordon swooping down low. west unfastens
      bombs from his vest, waits for the right moment. as
      they swing past the tarantula cannon, he drops them.
      boom! boom! the big gun falls limp.
