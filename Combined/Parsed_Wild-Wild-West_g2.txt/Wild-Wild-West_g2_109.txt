      west and gordon squint through the corn, see loveless on
      their train.

                                 gordon
                   what have you done with rita?

                                                      (continued)

                                                                74.

                                 loveless
                   rita, is it? how familiar! rita
                   is sleeping off the after-effects
                   in the stateroom.
                          (looks toward bedroom)
                   quite lovely, isn't she? who
                   knows... i might even become
                   'familiar' with her myself.

      gordon takes a step.    west stops him.

                                 west
                   and that would become one more
                   reason why i'm going to kill you.

                                 loveless
                   yes, mr. west, i'm sure a well-
                   endowed blackamoor like yourself
                   must find it absolutely
                   impossible... that a freak like me
                   could fully enjoy the pleasure of
                   a woman. but having witnessed my
                   use of mechinology so far...
                   wouldn't you think i could provide
                   myself with something for the
                   lower half of my body that was
                   hard-pumping and indefatigably
                   steely?

      loveless looks o.s.

                                 loveless
                   ... and speaking of 'hard
                   pumping...' mr. coleman, full
                   steam ahead!
