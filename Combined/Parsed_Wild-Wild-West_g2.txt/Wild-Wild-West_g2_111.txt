                   what a marvelous train! you don't
                   mind if i borrow it, do you,
                   gentlemen?

                   other than a lack of wheelchair
                   access, i find it a most
                   comfortable way to pass the long
                   miles from here to my laboratory
                   in spider canyon...
                          (louder, as they
                           move off)
                   i'll be seeing president grant
                   soon at promontory point. what
                   shall i tell him for you? i'm
                   afraid it can't be that you're
                   alive and well...

      and as his maniacal giggle hangs in the air...
