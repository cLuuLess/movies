     west and gordon, oblivious to the impending disaster...

                             west
               so now what...?

                                                    (continued)

                                                                17.

     kaboooooom!!!    theme music up... as we roll...


32   main titles                                                      32

     the titles are the familiar animated freeze frames from
     the tv show. in the two corners are our heroes -- upper
     left shows west with his gun levelled toward... upper
     right -- gordon with his wig in one hand and his badge in
     the other, pointed across toward west.

     the cowboy/agent in the middle square fights and defeats
     the various bad guys. then as he exits, quick zoom on
     main title: "the wild wild west."

     pan down to a sketch of a train caboose as titles end...
