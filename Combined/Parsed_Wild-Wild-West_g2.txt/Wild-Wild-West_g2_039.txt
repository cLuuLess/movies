40   int. wanderer - parlor car - day                                40

     the car is like a classy victorian men's club. bar
     stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative
     pistols on the wall, books, etc. gordon, seated in a
     club chair, looks over as west falls from the ceiling
     into a seat. he's hot, dusty and very pissed off. he
     glowers at gordon murderously.

                                gordon
                         (calmly)
                  thanks for dropping in.

                                 west
                  forget the bikes, the beards, the
                  fake boobies. put down the
                  needlepoint and let's settle
                  this like men!

     he takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves.
     gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing.

                                gordon
                  as a matter of clarification, this
                  isn't needlepoint. this is.

     he shows him some real needlepoint.

                                                       (continued)

                                                               26.

                                gordon
                  right now, i'm putting the final
                  touches on a new invention of my
                  creation. i call it... the
                  impermeable. it's a vest that,
                  when worn under the clothing, can
                  stop any modern bullet fired even
                  at close range.

     west draws his gun, aims it at gordon's stomach and cocks
     the trigger.

                                 west
                  really?

     gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.

                                gordon
                  but it hasn't been really
                  tested empirically yet.

                                 west
                  get up!

     west takes off his guns and puts them on the table.

                                gordon
                         (yawn, yawn)
                  guns. i find them so primitive
                  and unnecessary... if one has done
                  one's proper planning.

                                 west
                  yeah?   how do you feel about a
                  fist?

     gordon puts down the impermeable, stands with a weary
     sigh.

                                gordon
                  i must tell you, mr. west, i've
                  always felt that allowing a
                  situation to degenerate into
                  physical violence is a failure on
                  my part.

                                west
                  well then, 'mr.' gordon, you
                  failed.

     whap! west unleashes a lightning punch that drives
     gordon across the train car. he dabs at his bloody lip.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              27.

                                gordon
                  i'm sorry, mr. west, you brought
                  this on yourself.

     then to west's utter amazement, gordon puts his hands
     together as if praying while at the same time, crooking
     his right leg stork-like. is this some kind of martial
     art? then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet
     dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a
     switch.

     it immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down
     from the ceiling. it whacks west on the side of the
     head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table.


     angle on pool table - west

     shakes it off and is about to attack again. gordon
     calmly pokes a hidden button. suddenly the pool table
     revolves. west is gone.

                                gordon
                  i love this train!
