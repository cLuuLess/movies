6   int. fat-can candy's - night                                  6

    this two-story, victorian building across town is a
    "gentlemen's sporting house" in name only. drunken
    roughnecks and ex-confederate soldiers goose and maul
    the rouged-up tarts.

    at bar - woman

    shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. the toulouse
    lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and
    makeup, identifying her as a soiled dove. a whore -- not
    to put too fine a point on it. she's trying not to make
    eye contact with two men seated at a table across the
    parlor.


    soiled dove's pov - gen. mcgrath and hudson

    hudson is a fearsome-looking indian in a well-tailored
    suit. long black braids descend incongruously from under
    a homburg hat. as for his companion...

    mcgrath is a mountain of drunken pus. six foot, sweating
    like a devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized
    confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.
    his ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to
    be a miniature leather victrola horn. mcgrath smiles at
    our soiled dove and makes a little kissing gesture.

    angle on soiled dove

    eyes widened in revulsion. what evil abides in this
    godforsaken place? now a drunkenly eye-crossed reb
    licks dora's ear, then whispers something in it.
    something unspeakably vile, by dora's expression.

                              dora
                 i'm sorry. that won't be
                 possible. i have... tonsillitis.
