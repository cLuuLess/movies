139   ext. spider canyon rim - day (later)                              139

      west and gordon trudge past the wanderer.     it's parked
      at the end of the line, looks deserted.

                                 gordon
                   jim, i know i've hallucinated
                   it several times before, so is
                   that really the wanderer?

                                 west
                   that's the wanderer.

      gordon seems relieved to know his beloved train is not
      another mirage. they continue on to the rim of the
      canyon, peer over the edge. reacting to what they see...

                                 gordon
                   and would it be too much to
                   hope that i'm simply seeing a
                   world's fair down there... ?
