70   ext. malheureux point - marsh - night                       70

     a reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down
     to marsh. beyond that is the gulf of mexico. we
     recognize one of the rebs from the cathouse. he opens
     his pocket watch.

                                reb #1
                  they oughta be here by now.

                                reb #2
                  maybe we're in the wrong place.

                                reb #1
                         (rechecks map)
                  no, we're supposed to wait 'xactly
                  on this here spot.

     suddenly they hear a clanking and screeching coming from
     the marsh. they ready their arms and get in defensive
     positions. what they can't see through the fog is...


     angle - marsh - armored tank

     amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds,
     passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the
     center of the field. the contraption has a large cannon
     and gatling guns bristling from several ports. the rebs
     cheer their new weapon.

     the wild wild west - rev. 7/1/98                         52.
