63   int. loveless mansion - study - painting - night               63

     the painting behind him has come to life. the loveless
     in the painting swings a real shotgun around and is
     pointing it at the back of west's head.


     close - west

     suddenly contorts his upper torso just as an explosion
     rips the back of the chair where his head would have
     been.

     he draws and shoots the would-be assassin, who falls out
     of the painting, dead. west turns to see...


     angle on miss east

     a surprised look on her face. a hole in her forehead.
     he lowers her head gently to the ground, regards her
     map-imprinted rear end.

                                west
                  thanks for helpin' me get to the
                  bottom of this case.
