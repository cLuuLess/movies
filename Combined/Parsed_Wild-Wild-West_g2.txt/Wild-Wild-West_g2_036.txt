     west and gordon, walking toward the hitching post. west
     is so beside himself he can barely untie his high-voltage
     stud. he glowers at gordon who goes over to where...


     angle - strange-looking bicycle

     is parked on the other side of a bush. it has the
     customary big wheel in the front, little wheel in the
     back. (hidden from sight is a motor on the front tire.
     dual manifolds that sling under the rider's legs.)

     west shakes his head in disgust.

                                west
                  figures.

                  i call it the bi-axle nitro-

                                 west
                  save it.   i've gotta train to
                  catch.

     west swings into the saddle. he looks at the snorting
     wild horse under him, then down at gordon attaching the
     box onto the seat of his nitro-whatever.

                                west
                         (snaps off a smug
                          salute)
                  yee-haaa!!

     west spurs his horse and leaves gordon in the proverbial

     (yep, artemus has invented the first motorcycle!) fiery
     exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels
     him down the street at about 60 mph right past...
