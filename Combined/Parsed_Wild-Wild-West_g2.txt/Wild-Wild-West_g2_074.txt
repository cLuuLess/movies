75   ext. malheureux point - battlefield - night                     75

     west slowly dismounts, transfixed by the slaughter on the
     pre-fab battlefield. there's something hauntingly familiar
     about all this for him -- the mangled bodies, the tread marks...
     but we'll find out about that later.

     west draws his weapon and begins walking through the
     victims. the pace of his search quickens when he isn't
     finding what he's looking for -- general mcgrath.

                                                       (continued)

     new angle - gordon and rita

     have arrived in the one-horse carriage. gordon is trying
     to recreate the crime scene. rita trails behind him, his
     coat thrown over her shoulders, trying not to gag as she
     passes the mangled corpses.

                                gordon
                  it came up out of the lake...
                  from the way these corpses are
                  positioned, laid down a 360-degree
                  pattern of cannon fire... then
                  disappeared in moments.
                         (puts a foot on a body,
                          scratches his chin)
                  my god, what kind of weapon is it?

     rita can't handle gordon's clinical posturing.

                                rita
                  excuse me, i think i'm going to be
                  sick.

     as she walks quickly away, west comes over, a haunted
     look on his face.

                                west
                  it just rolls on and on. makes a
                  screeching sound -- like a wounded
                  animal. got a 'cabin' on top with
                  a cannon... swivels 'round like an
                  eagle's head.

                                gordon
                  you saw it?

                                west
                  heard about it. thought it was
                  crazy survivors' stories.

                                gordon
                  what survivors? there aren't any
                  here.

                                west
                  new liberty, illinois -- the free
                  slave town just over the border.
                  just one week before the war ended
                  in '65. i was in the 9th cavalry
                  that discovered it. old men,
                  women, children... they used them
                  for target practice...

     he looks out at the battlefield as if reliving it.
     gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts
     up. west's grim reverie is interrupted by moaning coming
     from the shoreline. they all follow the sound to find...
