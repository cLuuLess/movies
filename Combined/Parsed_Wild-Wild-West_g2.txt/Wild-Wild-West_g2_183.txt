       loveless begins a metallic-flamenco, hands on his hips,
       his piston-like legs kicking west's body and head.

                                  loveless
                    it feels so good to stretch my
                    legs.

      west can't take much more of this, he's about to pass
      out. loveless lowers his alloy foot over west's head and
      begins to crush it like a grape.

                   i likes to beat my feet on the
                   mississippi mud!
