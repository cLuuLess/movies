172    ext. loveless's lair - amphitheater - dusk                     172

       loveless, wearing a black tunic festooned with medals
       and a prussian-style helmet with a horse hair plume,
       raises his arms nixon-like as a band plays a flourish.

                               loveless
                 bonjour, buenas tardes and good
                 day! great glorious day! a day
                 of healing for the wrongs that
                 have been done to us all!

                                                      (continued)

                                                               93.

      framed by a large flag featuring the spider emblem, he
      looks out from center stage of a greek theater at the
      crowd of foreign dignitaries seated around him.

                                 loveless
                   ... oh, how long have we waited!


      angle - amazonia, munitia and lippenreider

      dressed in tight fascist-brown tankwear, rise from their
      seats and applaud. the only people not applauding are a
      row of haggard, bearded scientists and the manacled
      prisoners gordon (sans disguise), rita, grant and
      coleman.

                                 loveless
                          (looks to
                           englishman)
                   ... 1776, wasn't it, old bean?
                   most expensive cup o' tea in
                   history...!

      as the englishman dignitary nods soberly...
