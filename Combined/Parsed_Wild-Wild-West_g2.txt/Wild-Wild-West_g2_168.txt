189   ext. sky - desert wasp (in flight) - dusk                       189

      high above the tarantula. gordon, lost in the joy of
      flight, turns to west who is more of a white-knuckler.

                              gordon
                i think i'll call it...

                              west
                lemme guess... an elevation enhancer?

                              gordon
                       (why would you
                        call it that?)
                no, air... gordon.

      now west points to the tarantula and chaos below.

                              west
                go down, down there!

                                                      (continued)

                                                               106.

189   continued:                                                      189

                                 gordon
                          (as if to a child)
                   you can't just 'go down there.'
                   flight depends on lift, which must
                   be calibrated to the angle of
                   descent...

                                 west
                   shut up and go down there, will
                   ya?

      west reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward.
      as the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the tarantula
      and gordon strains to keep control...
