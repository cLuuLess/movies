73   ext. train siding (near malheureux point) - night                 73

     a black waits ominously on the tracks. it's less a
     traditional train car than a riveted, armored, turreted fortress
     on wheels. also, it currently lacks an engine.

     loveless, over his shoulder to the foreign contingent...

                                                       (continued)

                  my destination is both the
                  future... and the past! forget
                  paul revere, this will be the most
                  revolutionary ride in the history
                  of america!!

     he looks dotingly at the tank, which clatters up from the
     battlefield on its treads... then drives onto the tracks.
     wheels drop down out of the chassis, the treads retract
     up, and the tank backs into the rest of the train.
     clank. it's a neat modular fit. black death on rails.

     the foreigners watch with awe as...


     angle - loveless

     wheels up onto the tank/train. he drops the
     expansiveness, fixes them with a viper's eye.

                                loveless
                  if you don't want to miss the
                  ride, have the last payment of
                  1000 kilograms of your country's
                  gold in my hands no later than
                  friday. that's when i make our
                  little proposal to president
                  grant. one i'm ever so confident
                  he's gonna accept.
                         (now a jaunty wave
                          of his hat)
                  au revoir, adios, and ta-ta!
