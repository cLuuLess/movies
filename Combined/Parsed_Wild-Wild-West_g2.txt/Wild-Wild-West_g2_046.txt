47   int. wanderer lab car - dusk                                   47

     a severed human head is in a vise.

                                gordon
                  meet professor thaddeus morton,
                  expert in the field of metallurgy
                  ... discovered in a field of
                  alfalfa. kidnapped from m.i.t.
                  six months ago.

     west looks from the head to the open box.

                                west
                  that's a man's head!

     gordon holds up a strange, circular metallic object.

                                 gordon
                  ... and this magnetic collar was
                  around it when his body was
                  discovered. haven't figured that
                  one out yet...

     but west is still staring in disbelief at the head.

                                west
                  that's a man's head.

     gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind
     the head.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               30.

                                gordon
                  according to the retinal terminus
                  theory... a dying person's last
                  conscious image is burned into the
                  back of the eyeball like a
                  photograph.   perhaps there's a
                  clue there...

     excited, gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back
     of his head. beams of light are coming through his
     eyeballs, creating a blurry color image on the wall.

                                gordon
                  morton's last image!

                                west
                  that's a man's head!

     west turns his head sideways to try to view the inverted
     image projected on the wall. gordon realizes the
     problem.

                                gordon
                  ah. the refraction of the lenses
                  causes the image to appear upside
                  down. we simply...

     he turns morton's head in the vise.      it's right side up,
     but still blurry.


     angle on wall - fuzzy image

     appears. it's a man who has a tiny victrola horn for an
     ear. he's holding a bloody metal boomerang.

                                  west
                  it's mcgrath.    i was right all
                  along.

     gordon sees something in mcgrath's pocket.

                                gordon
                  he seems to have something in his
                  pocket... too fuzzy to read,
                  though...

     gordon drums his fingers on his great frontal lobe,
     stymied.

                                gordon
                  mortification of the aqueous humor
                  seems to have led to the loss
                  of...

                  ... glasses.

     west takes the bifocals out of the box, casually puts them
     on morton's nose. west now gestures to the wall.


     close - image on wall

     the white blur in the man's pocket is now focused. we
     can see that it's the top of a piece of paper. he reads
     the writing on it.

                                west
                  'friends of the south! come to
                  a surprise costume ball. april
