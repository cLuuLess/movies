20   ext. country road - wild wagon ride - night                     20

     west's custom boots drag in the dirt as he's about to be
     trampled under the hooves of the freaked-out horses. and
     if he hasn't got enough problems, the lynch pin attaching
     the team to the wagon has almost worked its way out.


     close - back of wagon - nitro vials

                                                       (continued)

                                                              10.

20   continued:                                                     20

     clanking together like chimes...


     close - west

     straining with every ounce of strength in his body, he
     pulls himself up by the harness onto...


     close - wild-eyed lead horse

     west grabs for the halter.

                                 west
                  whoa now...!

     but it doesn't whoa. the wagon goes around a corner up
     on two wheels! it's about to tilt over when west grabs
     both the horses' ears, yanks them back -- screaming into
     them.

                                west
                  i said, whoa!!!

     this approach seems to work.
