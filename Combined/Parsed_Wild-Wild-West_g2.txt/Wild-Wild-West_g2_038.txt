39   ext. c street train station - train engine - day            39

     from in front, as it chugs towards us. sitting up in the
     spanking new steam engine (no. 5) is a white-haired
     coleman. the wanderer is his pride and joy. coleman
     pushes the throttle forward and the engine roars past
     us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger
     cars.

     then comes west thundering past in a desperate effort to
     catch up.

                                                   (continued)

                                                               25.

     angle - with west

     riding like hell. getting the last ounce of speed out of
     his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the
     rear passenger car. he looks up... in the window, we see
     gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to
     be sewing.

                                west
                  stop this train!! you hear me!?!

     if gordon hears him, he pretends not to.    he just
     casually makes the next stitch.

     west's horse has had it. they're losing ground to the
     train. at the last second, west leans over at full
     gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. he
     swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life,
     blowing in the breeze like laundry.

     finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its
     weight on. just as west stands safely on it... whoosh!
     he flies up in the air and drops through a sliding
     partition in the roof.
