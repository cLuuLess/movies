118   ext. cornfield - day                                              118

      a sea of corn tassels waving in the wind. loveless's
      destroyed train is in the b.g. the camera tilts down to
      find...


      angle on west and gordon

      lying on the ground with their backs to us. they stir.
      west props himself up, looks over at gordon, who has just
      regained consciousness.

                                 west
                          (mimicking him)
                   an innocent billiard ball this
                   way, but depress the number and on
                   impact... a sleeping-gas bomb.

      west shakes his head disparagingly and stands. he feels
      the metal band around his neck and surveys the 18-inch
      wire fence which has been laid around them in a circle.
      west is about to step over it. gordon grabs his leg.

                                 gordon
                   don't move!
