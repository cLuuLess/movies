61   int. loveless mansion - party - gordon - same time -           61
     night

     is being the perfect party guest, moving through the
     crowd chit-chatting with this person and that (in
     french, spanish, german) when he sees something of
     interest.

     munitia and lippenreider come out of an upstairs bedroom,
     lock it behind them. hmmm. what's in there? as he
     starts upstairs, amazonia appears, blocking his way.

                                gordon
                  howdy there... big sturdy gal.
                  yer dance card full?

     amazonia stares at him, then spiels off a couple lines
     in a foreign language that makes gordon's eyes widen.
     he understands what she said and it's not flattering.
     gordon moves off in a shock.
