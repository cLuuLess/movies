66   int. loveless mansion - upstairs bedroom - gordon -             66
     night

     eases in, stops at what he sees. and it sure ain't
     scientists. beside the bed, locked in an iron disco-like
     cage, is rita, still wearing her scanty outfit. gordon
     squints at her, gives a charming smile.

                                gordon
                  i feel as if we know each other
                  from someplace...?

                                rita
                  try again, buster...!

     she takes a breath as if she's going to start screaming.
     gordon quickly holds up a hand.

                                gordon
                  ma'am, please! while i realize i
                  look like something straight out
                  of james fenimore cooper... i mean
                  you no harm. my name is artemus
                  gordon. and you look like you're
                  in trouble.

                                      rita
                            (dryly)
                  really?

     to rita's amazement, gordon opens his jacket and
     unbuttons his vest to reveal... a complete miniature tool
     shop. quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it
     to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots.

                                 rita
                  i'm rita. i was hired here as an
                  entertainer. not that i'm
                  complaining, but what are you
                  doin' in here?

                                gordon
                         (looking up miles
                          of leg)
                  looking for some missing
                  scientists... not that i'm
                  complaining.

     gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. it becomes a pedal
     that operates the wheels' rotation. now he removes a bit
     and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. starts
     to pump his foot. it's a foot-powered drill.

                                gordon
                  i'm a special u.s. marshal on
                  assignment from the president.

                                rita
                         (almost impressed)
                  if you're so special, how come
                  you're lookin' up here when
                  loveless has 'em all workin' down
                  in the dungeon?
                         (rattles bars
                          impatiently)
                  get me out of here and i'll take
                  you down there.

                                                       (continued)

                                gordon
                  too late. the 'dungeon' is
                  cleaned out. it was the first
                  place i checked, right after i
                  sampled the gumbo. bit heavy on
                  the okra.

     but rita isn't listening to the food review. her mind's
     racing. finally, the lock clicks and the cage door
     swings open. gordon takes the distressed damsel in his
     arms, lifts her out.

                                 rita
                         (suddenly a coquettish
                          smile)
                  thank you... artemus, was it?

                                gordon
                  one doesn't forget a smile like
                  that. now where in the world was
                  it...? have you ever played the
                  empire room... the bijou cafe
                  perhaps...?
