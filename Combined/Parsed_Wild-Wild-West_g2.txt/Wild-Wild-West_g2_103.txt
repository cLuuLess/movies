      west and hudson roll around precariously. west claws
      desperately at the garrote. it looks grim for our hero

      sinking the blade into hudson's leg. west grabs him and
      shoves him head first into the smokestack. the big
      indian plugs it up like a cork in a bottle.

                                                               71.
