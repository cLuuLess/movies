216   ext. promontory point - close on golden spike - day            216

      it's driven finally into place to a rousing cheer. pull
      back to reveal that president grant, his sleeves rolled
      up, has delivered the blow.

      hats in the air, handshakes, pictures. the specter of
      loveless and his evil plot a fading memory.

      grant turns to west and gordon.

                                 president grant
                   gentlemen, i now strongly believe
                   the united states is going to be
                   truly united. not because of this
                   railroad... but because of you.

                                                       (continued)

      the wild wild west - rev. 7/1/98                          115a.

      grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this
      momentous event. he reaches into his pocket, takes out
      two silver shields.

                                 president grant
                   i've signed into law the creation
                   of an agency whose sole duty is to
                   protect the president and the
                   country from lunatics like
                   loveless.
                          (pins badges on
                           their vests)
                   welcome to the secret service,
                   agents no. 1 and no. 2.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                    116.

216   continued:                                                           216

      the president shakes both their hands.       gordon resists
      looking down.

                                 gordon
                   uh, just out of curiosity, sir...
                   who's agent no. 1?

      grant just shakes his head, some things never change.

                                 president grant
                   i don't think that matters very
                   much, do you? gordon? besides,
                   you'll have plenty of time to
                   discuss it on your new assignment.
                          (hands them piece
                           of paper)
                   see you back in washington.

      he snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it.
      gordon looks up, very troubled.

                                 gordon
                   but, sir... what about our train?

                                 president grant
                          (over shoulder)
                   well, i'm taking it of course.
                   hell, you let loveless blow up
                   mine.

      as they look at one another in dismay...

                                 rita (o.s.)
                   jim... arte...?

      they turn to see rita approaching them from a crowd of
      scientists. she's looking extraordinarily fetching
      in a print dress and parasol.

      west and gordon sit up like dogs.

                                  west
                   rita!   you look great.

                                 gordon
                   ravishing, a vision.

      she hugs west, she hugs gordon.        who's it gonna be?

                                 rita
                   i just wanted to thank you for
                   everything you've done for me...
                   before i went back home to texas.

                                                          (continued)

                                                                117.

216   continued:    (2)                                                216

                                 west
                   texas? why're you going back
                   there? why don't you come with me
                   back to washington?

                                 gordon
                   or better still, come with me to
                   washington. i could introduce you
                   to people i still know in the
                   theater...

                                 west
                   she's not really an entertainer,
                   remember?

                                 rita
                          (intercedes)
                   i can't go with either of you.

      she looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.

                                 rita
                   it's not that you both don't have
                   your attributes.
                          (to gordon)
                   you're so sophisticated and such a
                   wonderful cook.
                          (to west)
                   jim, you're good with a gun... and
                   have great legs.
                          (to both)
                   and you're both so brave. but...
                   i'm afraid i haven't been
                   completely honest with you.

                                 west and gordon
                   uh-oh...

                                 rita
                   professor escobar's not my father.
                   he's my husband.

      she gestures to a handsome goateed latino waiting for
      her. shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we
      thought.

                                 west
                   rita... why didn't you just tell
                   us that in the first place?

                                                        (continued)

                                                                   118.

                                 rita
                   well, i was going to... but would
                   you have really brought me along
                   if i said i was married?
                   honestly.

      neither west nor gordon knows what to say.

                                 rita
                   i didn't think so.

      she turns and starts to walk away.       stops and smiles.

                                 rita
                   at least you still have each
                   other.

      as west and gordon look at one another...
