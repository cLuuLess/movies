185   ext. desert and cliff - nitro-cycle - dusk                     185

      builds ground speed. gordon is nervous at the wheel.
      west gives him an encouraging pat.

                              west
                avant...! avant!!!

      but their speed is not enough to get them airborne.

                              gordon
                we're not getting enough lift!
                we need more speed!

      then in an uncharacteristic move by gordon, he turns the
      machine around and heads for the cliff.

                              west
                hey, uh... that's the cliff over
                there, you know?

      he guns the accelerator.

                              gordon
                yes, i do know.

      and with that, the nitro-cycle goes off the cliff! it
      disappears for the count of five. then suddenly it
      swoops up and past camera. they're flying!
