72   ext. offshore - loveless boat - night                          72

     lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large
     binoculars on a stand.

     general mcgrath turns from the rail and faces loveless,
     outraged.

                             mcgrath
               why you sawed-off sadistic
               bastard! you've betrayed us!

     loveless turns to him, cocks his head.

                             loveless
               my dear general, after donating
               half my physical being creating a
               weapon capable of doing this...
               how did you and general lee repay
               my loyalty? you surrendered at
               appomattox! so, who betrayed whom?

     loveless turns to munitia holding a steno pad.

                             loveless
               munitia, make note. turret speed
               needs to be accelerated!

                             munitia
                      (to amazonia)
               change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8!

     amazonia pushes a sick dignitary away from the rail so
     she can get a sight line to the tank with her lantern
     semaphore. she begins flashing the new gear ratio.

                                                      (continued)

                                                               53.

                                amazonia
                  a bucket for the minister, please!

     now in the b.g., we hear the gatlings open up.
     lippenreider is reading the lips of the tank's victims.

                               lippenreider
                  scream. scream. my head. i'm
                  dying. scream. moan. scream.

                                mcgrath
                  loveless, i demand you give the
                  order to stop this slaughter now!

                                loveless
                         (ignores him)
                  ... we're going to need more
                  loading drills! i'm hearing too
                  much time between screams.

     as munitia scribbles dutifully, mcgrath shoves her aside.
     he pulls his pistol.

                                mcgrath
                  for the last time, give them the
                  order to desist!

     loveless, his back to him, is seemingly unconcerned at
     having a gun barrel pressed against his skull.

                                loveless
                  general, i understand your
                  distress. but believe me, those
                  men are not dying senselessly. it
                  is for a far greater cause than
                  you can imagine.

     as loveless's right index finger finds a black button on
     the arm of his wheelchair...


     close angle - loveless's wheelchair arm

     the steel tubes that comprise the armrests are actually
     shotgun barrels facing fore and aft. mcgrath's finger
     tightens on the trigger.


     wider

                                mcgrath
                  go straight to hell, sir!

                                                       (continued)

                                loveless
                  after you... sir.

     booom!!! mcgrath has a very startled expression as he
     looks down at the aftereffects of double-ought buckshot.
     as he crumples to the deck, loveless sniffs.

                                loveless
                  bloodbath mcgrath indeed.

     the dignitary's dog starts barking, jumps to the deck.
     it sits next to the fallen general's gramophone ear and
     cocks his head. with the rca logo invented we move back
     to...


     angle on loveless

     he sighs at his pale guests. they don't seem to
     appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter.

                                loveless
                  well, that concludes the
                  festivities. ladies, feed him to
                  the crabs.

     munitia and amazonia unceremoniously dump mcgrath's body
     overboard. sploosh... loveless addresses the
     dignitaries...

                                loveless
                  but, my friends, that tank is just
                  a little ol' toy compared to what
                  this country's greatest scientists
                  are cooking up for me next. so if
                  i've piqued your interest, bring
                  1000 kilograms of your country's
                  gold to spider canyon four days
                  from now.
                         (starts to roll
                          off boat)
                  now if you'll excuse me, i've got
                  a tank to catch.
