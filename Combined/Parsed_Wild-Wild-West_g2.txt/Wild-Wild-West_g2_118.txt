129   ext. cornfield - aerial shot - west and gordon - day              129

      running a zigzag pattern toward the end of the cornfield.
      west sees a gully fifty yards ahead of them.

                                 gordon
                   head for that gully!

      west zigs out of the cornfield one way. gordon zags out
      the other. they're both beat-up and exhausted from
      running and flopping on the ground.
