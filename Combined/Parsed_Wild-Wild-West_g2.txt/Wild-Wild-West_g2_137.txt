152   ext. promontory point - long shot - day                       152

      the tarantula in full view. people start screaming
      in terror as it appears over a ridge, huge even at
      this distance. the metal beast closes the 200-yard
      distance in seconds.

      the citizens flee. the detectives are not far behind
      them. the soldiers take cover and ready their weapons.
      grant stands his ground... even as a huge foot clomps
      down in front of him, vibrating the camera.
