55   int. loveless mansion - downstairs - party - night             55

     west surveys the crowd.

                                miss east
                  see anybody that looks familiar?

     west scans the room.    stops.

                                west
                  matter of fact, i do.


     west's pov - woman with big hair

     she's got the mole, too.    gordon has apparently encored
     his soiled dove get-up.

     miss east sees who he's looking at. she makes a pouty
     face as there's a flourish from the stereo quartet.

                                miss east
                  i'm... jealous.
                         (blows a little
                          kiss at him)
                  meet me later... in the foyer.

     west watches as she joins...
