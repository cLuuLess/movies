22   int. fat-can's - close - mcgrath                              22

     mcgrath is clapping with the crowd of misfits who are now
     singing along with gordon/dora. he/she's won over the room.

                             gordon/crowd
                      (rousing finish)
               and tell them i tried just the
               same...!

     he/she curtsies to rousing applause. mcgrath beams like
     a man with the fire in his loins roaring. he grabs his
     little songbird and up the stairs they go.

     out the windows, we see west tracking them.    simul-
     taneously going up outside steps.
