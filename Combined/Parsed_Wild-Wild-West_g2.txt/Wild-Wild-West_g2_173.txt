194   ext. tarantula - bridge - dusk                                  194

      loveless wheels his chair amid the smoke and chaos,
      shocked. warning horns are going off.

                              president grant
                well, i'll be damned... it's west
                and gordon... flying!

      grant chuckles at the dauntless pair's pluck.

                              president grant
                keep that surrender handy. i
                think you're going to need it!

                              loveless
                don't be too sure...

      loveless thinks for a moment, pushes grant out of the
      way, and rolls over to the controls. he pushes a lever
      and the tarantula bends down on its knees. he barks to
      munitia.

                              loveless
                i'm through with diplomacy... take
                him away and kill him!
