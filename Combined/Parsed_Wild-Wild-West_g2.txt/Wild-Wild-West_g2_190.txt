212   int. tarantula - below deck - dusk                             212

      the sudden stopping jerks loveless' wheelchair free.
      despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the
      opposite railing. when the wheelchair hits a pool of
      hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180
      degrees.

      west jumps up, grabs a girder. the wheelchair spins
      under west's legs and then -- clank -- it slams into
      the railing and wedges there.
