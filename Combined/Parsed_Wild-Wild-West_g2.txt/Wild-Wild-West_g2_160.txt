179   int. loveless's lair - amphitheater - behind stage -            179
      dusk

      as fire engulfs the place, loveless has no choice but to
      retreat... for now. surrounded by a cadre of his women,
      who carry the unconscious president grant, loveless heads
      through a round steel vault door. as amazonia swings the
      door closed, the foreign dignitaries bang on the door
      begging for admittance.

                                                     (continued)

179    continued:                                                      179

                                  french minister
                    monsieur, we are your partners!
                    you can't let us die in this
                    fire!!

                                  loveless
                    it's not the first time y'all have
                    been burned in america.

       he chuckles, nods to amazonia, who slams the door closed.
