     mcgrath paces in front of loveless's desk.

                                mcgrath
                  dr. loveless, my men are ready to
                  go to war with no weapons to
                  fight. ever since the nitro and
                  the guns were destroyed at fat-
                  can's, lice and demoralization
                  have set in!

                                loveless
                  your men will have their weapons
                  tonight. and my promise that they
                  will be part of the greatest
                  military victory of this century!

     mcgrath's face relaxes into a pyorrheic grin.

                                mcgrath
                  oh, you're a pip, sir! i'd follow
                  you into the maw of cerberus
                  himself!

     loveless takes pencil in hand and draws a map on the
     desk.

                                                      (continued)

                                                              41.

58   continued:                                                     58

                                loveless
                  and so you shall.
                         (makes an x)
                  have your men here at... 10
                  o'clock tonight.

     loveless wheels his chair toward the door with mcgrath
     behind him folding up the map...
