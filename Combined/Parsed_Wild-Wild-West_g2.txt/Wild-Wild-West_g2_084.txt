     gordon and west react as coleman's voice booms out of
     the pipe.

                                coleman (v.o.)
                         (over pipe)
                  we have loveless, gentlemen!
                  seven hundred yards and closing!

     as they scramble for boots, weapons, rita comes out of her
     room.

                                rita
                  what's going on?

     gordon ushers her to the back.

                                gordon
                  stay back here, take cover!

     meanwhile, west pulls on his boot. when he stands on it,
     a three-inch stiletto snaps out of the toe.

                                west
                  what the hell is this?

                                gordon
                  i took the liberty of installing
                  it while you were sleeping.

     west looks at him incredulously.

                                west
                  leave my stuff alone!

                                                                67.
