30   ext. rise above fat can's - carriage - night (same time)     30

     is waiting at the top of the hill beside the nitro wagon.
     dr. loveless is beside it, face still shadowed.


     inside carriage - fair-skinned beauty

     has opera glasses trained on the second story of fat-
     can's. her name is lippenreider. and now we'll see why.

                             lippenreider
                      (in a monotone)
               get out of my way... get out of my
               way... u.s. army... u.s. marshal.

                             loveless
               oh, dear...

     the lip-reading is interrupted by the arrival of...


     angle - top of incline - hudson and his henchmen

     who come racing up with the scientist-in-the-sack.

                             hudson
               federal agents inside, sir!

                              loveless
               so miss lippenreider informs me.
                      (sighs)
               still, i believe good manners
               dictate we should send out...

     his cane telescopes out and loveless pokes the lynch pin
     out of the harness on the nitro wagon. then he gives the
     wagon the slightest push.

                             loveless
               ... the welcome wagon.

     once started, the wagon rolls downhill, toward the back
     door of fat-can candy's, picking up speed...

     then, as his female coterie pulls the burlap sack into
     the carriage, loveless steps in behind. and they're off.
