26   int. fat-can's - boudoir - gordon/dora                          26

     is busy trying to get the spiral going again, doesn't see
     mcgrath reach for his boot knife. just as the deranged
     general's about to plunge it into gordon/dora...

     ... the window explodes. jim west comes tumbling into
     the room, kicks the knife out of mcgrath's hand in one
     smooth move. west rolls to his feet, fixes a gallant
     smile on gordon/dora.

                                west
                  didn't mean to startle you, ma'am.
                  looked like you could use some
                  help.

     it takes gordon a moment to recover. he stares at this
     black samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is.

                                gordon
                         (clears throat to
                          recover falsetto)
                  looks can be deceivin'... dark
                  stranger. i am perfectly fine.

     west quickly pats mcgrath down, removes a revolver and
     his bag of gold coins.

                                west
                  i can see that, darlin'. woman of
                  your caliber probably gets top
                  dollar, too. so here you go.
                         (flips her mcgrath's
                          coin bag)
                  you can run along. i'll take care
                  of mcgrath.

     as west sticks the barrel of his gun in mcgrath's
     gramophone ear, gordon's eyes pop.

                                                       (continued)

                                                             14.

                                 gordon/dora
                  no!   i need him!

                                west
                  c'mon, lady. you got the money.
                  have a little dignity.

     gordon jerks west's gun hand away from mcgrath's head
     just as the dog-soldier comes around. mcgrath suddenly
     lunges at him.

                                mcgrath
                         (bellows ferociously)
                  west...!!!

     he drives his full weight into jim's back, pushing him out
     into...
