53   int. loveless mansion - upstairs room - night                 53

     west lets himself in. then just as he's about to part
     the heavy drapes... he hears women's voices approaching.

                             woman (o.s.)
                      (in a spanish
                       accent)
               hey... get your hands off me!

     now miss lippenreider, amazonia and munitia (bewigged and
     wearing costumes) wrangle a beautiful and defiant latina
     into the room. when she turns we recognize she's the
     singer from fat-can's. rita is in her early 20s, wearing
     a 19th-century camisole so scanty, it makes it hard to
     concentrate on what she's saying.

                             rita
               put me in the dungeon with all
               those smelly, dirty bearded men
               ... but i am not goin' in there.

                             amazonia
               you applied for the position.

                             rita
               yeah, a standing up position.   i'm
               an entertainer, not a...

     amazonia grabs her by the throat, choking the word off.

                             miss lippenreider
               do not be selfish and stupid. he
               always spoils his new girl.

                             rita
               yeah. well gimme a simple diamond
               bracelet instead of that...


     pov - through door - into bedroom

     a ramp leads to a large bed. a leather and steel
     prosthesis is hanging from pulleys attached to the
     ceiling.

                             munitia
               it is not so bad... once the metal
               warms up.

                                                     (continued)

                                                               35.

53   continued:                                                      53

     amazonia just picks her up and drags the hapless rita
     into the room. west emerges from behind the curtains,
     shakes his head. weird. he eases out the door and
     into...
