57   int. loveless mansion - outside study - night                   57

     general mcgrath waits impatiently. he takes two
     champagnes off a passing tray, guzzles them, then
     wipes his mouth on dolly madison's bustle. as his
     eyes sweep the room...


     angle - west

     he ducks behind a mountain man carrying the french
     tricolor. when loveless and general mcgrath disappear
     into the study and close the door, west eases after
     them. he pauses as he passes the "soiled dove," leans
     into her big bouffant. he regards a stained-glass window
     patterned with a spider over her shoulder.

                                                       (continued)

                                                              40.

57   continued:                                                     57

                                west
                  hey, honey... i see a big ole
                  spider up on the wall. hope it
                  doesn't drop down your pretty
                  dress.

     as the soiled dove jumps a little, west continues over to
     the study door. now the soiled dove turns, and we see
     the scared/confused expression. maybe it's because she
     is not artemus.


     angle - gordon - across room

     he's the mountain man in the fringe jacket. and right
     now he's shaking his head as he watches west resort to a
     decidedly low-tech surveillance method of loveless's
     study.

                                gordon
                  peeking through the keyhole...?
                  so 18th century.
