18   ext. country road - wild wagon ride - night                     18

     west spots the contents of an open box.    eyes widen.


     close - box - dozen glass vials

     stuck in sand. but clinking together ominously as the
     wagon races over the cobblestones.

                                west
                  backwards-ass bumpkins got a wagon
                  full of nitro...!

     west tries to steady the glass vials with his hands...
     but it's no use. he quickly climbs over the boxes, onto
     the buckboard seat. but the reins are dragging on the
     ground beneath the frothing horses.

     west leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the
     street. he pulls himself over the first one's neck...
     onto the next horse. and as he tries for the lead horse,
     he falls between them!
