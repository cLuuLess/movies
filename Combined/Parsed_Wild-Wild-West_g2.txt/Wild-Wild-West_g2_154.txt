173   ext. promontory point - dusk                                   173

      west's body hasn't moved. the only change is that now
      a line of ants crawls across his face. we watch, hoping
      for a twitch, something... but there is none. the ants
      march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on
      his head. if we're not convinced he's dead...


      angle - vulture

      circles lower, finally landing right by west's head.   as
      the hideous carrion-eater leans over west's face...


      extreme closeup - west's eyes

      a shadow falls across them. but instead of the pecking
      red beak, a human hand appears in the frame. brushes the
      ants away. we hear an indian incantation over. then
      finally... west's eyelids flutter open.


      west's pov - navajo shaman

      standing over him. blurry, back-lit by the sun, the face
      of west's indian friend. the healer who can turn himself
      into a bird.

      as west sits up groggily, feels his head. hey, it's
      okay. as he makes a mental note to always be kind to
      animals...
