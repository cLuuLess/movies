128    ext. cornfield - west and gordon - day                        128

       come running toward us. behind and above are two discs
       about to make a dive at them.

                                                       (continued)

                                                                  78.

128   continued:                                                        128

      the discs, like giant razors, are mowing off the tops of
      the corn stalks, heading straight for their heads!

      west and gordon dive to the ground... the discs just
      missing them. west stands to run again. we see the back
      of his head's been buzzed.
