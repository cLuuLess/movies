37   int. white house - war room - continuous action - day            37

     the place is a buzzing intelligence operations center --
     state-of-the-art for the 1860's. maps of the u.s. and
     the world are on the wall. various staff and military
     people work clacking telegraphs, printing machines that
     grind out reports, etc.

     grant stops at a display of daguerreotype photos, all
     depicting distinguished bewhiskered men.

                                president grant
                  ten of our country's best
                  scientists... all kidnapped in the
                  last year. by general mcgrath, it
                  now seems.
                         (turns to them)
                  the fact is, gentlemen, you've
                  both been working on the same
                  case all along. why did it take
                  you so long to realize it?

                                west
                  well, sir, one of us was still
                  trying to figure out if he was a
                  man or a woman.

     the detectives snicker over that one.    grant's had
     enough.

                                president grant
                  i don't have time for this
                  bickering! one week, if we're to
                  believe this...

     grant holds out a letter to gordon and west.      gordon
     snatches it, reads:

                                president grant
                         (reading)
                  'general grant, the scientists
                  that you seek are in my employ --

                  -- creating a weapons system
                  beyond the pale of contemporary
                  imagination. history and justice
                  are on my side. i suggest you put
                  your affairs in order. you have
                  one week before you will surrender
                  the u.s. government.'

                                                     (continued)

                                president grant
                  this letter was delivered inside
                  this.

     an aide presents a glass case.     inside is a cake in the
     shape of the white house.

                                gordon
                         (reaching inside)
                  marzipan, isn't it?

                                 president grant
                          (grabs his hand)
                  wait!

     suddenly dozens of deadly-looking spiders swarm out from
     inside the cake. gordon jerks his hand back.

                                west
                  it's mcgrath, sir. the south is
                  rising again. i'm gonna stop it.

                                gordon
                  sir, west's obsession aside,
                  mcgrath may be a vicious killer,
                  but a mastermind he is not. so
                  whom do we seek? after consulting
                  with intelligence...

                                west
                         (cuts him off)
                  mcgrath's headed for new orleans.
                  the longer we stand here talkin',
                  the farther away he gets. i don't
                  need 'intelligence' to tell me
                  that.

                                 gordon
                  ah, so that would mean you rely on
                  ... stupidity?

     grant's had enough.

                                president grant
                  gentlemen! i'm leaving today for
                  utah where the transcontinental
                  railroads will be joined at
                  promontory point.

     grant points to a map of the united states. the railroad
     lines have been drawn in... still a gap between them.

                                                       (continued)

                                 president grant
                  for the first time the united
                  states will truly be united.
                         (turns, holds up
                          letter)
                  someone wants us divided. now
                  look, you two are the best i've
                  got. put aside your differences
                  and stop this madman... whoever he
                  is. if you fail, well... we may
                  never know how great this country
                  could've been.
                         (snaps off a salute)
                  you have a week. dismissed!

     they both return grant's salute as the president stomps
     off. his aide now approaches.

                                aide
                  the president has put a private
                  train at your disposal. engine
                  number five, track six.
                         (holds out a
                          wrapped box)
                  mr. gordon, the item you
                  requested.

     gordon takes the box, hurries to catch up with west.
