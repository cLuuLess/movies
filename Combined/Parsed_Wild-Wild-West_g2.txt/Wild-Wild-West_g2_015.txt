15   int. warehouse - night                                         15

     west is trying to get dressed.

                                                      (continued)

                                                              7.

15   continued:                                                    15

     as he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at
     him with a knife. west hops up on one leg, smacks the
     guy with a mule kick.

     now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. when the
     hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist --
     which coldcocks the other guard.

                                west
                  could i have a little privacy
                  here?

     as if in response, the water tower, still hovering above,
     now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents.

                                west
                  thank you.

     he calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked,
     screaming saloon girl in his arms.

                                west
                  you'll have to excuse me,
                  darlin'... but my evidence is
                  getting away.

     west gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the
     overhead block and tackle system and slides through the
     warehouse. as the horse team, which has spooked,
     thunders past...


     closeup - west

     sails onto the runaway wagon. as he pulls himself into
     the back, he gives the shivering saloon girl a tip of his
     hat -- now on his head.

                                west
                  sorry about there not being any
                  towels.
