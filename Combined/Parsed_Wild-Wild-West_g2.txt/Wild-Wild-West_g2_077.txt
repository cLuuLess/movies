     west and gordon burst in, surprising coleman, who's got
     his feet up, perusing the playboy of the day -- a mail
     order catalogue.

                                west
                  coleman... let's go!    full speed
                  ahead!

     west snatches the catalogue out of his hands, does a take
     at the pictures of chunky models in bloomers.

                                coleman
                  aye, sir!

                                                       (continued)

                                                              59.

     as coleman quickly exits, gordon looks out the window,
     onto the platform.

                                gordon
                         (wistful)
                  i don't see why we couldn't have
                  given her a ride back home to
                  texas. it is on the way...

                                west
                  on the way to utah where our
                  president happens to be. maybe we
                  oughta be worryin' about that
                  little coincidence!

     as the engine roars to life...
