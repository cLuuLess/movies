      west, gordon, and grant are now under loveless's control.

                                loveless
                  gentlemen, i am truly impressed by
                  your effort and ingenuity. why
                  not swear an oath of loyalty to
                  me... and forego your executions.

                                west
                  why not? well, i guess maybe i'd
                  rather see what happens when i
                  stuff your ass into that cannon
                  up there and fertilize the
                  landscape.

                                gordon
                  uh, jim, i think a polite 'no'
                  would suffice...

      loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens
      up beneath west. he goes crashing down a story.

      loveless sics amazonia on gordon and grant and proceeds
      down the ramp to the level below.

                                loveless
                  lippenreider, take over the
                  controls.
                         (looks down at west)
                  we may not have a woodshed on
                  board, but that boy is gonna get a
                  whoopin' anyway!
