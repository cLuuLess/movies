16   int. fat-can's - night (same time)                            16

     general mcgrath   leers down a line-up of fat-can's girls.
     just as he gets   to the beautiful singer, who looks sick
     at the thought,   suddenly gordon intrudes. he/she blocks
     out the singer,   poses coquettishly -- sucking a
     lollypop.

                                mcgrath
                  what's your name, missy?

                                                     (continued)

                                                                 8.

16   continued:                                                       16

                                gordon/dora
                         (demurely; back to
                          his falsetto)
                  dora. would you like to go
                  upstairs?

                                mcgrath
                  oh, indeedy i would.

     gordon/dora starts to go as the eye-crossed reb wakes up.
     he grabs him/her, very pissed.

                                 eye-crossed reb
                  hey, c'mere!   who the hell are you
                  anyway?!

                                   mcgrath
                  she's... mine!

     blam! mcgrath emphasizes his claim by gut-shooting the
     reb. the shot makes dora/gordon jump and the room go
     quiet. as the reb crumples, mcgrath turns back to
     gordon/dora, oddly inspired.

                                mcgrath
                  i feel like... a ditty!

                                gordon/dora
                  a ditty? but general...
                         (trying to be
                          coquettish again)
                  ... my talents really lay
                  elsewhere.

                                mcgrath
                  nothing stokes the fire in my
                  loins like a ditty.

     mcgrath hauls him/her over to the piano player.

                                mcgrath
                  you've got some pretty fair lungs
                  on ya, girl, now use 'em!

     he punctuates with a slap to gordon/dora's rump.      the
     other singer (rita) watches too.
