14   int. fat-can's - mcgrath and hudson - night                   14

                             hudson
               you'll meet him when the time --
               and place -- are appropriate.
               now...
                      (stands)
               ... shall we go upstairs to check
               the 'merchandise'?

                                                    (continued)

                                                              6.

                                 mcgrath
                  frankly, mr. hudson, i wasn't
                  planning to walk those oaken
                  stairs with you. direct me to the
                  poot, sir. something young and
                  creamy. a gamer that takes to the
                  crop and spur.

     mcgrath looks to the singer (rita), who beats a hasty
     retreat from him after her song. so, once again, mcgrath
     lays his rheumy eyes on...


     angle on soiled dove

     she's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-rebs on the
     balcony with the trunk. as she starts for the stairs...
     a man's hand grabs her. it's the eye-crossed reb again.

                                eye-crossed reb
                  you drive a hard bargain, lady.
                  all right, fifty cents to take
                  them big juicy lips and...

                                dora
                  still not interested.

     she tries to pull away.    but the reb won't let go.

                                eye-crossed reb
                  but you gotta be interested.
                  you're a whore.

     suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage.
     the falsetto becomes a baritone growl.

                                dora
                         (baritone)
                  that doesn't mean a girl can't
                  have high standards.

     just as the reb registers the odd new voice... wham!    her
     corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.    the
     reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground.

     whooa, hoss... the soiled dove is a man! he's artemus
     gordon and his true profession will be revealed to us
     shortly. but now, as he/she stashes the unconscious reb
     behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig...
