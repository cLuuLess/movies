116   int. wanderer - parlor car - day                               116

      gordon and rita are thrown across the car, along with
      everything else inside, as loveless's train's sudden
      stop... jerks them with it. the screech of steel wheels
      scraping on iron rails is sickening. they clutch onto
      one another... as the wanderer skids to a stop.

      as they pick themselves up, gordon looks to rita who's
      shaken up and scared. now footsteps coming up the
      stairs.

                              rita
                i won't let loveless take me
                again! i'd rather be dead!

                               gordon
                       (recalling west's
                        words)
                that's not a good one to wish for.

      to defend herself, rita grabs one of the sleeping-gas
      pool balls rolling around on the ground. gordon leads
      her into the stateroom to lock her in, but she grabs his
      hand.

                              rita
                please, artemus, don't leave me
                alone!

      rita closes the door behind him and locks it.
