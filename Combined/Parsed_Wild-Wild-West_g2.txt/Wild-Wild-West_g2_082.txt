85   int. wanderer - parlor car - night                             85

     rita hasn't even waited for anyone's approval to start
     eating. west shakes his head at her chutzpa.

                                rita
                  but... i can help you.

                                west
                  how could you possibly help us?

                                rita
                  well, i heard you talking about
                  why all those foreign guys were
                  at loveless's party...? you
                  want me to tell you?

                                  gordon
                  by all means.

     she uses the time to get another bite into her mouth.

                                rita
                         (to gordon, chewing)
                  this is fantastic. you can cut it
                  with a fork! how'd you cook it?

                                                      (continued)

                          him)
                  well, in a daubiere... a clay pot.
                  a french method which...

     west cuts off the chit-chat.

                                west
                  what about the foreign guys?!

                                rita
                  they were mad about something,
                  you know? something about a
                  real bad deal in louisiana on
                  purpose.

                                gordon
                  the louisiana purchase?

                                rita
                  and queen somebody-somebody of
                  france got swindled.

                                gordon
                  queen isabella of spain.

     west rolls his eyes.

                                west
                  gordon, this is crazy. she
                  doesn't know what she's talking
                  about!

     west picks up the speaker horn and calls coleman.

                                west
                         (into speaker horn)
                  coleman, stop the train! miss
                  escobar's getting off.

                                coleman (v.o.)
                         (over pipe)
                  who the hell's miss escobar?

                                rita
                         (grabs horn)
                  i'm a frightened, starving, half-
                  naked young woman who only wants
                  to find her father!

                                coleman (v.o.)
                         (over pipe)

                                west
                         (grabs it back)
                  coleman... stop the train.

                                coleman (v.o.)
                         (over pipe)
                  we're not puttin' anybody off.
                  not out here in the middle of
                  nowhere.

     west looks out the window. nothing but sagebrush and
     animal skulls out there. rita comes up close to jim,
     fire in her big, brown eyes.

                                rita
                  please, jim. my father's the only
                  family i've got. what am i
                  supposed to do? sit home and wait
                  for news he's been killed? or go
                  do something! what would you do,
                  jim?!

     that gets the man of action where he lives.

                                west
                  look, i got nothing against you,
                  rita. it's just that... what's
                  going to happen when we catch up
                  to loveless... with you on the
                  train?

     she grabs west's hand.

                                rita
                  i know you'd never let him take me
                  back. i've seen you shoot.

     west kinda melts a little. this girl does have her
     charms. gordon, a little jealous, puffs his chest out.

                                gordon
                  i assure you, rita, an attack by
                  loveless would be an exercise in
                  futility.
                         (stands for tour)
                  ... allow me to demonstrate how my
                  design suggestions have made the
                  wanderer impervious to attack.

     west draws his guns, twirls them and reholsters.

                                west
                  i'm the impervious part.

                                                       (continued)

                               gordon
                  hardly. completely armor-
                  plated...

     artemus raps his knuckles on the wall making a metallic
     sound. then he smugly demonstrates that the light
     fixture is actually a gatling gun.

                                gordon
                  an attacker would find the
                  lighting inside extremely...
                  unflattering.

     finally he moves to the billiard table, while rita nods
     ... and keeps eating.

                                gordon
                  and if, by some inconceivable
                  fluke, they did manage to gain
                  entrance...
                         (rolls billiard ball
                          into bumper)
                  an innocent billiard ball this
                  way.
                         (picks it up,
                          presses the number)
                  but depress the number... a
                  sleeping gas bomb. effective in
                  under three seconds.

     gordon unclicks it, triumphantly rolls it into a pocket.

                                gordon
                  so rest assured, rita... you are
                  completely safe within these
                  walls.

     west snorts at his obvious play for rita's attentions.

                                 west
                  i don't know about you, ma'am, but
                  i know i'll be sleeping a whole
                  lot better tonight...
                         (yawns)
                  ... assuming loveless barges in
                  here and feels like a game of
                  pool.

                                rita
                  speaking of sleeping, i'm pretty
                  tired. artemus, do you think i
                  could borrow something to wear?

     west jumps in before gordon can answer.

                                                       (continued)

                  i've got somethin' you might use.
                  it ain't stylish, but it's
                  practical...
