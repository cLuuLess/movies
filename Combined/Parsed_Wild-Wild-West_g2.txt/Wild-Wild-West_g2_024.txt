24   int. boudoir - continuous action                              24

     our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling
     herself for the task at hand. mcgrath beckons her over
     to the bed.

                             mcgrath
               don't let the ear scare you.    i
               lost it at chickamauga.

     gordon/dora squints at the jerry-rigged ear.

                                                     (continued)

                                                                  12.

                                 gordon/dora
                  oh really. one can hardly
                  notice...
                         (fiddles with her
                           belt buckle)
                  would you mind...? i... i...
                  can't seem to release the clasp of
                  my belt.

     say no more. mcgrath is on her like a flash, fidgeting
     with it. but it pops open, revealing a spiraling screen
     courtesy of dr. mesmer. his eyes lock onto it.

                                mcgrath
                  wha... what's this?

                                gordon/dora
                  it's a deep, deep pool. maybe
                  your old swimmin' hole. getting
                  sleepy, general?

                                 mcgrath
                         (ga-ga)
                  yes, i'm sleepy.

     mcgrath sits on the floor.        gordon smiles... this is
     gonna be easy.

                                gordon
                         (normal voice)
                  good. you're going to be my
                  little doggy. and when i say
                  'speak,' you tell me everything i
                  want to know. understood?

                                    mcgrath
                          (barks)
                  woof!

                                gordon
                  all right, little doggy. sit up.
                         (as he does)
                  now tell me who's in the sack next
                  door. is it the scientist, dr.
                  escobar? speak!

                                    mcgrath
                  woof!   woof!

                                gordon
                  speak words, dumb doggy! tell me
                  the name of the man you kidnapped
                  him for...

                                                         (continued)

                                                               13.

     but mcgrath doesn't answer. gordon's mesmer spiral slows
     to a stop. mcgrath is coming out of the trance. mcgrath
     starts to growl, rip at his/her petticoats.

                                 gordon
                  watch the swirling spiral!   lie
                  down, bad dog!

     as gordon notices that his contraption's failed...
