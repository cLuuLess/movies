123   ext. cornfield - perimeter - gordon and west - day             123

      frustrated, as the train pulls away from them.    west tugs
      at the metal collar around his neck.

                                 west
                   gordon, get out your little tool
                   kit and get this damn thing off of
                   me!

      gordon unbuttons his shirt to reveal his leather tool
      kit... empty except for a note. gordon opens it and
      reads.

                                 gordon
                   'gentlemen, welcome to the
                   loveless experimental camp for
                   political dissidents. there are
                   no guards. no barbed wire. as
                   long as you stay within the
                   designated perimeter, you will
                   stay alive.'
