       is awakening from the effects of the billiard ball gas
       and tries to control her sense of dread and loathing.
       she smiles nervously at loveless, who's being fawned-over
       by his women.

                 rita, my dear, not that i'm
                 ungrateful to providence for
                 bringing you back to me...

       rita jumps as the champagne cork pops.

                               loveless
                 ... i'm just a wee bit curious as
                 to how you managed to wind up with
                 them.

                        (scrambling)
                 well, they uh... seemed so... sure
                 that they could find you... and i
                 thought if i stayed with them...
                 they'd lead me back to... all my
                 friends...

                 and not to give you a big head
                 but...
                        (wrinkles her nose
                         to loveless)
                 i kinda missed you.

                               loveless
                        (not buying it)
                 isn't that a coincidence?    i miss
                 me, too.
