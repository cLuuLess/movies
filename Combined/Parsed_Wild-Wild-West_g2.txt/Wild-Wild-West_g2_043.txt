44   int. wanderer - parlor car - day                               44

     gordon has just settled into the club chair, puts his wine
     down on the table.

                             gordon
               and while you're down there,
               you may want to avail yourself
               of my sub-carriage inter-rail
               egressor...

     suddenly shackles snap out of the arms of the chair,
     pinning gordon's wrists. before he knows what hit him,
     the floor opens and the club chair disappears.
