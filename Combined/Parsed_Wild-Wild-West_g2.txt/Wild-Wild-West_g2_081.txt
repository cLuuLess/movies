82   int. wanderer - parlor car - night                             82

     west has every weapon on the train out for cleaning and
     loading. gordon is in the galley where he continues
     his conversation with west while preparing dinner.

                                                      (continued)

     the wild wild west - rev. 6/15/98                        60.

                                gordon (o.s.)
                         (from gallery)
                  you know, i've been trying to
                  place myself in loveless's
                  shoes...

                                west
                  good luck on that one.

                                gordon
                         (weakly)
                  ha, ha, ha... you know, i can't
                  imagine what loveless -- a man
                  without any reproductive organs
                  could possibly want with rita.

     suddenly there's a whoosh and rita falls through the
     ceiling and plops in the chair just like west did
     earlier. he instinctively pulls his gun. puts it
     away as gordon muses about her anatomy.

                                 gordon (o.s.)
                         (not realizing she's
                          there)
                  not that rita doesn't have a
                  figure that would inspire a
                  botticelli... or a raphael.

     rita raises an eyebrow, looks to the galley as gordon
     comes out with a platter of food. he still doesn't
     see her there.

                                gordon
                  ... especially her breasts. did
                  you notice the way one of them...
                         (cups his hands)
                  both of them actually... to say
                  nothing of her buttocks...

     gordon turns and looks into the car. finally sees her.
     changes gears without missing a beat.

                                gordon
                  ... and the group of foreign
                  ministers at loveless's party...
                  what were they doing there?

     gordon gestures for west to join him at the pool table.
     rita immediately goes for the food.

                                                      (continued)

                                gordon
                         (using pool balls)
                  here's france, spain and
                  britain...
                         (sotto voce)
                  how long has she been here?

                                west
                  since the first breast.

     gordon turns to her, exasperated with himself.

                                gordon
                  i am so embarrassed.

                                west
                  i'll spare you.
                         (to rita)
                  make yourself a sandwich to take
                  with you. you're getting off.
