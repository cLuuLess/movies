      west jumps up on the pool table.

                                 west
                   would it put you out too much to
                   throw me a rope and hit your
                   little secret button?

      same hidden button he had during their fight. whoosh!
      west is gone as the pool table flips over. as rita
      covers her mouth in amazement...

                                 gordon
