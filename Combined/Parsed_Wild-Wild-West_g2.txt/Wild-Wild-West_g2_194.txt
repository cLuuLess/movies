217   ext. monument valley - sunset                                       217

      we gaze out over one of those achingly beautiful john
      ford vistas as we hear our heroes voices.

                                 west (o.s.)
                   you know, arte...

                                 gordon (o.s.)
                   what's that, jim?

                                 west (o.s.)
                   maybe rita's right...

      suddenly intruding into the f.g. is a huge metal leg.
      then another leg clomps down... and the tarantula comes
      into full view. as our heroes ride slowly into the
      sunset.

                                 west
                   besides... there's a lot of
                   other women in the world.

                                 gordon
                   that's easy for you to say. she
                   didn't walk off with your best
                   dress.
