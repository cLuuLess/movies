54   int. loveless mansion - upstairs hallway - night                54

     west hears the party din coming from down below.     he
     goes to the balcony.


     west's pov - over stair landing - downstairs

     the scene below is hallucinogenically surreal. a babel
     of foreign languages is the first thing that strikes us.
     avant garde music is coming from two 10x10 quartet boxes
     on either side of the room to create stereo.

                                sultry woman (o.s.)
                  an authentic cowboy outfit...
                  complete with six-guns!

     west turns to see who busted him. coming his way is a
     ravishing chinese girl dressed up as a dragon lady.

                                dragon lady
                  what a terribly clever costume,
                  mr...?

                                 west
                  ... west.   jim west.

                                dragon lady
                  well... west meets east. mae lee
                  east.
                         (holds out
                          delicate hand)
                  are you here alone, mr. west?

                                west
                  actually i'm, uh trying to
                  surprise an old friend -- general
                  mcgrath. seen him around
                  anywhere?

                                miss east (dragon lady)
                  i don't believe that name was on
                  our guest list. and i would know.
                  i'm dr. loveless's personal
                  assistant.

     the name means something to west.

                                                      (continued)

                                                              36.

                                west
                  dr. arliss loveless...? one of
                  the great founders of the
                  confederacy with jefferson davis.
                  funny how most people think he's
                  dead.

                                miss east
                  tonight's his coming-out party.

     we follow them as she takes his arm and leads him down
     the stairs, into the party.
