      now they hear a strange sound. to modern ears, a whine
      as from a jet engine. loveless appears in the f.g. he's
      rising on a steel platform as if on some unseen elevator.
      up, up, up he goes... as now more of the contraption comes
      into view. alloy girders, multi-levels, control boards...
      all open in an eiffel tower-like effect.

      west and gordon scramble for cover behind a rock as a
      giant metal tarantula steps over the rim in full
      terrifying glory. eight legs, five stories high.

      the thorax of the giant spider bristles with gatling guns
      and all manner of weaponry. as the shadow of the monster
      passes over their faces...

                                 gordon
                   now that's impressive.

                                 west
                   nice to see an invention that
                   actually works.
