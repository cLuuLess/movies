177   int. loveless's lair - amphitheater - dusk                       177

      a candle-powered spotlight swings across the stage and
      illuminates... a deep-throated, bluesy black chanteuse
      who starts singing the popular cathouse song, "hangtown
      gals."

                                 chanteuse
                          (singing)
                   'ohhh... hangtown gals are plump
                   and rosy...'

      loveless wheels his chair around to take a gander and
      forgets gordon's execution instantly. and why not?
      she's young and beautiful in a rupaul sort of way. about
      six feet tall, wearing the blue sequined number gordon
      had in his dressing room.

      accessorized with black mesh stockings, big feather boa,
      silver-buckled belt, lots of frilly petticoats for those
      can-can moves.

                                 chanteuse
                          (singing)
                   'hair in ringlets, mighty cozy...'

      she winds her finger around her ringlets and sticks out
      her derriere to the crowd. they stare, mouths agape at
      this piece of ass worthy of othello.


      close - loveless

      intrigued.    well, maybe more than intrigued.

                                  loveless
                   a new girl!   what a nice surprise!

      he motions to hold up gordon's execution, rolls to her.

                                  chanteuse
                   'painted cheeks and frilly
                   corsets.'
                          (bends over showing
                           her undergarment)
                   touch them...'

      loveless hears this as an invitation, reaches out with
      his hand and whap! she slaps him right in the face.

                                 chanteuse
                   '... and they'll sting like
                   hornets!'

                                                         (continued)

                                                                98.

177   continued:                                                      177

      there's a hush in the crowd. loveless, a red handprint
      on his face, is a little nonplussed. amazonia moves in
      threateningly, but loveless stops her, starts to laugh.

                                 loveless
                          (making her name up
                           on the spot)
                   ebonia! why are you so cruel to
                   me?

      ebonia has escaped a head-cutting neck bracelet. but she
      probably shouldn't be teasing a man who's having "ghost
      aches" in certain amputated places.


      angle - gordon

      waiting to be executed.    something's not quite kosher
      about her for gordon.

                                 gordon
                          (musing to himself)
                   i have a dress like that.


      angle - chanteuse

      now with the crowd singing along, she pulls out all the
      stops. her gestures and dance moves become more
      exaggerated, she's in the thrall of her audience.

                                 chanteuse
                          (singing)
                   'hangtown gals are lovely
                     creatures
                   think they'll marry mormon
                     preachers.'

      she sashays over to the french dignitary, pulls his
      monocle out of his eye and blows hot breath on it,
      steaming it up. as she pops it back on his face...

                                 chanteuse
                          (singing)
                   'heads thrown back to show their
                   features...'

      now she puts her cheek next to rita as if matching their
      relative beauty while picking the pocket of lippenreider.

      rita pushes her away disgustedly but not before ebonia
      hands coleman the keys to the cuffs. coleman looks from
      the keys to ebonia. he just caught on.

                                                      (continued)

                                                                 99.

177   continued:    (2)                                                177

                                 coleman
                   go, ebonia, go.

      then ebonia prances on stage to gordon, cuddles up to
      him. gordon looks at the big beautiful black woman with
      a mixture of amusement and relief. of course, it's his
      "i'd rather be dead" partner, jim west.

                                 west
                          (singing)
                   ha... ha... hangtown girls...

                                 gordon
                   not to sound ungrateful, but you're
                   a little over the top.

                                  west
                          (sings)
                   ha... ha... ha...

      west/ebonia wraps the feather boa around gordon's neck --
      hiding the derringer in the palm of his hand. gordon looks
      worried. what's he going to do with a gun? as he tucks
      it up his sleeve...

                                 gordon
                   let me warn you about that
                   dress...

                                 west
                   gotta go. big finish...
                          (belts it out)
                   'ha, ha, ha! hangtown gals!!!'

      an immediate standing ovation. the diversion allows
      coleman to unlock both grant's and rita's shackles.
      grant looks at the keys.

                                 president grant
                   where'd those come from...?

                                 coleman
                          (nods to ebonia)
                   captain west.

      their eyes practically pop out of their heads.

                                 rita
                   she's... no...!


      angle - ebonia/west

      one more time.

                                                         (continued)

      the wild wild west - rev. 7/1/98                         100.

177   continued:    (3)                                               177

                                 west
                          (singing)
                   'ha, ha, ha... hang... town...
                   girls!!!'

      suddenly the tassels on his bosoms are spinning to the
      delight of the crowd.

                                 west
                          (suddenly blinks)
                   wait a minute. what the hell
                   is this?

      he stops, but his tassels are still spinning on their
      own.
