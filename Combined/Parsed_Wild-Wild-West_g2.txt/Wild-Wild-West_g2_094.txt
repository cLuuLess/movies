103   ext. tracks - train chase - pov from back of moving           103

      wanderer heading for loveless's tank/train.


104   insert                                                        104

      suddenly there's a ping! bong! ping! pop! the teeth
      of the gears can't take the pressure and they're flying
      off the winch.
