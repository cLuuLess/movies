175   int. wanderer - parlor car - west - same time                   175

      stumbles in and looks around discouraged.

      the place has been ransacked. the gun cabinets are
      empty, the gatling lamp removed. all that's left is
      gordon's nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses.

      west tries every secret hiding place. nothing. finally
      he finds gordon's belt buckle/derringer. he opens the
      breech. only one dinky bullet. he throws down the belt
      in disgust.
