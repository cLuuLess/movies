                   well, isn't this a coincidence!
                   i'm out for a little mornin' ride,
                   and right in the middle of
                   nowhere, i bump into general
                   ulysses s. grant himself!
                          (leans over edge,
                           mocking salute)

                   introduced. i'm dr. arliss
                   loveless, formerly with the
                   confederate army.
