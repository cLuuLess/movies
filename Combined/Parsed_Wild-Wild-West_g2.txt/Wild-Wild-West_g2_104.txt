115   int. loveless's train - engine - day                           115

      loveless has only a moment to gloat over his marksmanship
      before the compartment begins filling with smoke.
      choking clouds that send loveless et al into coughing
      fits.

                              loveless
                close the fire door!

      just in time, amazonia swings it shut as the unvented
      boiler explodes, sending a fireball ripping through the
      back of the train, destroying it. up ahead...
