12   int. fat-can's - night (same time)                            12

     general mcgrath checks a pocket watch, looks up
     impatiently at the indian, hudson. his eyes drift
     upwards... to the balcony where...


     angle on upstairs balcony - two more ex-rebs

     have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk.

                             mcgrath
               i'm still waiting on my guns and
               ammo, but i see my men have
               brought your merchandise.

     mcgrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for
     hudson to confirm. hudson nods.

                             mcgrath
               i had expected to be delivering it
               personally to mr...

     hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name.
     the indian speaks in a very precise king's english.

                              hudson
               my employer, here in a brothel?
                      (a small ironic
                       smile)
               that would be quite... redundant.
