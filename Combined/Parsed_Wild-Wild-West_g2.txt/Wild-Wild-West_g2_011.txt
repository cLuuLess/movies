11   ext. warehouse skylight - night                                11

     west crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. the
     only people more shocked than he is are the guards and
     the rebs he just dropped in on. west picks himself up,
     smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws.

                             west
               okay, who just made a wish?
               was it you?

     he looks up at the freaked-out saloon girl, still in the
     tank. she hangs on with one hand, the other hand
     clutches his clothes.

                             west
               i could sure use those clothes
               now.

     she responds by frisbee-ing his hat down. west picks it
     up, with a look... uses it to cover his genitals.

                                                     (continued)

                                big reb
                  well, we got us a shy nig...

     but he never gets that word out. bang! west lashes a
     lightning martial arts kick to the reb's jaw.

                                west
                  fought five long years with the
                  union army not to hear that word
                  again. and you boys lost,
                  remember?

     as the other reb comes at him, he spins, still holding
     the hat in front of him... and whap! down that one goes.
     west looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.

                                west
                  how 'bout some pants!?

     as she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap...

                                                              5.
