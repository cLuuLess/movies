178   int. loveless's lair - amphitheater - dusk                      178

      immediately two flame throwers explode from his cone-like
      bosoms.

      maybe he should've listened about the dress. he turns to
      gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of
      loveless's goons. he howls in pain, runs panicked...
      right into rita.

                                 rita
                   serves you right for staring at
                   them.

      as she relieves the charred goon of his keys... loveless
      turns to the rest of his goons.

                                 loveless
                   kill him!
                          (off their confused
                           looks, points)
                   him! him! the girl!

      finally getting it, they rush ebonia. even his 4th of
      july breasts aren't a match for them. desperate, west
      reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of
      gordon's billiard balls. he depresses the number and
      rolls it at the guards.

                                 gordon
                   was that the eight ball?

                                 west
                   mmm-hmm.

      gordon grabs west and rita, pulls them behind the bar.

                                                     (continued)

      the wild wild west - rev. 7/1/98                         101.

178   continued:                                                      178

                                 gordon
                   that one's an incendiary bomb.

      ka-boooom! an explosion rips the place and a santa ana-
      sized fire starts immediately.

      rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a
      bearded scientist.

                                 west/gordon
                   rita!

      she unlocks his neck collar, turns to them and smiles.

                                 rita
                          (disappearing into
                           the chaos)
                   meet me after the show!

      both west and gordon look after her with yearning as
      three goons charge them. coleman, amazed at their
      torpor, quickly grabs a rifle from the incinerated goon
      and opens fire. blam! blam! blam!

      three goons drop. gordon and west exchange looks.
      not bad for an emphysemic old engineer.

                                 coleman
                   special marshal... president
                   thought you needed some lookin'
                   after.

      speaking of the president... he's grabbed a dead goon's
      rifle, and is laying down a pretty good field of fire
      himself. suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from
      behind. it's amazonia. whap, she sends a right to his
      chin knocking him out. she throws him over her shoulder
      and carries him away.
