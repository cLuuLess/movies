151   ext. promontory point - close on golden spike - day           151

      being held in the stubby fingers of ulysses s. grant.
      he's reading an inscription on it.

                              president grant (o.s.)
                may god continue the unity of our
                country...

      camera pulls back to reveal a crowd present to watch
      president grant knock in the famous spike. behind him,
      two train engines are facing each other. the detectives
      scan the crowd for possible trouble.

                              president grant
                ... as this railroad unites the
                two great oceans of this world.

      now he swings back the sledgehammer... but at the top of
      his swing...


      close - spike

      starts to shake, wiggle, and actually pop out of its
      hole. very curious. as it begins to hop on the ground,
      bounced by a resounding thumping...


      angle on grant and crowd

      look across the desert to see...
