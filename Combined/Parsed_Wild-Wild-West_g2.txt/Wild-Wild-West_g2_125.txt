       gordon, lips parched, clothes tattered, peers impatiently
       over the metal collar as west works on it with some lock
       picks. west's collar is already off.

                                 west
                   why didn't you tell me you had an
                   'auxiliary' tool kit?

                                 gordon
                   i did tell you, but in your zeal
                   to run and leap off a two-hundred-
                   foot cliff, i don't think you
                   heard me.

      west eats the grilled gila monster voraciously. and
      eats. and enjoys it more. and eats. he notices gordon
      watching him.

                                 west
                   what?!

      gordon looks to the heavens and recites.

                                 gordon
                   '... take physic, pomp; expose
                   thyself to feel what wretches
                   feel, that thou mayst shake the
                   superflux to them, and show the
                   heavens more just.'

      gordon's quote has gone on.       and on.   and on.   he notices
      west watching him.

                                 gordon
                   what?!

                                 west
                   you know, gordon, you can be quite
                   annoying -- flaunting that fancy
                   education.

                                 gordon
                   well, truth be told, i never had a
                   fancy education -- not a formal
                   one, anyway.

                                 west
                          (looks at gordon's
                           ring)
                   the harvard thing seems pretty
                   formal to me.

                                 gordon
                   this ring? this ring isn't real.
                   do you want it?

                                 gordon (cont'd)
                          (takes ring off and
                           tosses it into fire)
                   a prop. i'm an actor. or was. i
                   gave it up. i went by the name of
                   arthur gordon. ever hear of me?

                                 west
                   no. how did you wind up in this
                   line of work?

                                 gordon
                   the pinnacle of my life in the
                   theater came in a production of
                   our american cousin -- a light
                   comedy -- at ford's theater in
                   washington. there was this one
                   line i had... always got the
                   biggest laugh in the show. one
                   night, it drowned out the
                   gunshot that killed president
                   lincoln.
                          (beat)
                   i decided to devote my talents to
                   making sure that never happened
                   again.


      close - tarantula

      walks slowly across west's outstretched hand.

                                 gordon
                   uh... there's a spider on your
                   hand. doesn't that bother you?

                                 west
                   she doesn't want any trouble.
                   she's just trying to get warm.

      he puts the spider down into the sand.

                                 gordon
                   how come you know so much about
                   the desert, anyway?

                                 west
                   the indians taught me. i lived
                   out here when i was a boy.

      gordon starts to ask west something but west doesn't want
      him to pry further.

                                 west
                   hey -- watch --

      he points toward a small black wasp flying from above.

                                 west
                   the desert wasp... one of the
                   world's great hunters. she'll
                   kill the tarantula -- and lay her
                   eggs on it, so her babies can have
                   something to eat.

                                 gordon
                   now i'm really hungry.
                          (beat)
                   how did your parents, who i assume
                   were negroes, feel about you being
                   raised by indians?

                                 west
                   they didn't have much to say about
                   it. i was sent to another
                   plantation when i was little. ran
                   away as soon as my legs were
                   strong enough to take me.

      west can see the effect his story has had on gordon.

                                 gordon
                   did you ever see your family
                   again?

                   yeah...
                          (stands, kicks
                            out fire)
                   they were at the camp at new
                   liberty.

      now they both stare into the fire.    finally gordon
      speaks.

                                 gordon
                   i'll help you get him, jim.
