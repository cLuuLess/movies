205   ext. tarantula - bridge - dusk                                  205

      gordon watches in a tortured sweat as his partner tries
      to hold off the metal foot. but he's slowly losing.
      gordon turns to his female captors, throws his arms out
      beseechingly. when he does, the derringer comes snapping
      out of his sleeve in the device which normally holds his
      pen.

                                 gordon
                   stop this violence!

      gordon blinks at the gun. so do lippenreider and
      amazonia. grant knows what to say, if gordon doesn't.

                                   president grant
                   drop 'em.

      they obey, chucking their guns overboard.
