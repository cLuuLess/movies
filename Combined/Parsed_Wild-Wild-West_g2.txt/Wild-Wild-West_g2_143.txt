      loveless, squinting down at the two grants. this new
      wrinkle has also attracted the attention of the
      love-lettes and everyone else aboard.

                                 loveless
                   now just who are you?

                                  gordon/grant
                   the president.
                          (turns to president,
                           snorts)
                   he's just an actor hired to stand
                   in for me on public occasions. a
                   very bad actor, i must say... a
                   little puffy and overweight.

      as the president eyes him, puffs on his cigar,
      gordon/grant apes his every move, bigger, mockingly.

                          (aside)
                   gordon, you've got a lot of brass.
                   where's west?

                                 gordon
                   you know him, sir...

      gordon/grant shifts his eyes toward...
