      munitia is bent over, has her eye to the cannon sight.
      as she squints through the smoke at the wanderer up ahead,
      loveless, sitting behind her, has his full attention
      focused on her tuchus.

                              munitia
                i have them square in my sights,
                sire.

                              loveless
                       (distracted)
                as do i, munitia... as do i.
                       (looks up, wry smile)
                fire away!

      but it's a little difficult with him stroking her
      buttocks. boom! the cannon fires...
