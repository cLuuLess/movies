125   ext. cornfield - perimeter - west - day                        125

      stands next to the little fence, watching loveless
      escape.

                              west
                i don't have time for this.

                              gordon
                wait, i have an auxiliary tool
                kit!

      gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it. but
      it's too late. west has jumped over the fence. then he
      hops back inside it. he holds his hands out to gordon.

                                 west
                see?     nothing happened.

      west grabs gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him
      over the fence. now they hear a slight buzzing in the
      air and it's not a bee.


      new angle - disc

      comes whipping over the corn straight for west's head.
      in a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of
      the corn off and banks around for a new attack.

                                 gordon
                oh, really...?

      now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start
      running like hell through the cornfield.

                              west
                is it too late to take it off of
                me now?
