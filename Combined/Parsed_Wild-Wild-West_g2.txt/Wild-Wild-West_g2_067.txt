     night

     west leans into gordon's ear.

68   continued:                                                      68

                                west
                  hang 'm...!

     suddenly, there's a volley of shots from some cracker
     sharpshooters. west responds with an amazing display of
     rapid-fire marksmanship, picking off half a dozen of
     loveless's shooters, even while the carriage bumps wildly
     on its getaway. blamblamblamblam!!!

                                west
                         (still pissed,
                          to gordon)
                  hang'm!?!

                                gordon
                         (to rita)
                  meet my trigger-happy partner,
                  james west... who doesn't seem to
                  realize that my carefully planned
                  diversion gave me the opportunity
                  to search for the missing
                  scientists.

     now west notices the half-dressed bombshell in the
     carriage.

                                west
                  scientist, huh.

                                gordon
                  this is rita. i found her locked
                  in a cage in loveless's bedroom.
                  she's an entertainer.

                                rita
                  um, maybe i haven't been quite
                  honest about that... my name is
                  rita escobar. i came to find
                  guillermo escobar, the scientist,
                  my... father.

     gordon's eyes pop.

                                 gordon
                  professor escobar?! he was the
                  one i almost rescued that night
                  when...
                          (lightbulb)
                  that's where i know you from!
                  fat-can candy's... you sang before
                  i did.

                                rita
                  excuse me?

                                                       (continued)

                                gordon
                  that was me. burgundy dress with
                  the bustle...

     gordon starts singing the song... west rolls his eyes,
     cuts off the chit-chat.

                                west
                  look, rita, i'm sorry you had the
                  wrong agent working on your case.
                  when i find your father i promise
                  i'll send him back safely...

     and with that... west suddenly leaps over rita -- lands
     on the back of one of the horses. he grabs a handful of
     mane, leans over and unclips the harness. and with a
     kick in the ribs, west is off at a gallop -- leaving
     gordon, one remaining horse and an awed rita behind to
     chew his dust.

                                rita
                  he's impulsive, james.
