                   maybe i should have stayed inside
                   that fence another moment or two.

       west and gordon, caked in mud, are coming up a ridge,
       below which is a stream.

                               west
                 all right, gordon, what's your
                 plan? how are you gonna get this
                 damn thing off my neck?

       gordon turns to west, simmering, controlling himself.

                               gordon
                 excuse me?

                               west
                 isn't that why you're here?
                 'cause you're the master of,
                 you know, mechanical stuff?

                               gordon
                        (smiles)
                 oh. oh, i see. now i'm the master
                 of... 'mechanical stuff.' as opposed
                 to five minutes ago, when i was trying
                 to collect my thoughts and figure
                 out a way to get us out of these
                 contraptions! but no!

       gordon starts moving towards west, who is forced to back
       up -- looking a tad nervous for the first time in the
       movie.

                               gordon
                 -- that wouldn't have been any
                 fun for a certain somebody, and i
                 won't mention any names -- jim
                 west! -- who decided to take me on
                 a bracing romp through a cornfield
                 and play a fanciful game of hide
                 and seek with serrated, spinning
                 death discs, while our only mode
                 of transportation is in the hands
                 of a sadistic madman with weapons
                 of mass destruction, who kidnapped
                 rita, and is on his way to kill
                 our president and take over the
                 country!

                               west
                 hey, calm down, gordon...

                            lost it)
                    no! because i'm the 'master of
                    mechanical stuff!' and i have to
                    help you! because you're the

                                     west

                                  gordon
                    you want to get that collar off?
                    fine! let's do it the fun, jim
                    west way!
                           (picks up a rock)
                    let's bash it with a rock!

                                  west
                    gordon, you don't want to do that.

                                     gordon
                           (crazy)
                    oh, but i do.

       gordon grabs a rock and smashes west's collar.
       suddenly --

       ziiiinng! west's collar emits a low hum. suddenly,
       west is thrown into gordon, their collars locking.
       clang!

                                  gordon
                           (suddenly calm)
                    that's odd. what did you do?

                                  west
                    i didn't do shit!

                                  gordon
                    no, you must've reversed the
                    polarity of the magnets.

                                  west
                    i did not do shit!
                           (he's had enough)
                    that's it --

       west lifts his leg to gordon's collar to push him
       away, but then -- clang! the stiletto in his shoe
       dislodges and instantly sticks to gordon's magnetic
       collar.

       for a mega-millisecond, west -- his foot stuck to his
       partner's neck -- is stunned. but before he knows what
       even happened, west flips upside down onto his shoulders.

                                  gordon
                    are you all right?

                                  west
                    oh, i'm peachey. now help me get
                    my boot off!

       first, gordon -- trying to get some leverage -- puts his
       foot in west's crotch and pulls the boot.

                                   west
                    ahhhh!

                                  gordon
                    apologies, apologies.

       gordon struggles to free the writhing west from the boot
       (attached to gordon's collar).

       finally, west's foot comes free. but when he sits up
       -- thwap! his collar is sucked into gordon's belt buckle.
       west is face to face with his partner's crotch.

                                  west
                    do me a favor. when you're
                    telling this story to your
                    grandkids, leave this part out.

                                   gordon
                    don't worry.

       west starts unbuttoning gordon's belt.

                                  west
                    now, when i undo your belt,
                    i'm going to run as fast as i
                    can that way, and you run as
                    fast as you can the other way.
                    understand?

                                  gordon
                    you're going to run as fast as
                    you can one way and i'm going to
                    run as fast as i can the other...?
                    ingenious.

                                  west
                    one... two...

       the men run in opposite directions. (gordon's belt on
       west's collar, west's boot on gordon's). they get about
       thirty, forty yards. then --

       they're yanked backwards into each other.

       splash! they fall in the water -- back to back. every
       time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is
       under water.

                                  west
                           (rolling face up)
                    get off me, you steaming pile of
                    (gurgle)!

                                               (rolling face upgurgle)        you!

                                           (rolling face upgurgle)    yourself!

       finally they roll out of the stream and onto dry land.
       they sit up, out of breath, stuck together, back to back.

                                  west
                    i do not want to spend the rest
                    of my life looking like a meatball
                    on a plate.

                                  gordon
                    we're going to have to discuss
                    bathroom etiquette soon. very
                    soon.

       angle on tool kit

       bobbing in the stream.    gordon grabs it out of the water.

                                  gordon
                    aha. my auxiliary tool kit.
                    i forgot all about it. it must've
                    slipped out of my pocket.

                                  west
                    your pocket? why wasn't it
                    attached to some spring-loaded
                    something-or-other that shoots
                    out of your ass?
