    west is unaware that she's watching him, not watching
    her.

                 jim!

                               west
                 ah, this hole is a safety issue.
                 i'm thinking, what if it starts to
                 rain and the water level goes up.
                 it could suck you right up. i'm
                 protecting you. (variations)

    saloon girl frustrated, has grabbed west's boxer shorts
    (with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with
    them.

                               saloon girl
                 problem solved.

                               west
                 belle, you don't just ram a man's
                 underbritches into a knothole.
                 you wanna plug the hole, you ram
                 your own britches in there.

    west is at a loss.    she moves in for another kiss.
