138   ext. utah - desert - morning                                   138

      west and gordon trudge through an endless sand dune,
      side by side, chests out, jaws set. they're partners,
      goddammit!

                                  gordon
                   you have no idea where you're
                   going, do you?

                                 west
                   i know exactly where i'm goin'
                   ... spider canyon.

      gordon stops to catch his breath.

                                 west
                          (stops, looks back)
                   but i'm never gonna get there
                   with you draggin' that damn
                   thing around!

      now we see gordon's got the heavy metal collar in his hand.
      west grabs him and they start to walk away -- gordon
      listing noticeably.

                                 gordon
                   while a magneto of this power
                   may not inspire your scientific
                   curiosity, it does mine. besides,
                   you never know when it might come
                   in handy.

      gordon suddenly disappears out of frame. west stops
      to see what's happened to his partner now...

                                                       (continued)

      the wild wild west - rev. 8/28/98                           84.

138   continued:                                                        138

      angle - gordon

      he's on his back, arm holding the metal doughnut
      straight out over his head, being dragged across the
      desert floor by some unseen force.

      gordon snowplows backwards through the sand for 40 feet,
      finally coming to an abrupt stop with a metallic klang!

      west deadpans this bit of insanity, walks over, and with
      the toe of his boot, uncovers the explanation -- iron
      railroad tracks covered by drifting sand.

                                 west
                   arte... when you're right, you're
                   right.

                                 gordon
                   well i think our partnership is
                   taking a big step forward. you
                   finally admitted i was right about
                   something.

      west helps him up. then, as or two heroes follow the
      tracks into the distance... towards spider canyon...

                                 gordon
                   now... how about admitting you
                   were lost?

                                    west
                   don't push it.
