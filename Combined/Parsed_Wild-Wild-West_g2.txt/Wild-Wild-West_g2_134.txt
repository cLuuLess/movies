      gordon's nitro-cycle is out.   gordon fusses with it and
      some canvas.

                              west
                ... a horse, i mean.

                              gordon
                       (distracted)
                yes... i know how to ride a horse.
                when the situation calls for
                something primitive.

                                 west
                   how about now? there's a big
                   spider stompin' towards our
                   president!

      but gordon won't be hurried. he has a big book out,
      studies it, then looks back to his nitro-cycle.

                                 gordon
                   i was just thinking about another
                   spider. remember in the desert,
                   when that little wasp killed the
                   tarantula...?

      west rolls his eyes impatiently.

                                west
                   yeah. well, the wasp had a small
                   advantage. it could fly.

                                 gordon
                   exactly!

      gordon excitedly shows the book to west. pictured is an
      archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft. west looks at
      it in disbelief as gordon prattles on manically.

                                 gordon
                   in 1540, leonardo da vinci
                   invented a flying machine called
                   the 'ornithopter.' though he
                   never actually flew it...

      west's heard enough.    he grabs gordon, shakes him.

                                 west
                   artemus! there's no time for
                   plans or half-cocked inventions!
                   they don't work. we gotta stick
                   to what we're each good at!

      as west drags gordon to the wardrobe...
