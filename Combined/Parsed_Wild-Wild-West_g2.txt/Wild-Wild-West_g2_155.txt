174   int. loveless's lair - amphitheater - dusk (same time)          174

      loveless continues his speech to the foreign contingent.

                                 loveless
                          (looks to hudson
                           the indian)
                   manhattan for a handful of beads?
                          (raises his hand;
                           injun-style)
                   how?
                          (to the mexicans)
                   remember the alamo indeed!
                          (humbly to crowd)
                   today i'm proud to be able to sit
                   before you and tell you the wrongs
                   will be righted... the past made
                   present... the united, divided!

      to thunderous applause. loveless signals for the flag to
      be pulled down, revealing...


      angle on map of "the de-united states"

      there have been some significant internal changes which
      loveless now describes. the delegation from each country
      stands when they hear their name.

                                 loveless
                   great britain gets back the
                   thirteen original colonies...
                   minus manhattan.
                          (off applause)
                   florida and the fountain of youth
                   go back to spain!
                          (off applause)
                   texas, new mexico, california,
                   arizona revolve a mexico!
                          (off applause)
                   and the louisiana purchase reverts
                   back to the king of france!

      in the front row rita leans over to gordon.

                                 rita
                   queen of spain. king of france.
                   i was close.

                                                        (continued)

                                                                95.

174   continued:                                                      174

                                  munitia
                           (jostles her)
                   shut up and listen to a real
                   genius!

      finally loveless taps colorado, kansas, utah and nevada
      -- now labelled as "loveless land." smiles impishly.

                                 loveless
                   and a tiny piece for me to retire
                   on.

      there's appreciative laughter.
