36   int. white house - oval office - side doorway -                 36
     president grant - day

     (the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips,
     surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn.
     west nudges the fake grant in the fake belly with his gun
     barrel -- go ahead. sheepishly, gordon starts peeling
     off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics.

                                gordon
                  sir, in perilous times like these,
                  i was simply illustrating how
                  someone impersonating you could
                  actually walk right into the very
                  bowels of the white house...

     just as gordon makes his intestinal allusion, west takes
     a ceremonial bayonet off grant's desk and pokes a hole in
     the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch. the air
     hisses out, finishes deflating with a flatulent r-r-rip.
     (hey, the first whoopee cushion?)

     gordon scowls at him.

                                president grant
                  you're clever, gordon. one day
                  it'll get you killed.

     west smirks as grant looks up at the bullet hole in the
     ceiling, then fixes west with a disapproving eye.

                                president grant
                  ... and you, west -- not every
                  situation calls for your patented
                  approach of shoot first, shoot
                  later, shoot again -- then when
                  they're all dead, try to ask a
                  question or two.
                         (shakes his head)
                  working together will be good for
                  both of you.

                                                       (continued)

                                west and gordon
                  but, sir, i work...

                                president grant
                  you work the way your commander in
                  chief tells you to work.

     grant turns and exits frame.
