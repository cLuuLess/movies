        ext. city - bird's eye view - night                     55

        the spinner skirts through the canyons of the city.
        deckard, sitting in the contoured seat, watches the
        maze of suspension bridges, platforms and catwalks
        swing by below.  the tops of larger buildings shimmer
        with advertisements and weather announcements.
