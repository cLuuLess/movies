        int. tyrell den - night                                 90

        tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk.  sebastian
        hands down the invoices.  tyrell glances over them and
        writes out a check.

        he looks up to hand it over when he sees batty against
        the wall, by the door.  for a fraction of a second he's
        shocked, but recovers fast.

                                tyrell
                  a friend of yours, sebastian?

                                sebastian
                  yes, this is someone who wants to
                  talk to you, dr. tyrell.

        batty smiles.

                                batty
                  the name is batty.  roy batty.

                                tyrell
                  oh?

        very slowly tyrell's hand moves towards the back side
        of the desk.

                                batty
                  to act without understanding could
                  lead to the very thing the act
                  seeks to avoid.

        what's in batty's eyes completes the warning.  tyrell
        decides to heed it.

                                batty
                  a little talk it all i need.

        tyrell looks at sebastian.  considers consequences.
        back to batty.

                                tyrell
                  would you like to talk in private
                  then.

        batty thinks it over.

                                batty
                  yeah.  it might be better if we
                  talk in private, sebastian.  why
                  don't you go home.

                                tyrell
                  here's your check, my boy.  thank
                  you.

                                sebastian
                  thank you, dr. tyrell.  i'll see
                  you later.

        he slips out closing the door behind him.  opens it
        again and sticks his head it.

                                sebastian
                  was everything okay?

                                tyrell
                  just beautiful.

        he's gone.

        if tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing
        it.

                                tyrell
                  i'm surprised you didn't come to
                  me sooner.

                                batty
                  it's not an easy thing to meet
                  your maker.

                                tyrell
                  and what can he do for you?

                                batty
                  can the maker repair what he makes?

                                tyrell
                  would you like to be modified?

                                batty
                  had in mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                tyrell
                  what's the problem?

                                batty
                  death.

                                tyrell
                  i'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        batty cuts in with a whisper.

                                batty
                  i want more life, fucker.

                                tyrell
                  come here.

        batty walks forward.

                                tyrell
                  sit down.

        batty does.

                                tyrell
                  the facts of life.  i'll be blunt.
                  to make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, it fatal.  a coding sequence
                  can't be revised once it's
                  established.

                                batty
                  why?

                                tyrell
                  because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation give
                  rise to revertant colonies -- like
                  rats leaving a sinking ship.  the
                  ship sinks.

                                batty
                  what about e.m.s. recombination?

                                tyrell
                  we've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  creates a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        batty nods grimly.

                                batty
                  then a repressor protein that blocks
                  the operating cells.

                                tyrell
                  wouldn't obstruct replication, but
                  it does give rise to an error in
                  replication, so that the newly
                  formed dna strand carries a
                  mutation and you're got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic
                  -- you are made as good as we could
                  make you.

                                batty
                  but not to last.

                                tyrell
                  put it this way.  rolls royces are
                  made to last -- as least they were.
                  but i'm afraid you're a ferrari.
                  a high strung racing car -- built
                  to win, not to last.

        batty smiles bitterly.

                                tyrell
                  also you're too valuable to
                  experiment with.

                                batty
                  i am?

        tyrell can't help a flash of pride.

                                tyrell
                  the bast of all possible androids.
                  we're proud of our prodigal son --
                  glad you're returned.  you're quite
                  a prize.

        shoulders hunched, batty looks down, an uncharacteristic
        note of guilt in his voice.

                                batty
                  i've done some questionable things.

                                tyrell
                  also extraordinary things.

                                batty
                  nothing the god of biomechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        they share a laugh.  in spite of himself, there's a look
        of relief in tyrell's face as batty extends his hand.
        tyrell takes it and they shake.  the reverence in bat-
        ty's eyes caused tyrell a fatherly smile.  the smile
        turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands
        crack.  before the scream comes out of his mouth, batty
        stifles it.

        tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking
        into his face.  placing his other hand behind tyrell's
        head, batty squeezes them together and squashes the
        man's head like a melon.  the mess is not small.

        palms up, like a surgeon, batty walks to the drapes and
        wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out
        of the room.
