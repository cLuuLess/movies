        in the sink the faucet is on.  the water pink with
        blood.  batty is washing his hands.

        a portly maid emerges from the pantry.  batty looks up.
        she stops, embarrassed at being caught.  her eyes no-
        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the
        door.  when she looks back, batty is right in front of
        her.
