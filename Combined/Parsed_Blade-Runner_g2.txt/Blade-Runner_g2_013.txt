        the companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
        more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
        outs of this establishment.  but deckard finds the door
        he's looking for.  he pauses a moment, listens, then
        knocks.  he inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
        opens it.
