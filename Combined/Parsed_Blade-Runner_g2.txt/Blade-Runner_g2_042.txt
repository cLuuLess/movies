        int. tunnel - night                                     42

        in the dusenberg the driver turns to look at the passen-
        ger, his specter-like face obscured by shadow, but by
        the glint of teeth, he must have just smiled.  and the
        passenger's view snaps back to the road.

        suddenly another pair of headlights round the approach-
        ing bend.  large ones, of a bus or a truck.  blinding.

        the dusenberg is going too fast to stop.  no room to
        pass.  horns blast.  the dusenberg brakes, goes into a
        broadside skid.  the hands of the passenger reach out
        and grip the mahogany dash.  brakes locked, tires
        screaming, skidding.  the dusenberg tears through the
        railing and plunges into space.  the last view of the
        passenger is pure vertigo.  silence.
