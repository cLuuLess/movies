        int. doctor wheeler's office - afternoon                43

        the good doctor is bending over his glass-top desk which
        resembles a pin-ball machine.  displayed under its
        surface is a network of crisp electronic symbols and
        read-outs indicating the results of the test.

        deckard detached the patches from his forehead, which
        it a little damp, but other than that, he looks no
        worse for wear, stands up to stretch and walks over to
        the doctor's desk.

                                deckard
                  so how did i do?

        dr. wheeler is a thin boney man, aloof but a promise
        of compassion in his sunken eyes.

                                wheeler
                  nerves of steel.

                                deckard
                  no rust?

                                wheeler
                  i didn't say that.  your motivity
                  rate checked out a little slower
                  than last time.

                                deckard
                  meaning?

                                wheeler
                  meaning you don't run as fast as
                  you used to.

        deckard starts to dress.

                                wheeler
                  during the road test...

                                deckard
                  yeah?

                                wheeler
                  your mind kept wandering.  that
                  bothered me.

                                deckard
                  huh huh.

                                wheeler
                  considering the nature of your
                  work, that could be unhealthy.

                                deckard
                  true.

        wheeler studies his "desk" for a moment and his finger
        comes down on the section illuminating deckard's simple
        statistics.

                                wheeler
                  you got a birthday coming up.

        deckard bends over slipping on his shoes.  wheeler looks
        up, concerned.

                                wheeler
                  but you haven't put in for
                  emigration.

                                deckard
                  nope.

                                wheeler
                  you're going to be over the limit.

                                deckard
                  listen, i could make you a long
                  list of complaints about this
                  fucken city but i still rather be
                  here than up there.

                                wheeler
                  what if you change your mind?

                                deckard
                  they'll change the limit before
                  i change my mind.

                                wheeler
                  you sure?

                                deckard
                  never been more sure of anything
                  in my life.

        deckard is ready to go.  looking at wheeler, a little
        touched with his concern.

                                deckard
                  why didn't you go?

                                wheeler
                  too old.

                                deckard
                  but if you could?

        wheeler considers it a moment, smiles and shakes his head.

                                wheeler
                  my job is here.

                                deckard
                  me too.

        they shake hands and deckard walks.
