        int. sebastian's apartment - night                      94

        sebastian is putting his work table in order, but his
        mind is not with it and his hands are trembling.

        batty, pris and mary are on the other side of the room
        talking:  their voices low.

                                mary
                  let's go while there is still
                  time.

                                batty
                  where?

                                mary
                  anywhere.

        batty smiles.

                                batty
                  what's the point?

                                mary
                  not to be trapped.

                                batty
                  you underestimate the trap, mary.

        sebastian has almost reached the door.

                                batty
                  where are you going, sebastian?

                                sebastian
                  just thought i'd...

                                batty
                  no, you stay here with us.  out
                  last night together.

        they all watch.

        sebastian walks away from the door.

                                batty
                  think of yourself as a light, mary.
                  shine before you're turned off.

        she's too fragile for that logic, but it appeals to
        pris.  she and batty hold a look that burns.

        sebastian is by the window.

                                sebastian
                  someone is coming here.

        batty goes to the window and looks down.

                                batty
                  one man.
                         (he smiles)
                  he must be good.

                                mary
                  then go get him.

                                batty
                  that wouldn't be very sporting.

        sebastian looks ready to bolt.  batty puts an arm
        around him.

                                pris
                  i want to do it.

                                batty
                  okay, but don't kill him.  save a
                  little for everybody.  a
                  masterpiece.

        a pause.

                                batty
                  turn out the lights, pris.
