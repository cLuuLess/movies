        steps into the dark on the other side.  suddenly he
        spins, dropping to the floor, and fires three times in-

        the man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into
        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his
        chest... but he was already dead.

        deckard stares at the corpse.  it's mr. deetchum, the
        old watchman.  that rustling sound are rats who were
        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, deckard
        gets to his feet.

        the stairway rectangles ten stories up.  as his foot
        touches the first step, a raw, terrified scream shatters
        the air.  it came from below.  it's the cry of a young
        girl -- it grows to a piercing shriek and abruptly
        stops.  deckard ejects the half-used cartridge from his
        laser, inserts a fresh one and quiet as the silence,
        descends the basement stairs.
