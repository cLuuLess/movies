        int. deckard's apartment - night                        54

        he's sitting in front of his console studying pictures
        of nexus sixes at they appear, blank-faced, hairless
        and unadorned on his monitor.

        the over-lay machine is transforming each image with
        instant attributes; hair, moustaches, teeth, eye colors,
        age, youth, hats, glasses, etc.  all in rapid succession,
        running the gambit from ominous to beautiful.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  the possibilities were infinite.
                  they could change their appearances
                  but not their future.
                  like she said, it was short.
                  longevity is what they were after.
                  the garbage man even wanted a past.
                  poor fuck.  i'd check it out but
                  i knew she was right.  the market
                  worked on turn-over.  built-in
                  obsolescence was the name of the
                  game.  that meant her too.  it
                  was something i didn't want to
                  think about.

        on top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with
        a spoon stuck in it.  deckard puts out his cigarette
        and reaches for them as the phone rings.

                                deckard
                  yeah.

                                bryant
                  bryant here.  regarding the
                  rundown you requested on job
                  applicants, esper's concluded that
                  the only irregular category that
                  tyrell's got is the entertainment
                  section.  you better get on it.

                                deckard
                  i was just about to have my dinner.

                                bryant
                  if you hurry you'll get back
                  before it gets cold.  i got a
                  spinner on your roof in five
                  minutes.  good luck.

        deckard hangs up and looks at the beans.  he didn't
        want them anyway.  he gets up and walks to the bedroom.
        looks through the pile of clothes on the floor, finds
        his ankle laser and straps it on.
