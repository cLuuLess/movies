        int. room - tenth floor - night                         107

        the full length mirror on the other side of the room
        shatters.  batty's next to him, grabs deckard's hand
        and steps in closer.

                                batty
                  straight doesn't seem to be good
                  enough.

        they're face to face.

                                batty
                  you don't have a chance, do you?

        in an exaggeration of weary disappointment, batty drops
        his head to the side.

                                batty
                  looks like i'm gonna have to scale
                  it down for you.  give you a
                  handicap.  i won't run through any
                  more walls.  okay?  i promise to
                  use the doors.  okay?

        deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  sud-
        denly fury storms through batty.  he throws deckard out
        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar
        and rams his head into the wall.

                                batty
                  come on, let's use that brain!
