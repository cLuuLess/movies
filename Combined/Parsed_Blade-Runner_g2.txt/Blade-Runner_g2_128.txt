        int. car - night                                        126

        deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-
        ing straight ahead.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  i told myself over and over again,
                  if i hadn't done it, they would
                  have.

                  i didn't go back to the city, not
                  that city, i didn't want the job.

                  she said the great advantage of
                  being alive was to have a choice.
                  and she chose.  and a part of me
                  was almost glad.  not because she
                  was gone but because this way they
                  could never touch her.

                  as for tyrell -- he was murdered,
                  but he wasn't dead.  for a long
                  time i wanted to kill him.  but
                  what was the point?  there were too
                  many tyrells.  but only one rachael.
                  maybe real and unreal could never
                  be separated.  the secret never
                  found.  but i got as close with
                  her as i'd ever come to it.  she'd
                  stay with me a long time.  i guess
                  we made each other real.

        and the ruby lights of deckard's car disappear into
        the darkness.
