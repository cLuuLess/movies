        int. hospital corridor and room - day                   77

        holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an
        iron lung.  a little above his head, facing him, is a
        bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions.

        deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend.

        holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't
        move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate
        the canary.

                                deckard
                  how are you doing, old man?

        holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper
        that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.

                                holden
                  i'm great.  i mean, i know i'm
                  not really great, but i feel just
                  great.  how you like my new suit?

                                deckard
                  well, you don't have to worry
                  about getting it wrinkled.

        holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little
        spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.

                                holden
                  don't make me laugh.  it makes me
                  pee.

                                deckard
                  sorry.

                                holden
                  hey, it's okay.  i like to pee.
                  so how are you doing?

                                deckard
                  i'm doing okay.

                                holden
                  from what i hear you're doing
                  great.  bryant tells me you're
                  going like a god damn one-man
                  army.  making a lot of money, huh?

                                deckard
                  yeah.
                         (pause)
                  but that's what i wanted to talk
                  to you about.

                                holden
                  money?

                                deckard
                  no.  i got a problem.

                                holden
                  let's hear it.

                                deckard
                  i think i'm starting to empathize
                  with these nexus-sixes.

        holden giggles.  starts to laugh again.  a blue light
        on the panel begins to turn very bright.  they both
        notice it.

                                deckard
                  what's that?

                                holden
                  i'm taking a piss.

        they wait for the light to abate.

                                holden
                  let me ask you something, deck.
                  you been having intimate relations
                  with one of these units?

        deckard doesn't deny it.  holden smiles like a cherub.

                                holden
                  that's what i thought... one of
                  the liabilities of the trade --
                  you has sex with your prey, old
                  buddy.  that's bound to create
                  problems, unless you're a black
                  widow.

        deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.

                                deckard
                  what about -- not sex -- but love?

        holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of
        his voice, but he can't.

                                holden
                  love is just another name for sex.
                  love is sexy and sex is lovely --
                  i don't care what you call it, an
                  android can't have it.

                                deckard
                  these aren't just...

                                holden
                  i know what they are, deck --
                  look, maybe they can pretend to
                  feel, but far as the raw, hot
                  emotions of the old heart -- no
                  way.

        holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.

                                holden
                  believe me, take it from an old
                  pro, no matter how good we get,
                  we're never gonna make an
                  artificial anything that can
                  feel.  it's a contradiction.
                  you might as well go fuck your
                  washing machine.

        holden laughs, deckard doesn't.

                                holden
                  just go out there and keep up
                  the good work.

        holden's whispers have become harder to hear.

                                holden
                  got to save it, deck, i'm getting
                  sleepy.  it's been good talking
                  to you.

        deckard stands.

                                deckard
                  thanks.

        but he's already asleep.  deckard stands there a moment
        looking at him, then walks out.
