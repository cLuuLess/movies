        speeding along the freeway.  the terminal in the com-
        munications console lit.  deckard's right hand just
        finished a punch-up.  the screen flashes back.

        deckard's voice has been heard over the preceding.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  machines can be helpful sometimes,
                  but they can also be a pain in the
                  ass.  ask for a trace on a forger
                  and you might wind up at a steel-
                  mill.  i don't mind a bum-steer once
                  in a while -- it's their personalities
                  that usually get me.  somebody once
                  said that man makes machines in his own
                  image.  if that's true, whoever made
                  esper should have been shot.

                                esper
                  this is esper and i'm ready.  go
                  ahead please.

        esper's deep melodious voice is anxious to please, and
        oiled with a touch of self-pity.

                                deckard
                  you equipped for random questions?

                                esper
                  why, yes, of course.

                                deckard
                  you start.

                                esper
                  the five in question are third
                  generation nexus sixes, constructed
                  of skin-flesh culture, selected
                  enogenic transfer conversion
                  capable of self-perpetuating
                  thought, para-physical abilities
                  and developed for emigration
                  program.  are you with me?

                                deckard
                  how do i stop one?

                                esper
                  unlike a five, they can sustain
                  massive traumas to several parts
                  of the body without debilitating
                  another.  sever a leg and it will
                  perform quicker on the remaining leg
                  than the fastest man can run,

                                deckard
                  okay, but...

                                esper
                  i'm coming to that.  vulnerable
                  zone is the base of the skull,
                  the occipital bone.  a direct hit
                  is a positive retirement.

        the communication is interrupted by a bell which is
        immediately followed by a stern, mechanical voice.

                                voice
                  you are in violation of traffic
                  ordinance m-139 statutory freeway
                  limit restricted by one-hundred
                  and eighty kilometers.

        in his rear view mirror deckard sees two black-clad
        motorcycle cops coming up behind him like the hounds
        of hell.  they draw silently alongside.  deckard
        presses his i.d. to the window.

        the cop tosses a salute to deckard and he and his
        partner accelerate, vanish in the night.  and deckard's
        car does too.
