        int. sebastian's apartment - day                        76

        he turns to close door, comes face to face with roy
        batty.  sebastian drops his bowl of eggs.  batty's
        hand flashes out and catches it.

                                batty
                  whoops.

        smiling, batty hands them back to sebastian, who is
        too startled to speak.

        pris runs up and gives batty and mary a big hug, steps
        back effusing and smiling, everybody's favorite teen-
        ager.

                                pris
                  this is my uncle roy, sebastian.

                                batty
                  hello, glad to meet you.

        he pumps sebastian's free hand.

                                pris
                  and my aunt mary.

        sebastian turns and there's aunt mary, modest and warm.

                                pris
                  and this is my savior, j.f. sebastian,
                  everybody.

        sebastian stands there with his eggs, bashful and ex-
        cited, the hero of this little family's warm attention.

                                batty
                  can't thank you enough, mr. sebastian.
                  if you hadn't come along...

                                mary
                  we were worried to death.  it's
                  awfully kind of you.

        sebastian is nodding and smiling.

                                batty
                  we're not used to the big city.
                  where we come from it's not so
                  easy to get lost.

                                mary
                  you certainly have a nice place
                  here.

                                batty
                  well stocked.

        batty looks around admiringly.  sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "thank you."

                                pris
                  sebastian doesn't like to go out
                  too much.

                                sebastian
                  i keep a lot of provisions right
                  here.

                                batty
                  i like a man who stays put.  an
                  admirable thing to be able to
                  sustain yourself in these times.
                  you live here all by yourself, do
                  you?

                                sebastian
                  well, no, not really.  there's
                  mr. deetchum, he's the watchman,
                  he lives on the first floor.

        everybody nods.  a long pause.

                                mary
                  we haven't found it easy, mr.
                  sebastian.

        they glance around the room, waiting for sebastian to
        pick up the ball.

                                sebastian
                  how about breakfast, i was just
                  going to make some.

                                batty
                  if it wouldn't be too much of a
                  bother... a little bite to eat
                  would be...

                                sebastian
                  oh, no bother, i'd be glad to.

                                batty
                  well, actually

                                mary
                  we're famished.

        sebastian is truly happy.

                                sebastian
                  okay, then.  you make yourselves
                  comfortable and i'll bring the
                  food right out.

        he disappears into the kitchen.  batty looks happy with
        the way things are going.

                                batty
                  charming.

        pris comes up close.  her tone muted but demanding.

                                pris
                  well?

        batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even
        more pugnacious.

                                pris
                  i want to know what's going on.

        there's a punitive edge to batty's response.

                                batty
                  there's only three of us left.

        pris is shocked.  her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                pris
                  then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                batty
                  not if everybody is doing their
                  job here at home.  how are things
                  at home?

        a little spotted pig on the table sits up.

                                pig
                  home again, jiggidy jig.

        they all turn and stare at the pig.  batty is delighted.

                                pris
                  i don't trust him.  i don't think
                  he knows what he's doing.

        the bell-tone from the microwave goes off in the kitchen.

                                batty
                  he knows what he's doing.

                                mary
                  if he won't cooperate?

                                batty
                  mr. sebastian is a host who wants
                  to be appreciated.  we'll
                  appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
