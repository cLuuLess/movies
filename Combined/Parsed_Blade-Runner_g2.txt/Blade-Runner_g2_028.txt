        int. deckard's apartment - night                        29

        it's dark except for the glow of the terminal.  a tired
        deckard sits in front of it.  esper sounds like he's
        been talking for hours.

                                esper
                  nexus designated leon:  incept
                  date april 10th, 2015 -- to be
                  used in military experiments to
                  determine how hyper metabolism
                  functions in deep space.

                  model, level of self-sufficiency,
                  optimum.

        a long pause.

                                esper
                  here's something you might find
                  interesting.  they have been built
                  to emulate the human in every way
                  except in its emotional spectrum.
                  however, after a period of time
                  it is only logical that such a
                  'mechanism' would create its own
                  emotional responses, hate, love,
                  fear, anger, envy.

                                deckard
                  i know all that.

                                esper
                  what about a summary then.

                                deckard
                  i think we're through for the night.

        deckard starts to reach for the panel.

                                esper
                  mr. deckard.

        hesitates.

                                deckard
                  yes?

                                esper
                  do you have something against
                  science?

                                deckard
                  not if it works.

                                esper
                  and what in your estimation works?

                                deckard
                  the umbrella.

        deckard picks up the umbrella and with it stabs the
        terminal off button before esper can respond and the
        machine goes dead.  he sits there for a moment then
        flips on the lamp.  leon's snap-shots are spread out
        before him.
