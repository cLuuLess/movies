        ext. lake - day                                         41

        cold and gray.  the current running strong.  the nose
        of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling
        for the shore.

        this is cold remote country, wild and untouched.  a sky
        bluer than the madonna's cloak.  the kayak banks and
        the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach
        towards a little camp.

                                voice
                  we're going to have to start the
                  sequence again if you don't stay
                  with me, deckard.  concentrate.

                                deckard's voice
                  how do you know i'm not?

                                voice
                  you're not responding to the
                  stimulus.  i can see right here,
                  i'm not getting a reading.

                                deckard's voice
                  i'm tired of this.

                                voice
                  almost through.
