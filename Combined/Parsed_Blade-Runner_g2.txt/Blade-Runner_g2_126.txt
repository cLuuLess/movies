        ext. woods - day                                        124

        deckard walking over the snow.  alone.  he walks slowly,
        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  his
        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears
        running down his pale cheeks.

        but for the squeak of his wet shoes over the crusted
        snow, there is no sound.  and deckard recedes into the
        silence of the freezing white landscape.
