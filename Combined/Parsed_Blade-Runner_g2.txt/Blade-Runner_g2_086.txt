        ext. tyrell preserve - dusk                             86

        on a gravel path between shrubs of winter roses, tyrell
        turns to observe the last quiet light over his kingdom.
        the moment is sweetened by the low plaintive bellow of
        one of the animals.

        he strolls by an old gardener who tips his cap, pro-
        ceeds up the steps and into his mansion.
