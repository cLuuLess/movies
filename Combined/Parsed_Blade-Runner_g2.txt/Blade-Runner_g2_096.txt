        ext. sebastian's apartment - night                      95

        in the dim, nocturnal light, deckard crosses into the
        courtyard fronting the building and stops.  he looks
        around.  nobody there, just silence.

        he comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-
        dows off to one side of the entry.

        his head jerks up to the sound of crashing glass.

        sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the
        pavement thirty feet below.

        deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-
        tered window on the next-to-top floor.
