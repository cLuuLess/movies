        int. deckard's apartment - living room - morning        73

        deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on
        his knees, the card with rachael's number in his lap
        and having no luck.

                                rachael's voice
                  sorry, i am not in at the moment,
                  but if you'll leave your name and
                  number i'll return your call as
                  soon as i can.

        that's not soon enough.  deckard hangs up, puts the
        phone on the floor and leans back on the couch.

                                deckard
                  fuck you, then.
