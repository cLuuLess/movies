        the eye                                                 2

        it's magnified and deeply revealed.  flecks of green
        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  icy filaments
        surround the undulating center.

        the eye is brown in a tiny screen.  on the metallic
        surface below, the words voight-kampff are finely
        etched.  there's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuations of the iris.

        the instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  the man talking is big,
        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  "leon" it says on
        his breast pocket.  he's dressed in a warehouseman's
        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
        his lap.  despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        the man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
        in gray.  detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  his name is holden and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        the room is large and humid.  rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  two large fans
        whir above their heads.

                                leon
                  okay if i talk?

        holden doesn't answer.  he's centering leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                leon
                  i kinda get nervous when i
                  take tests.

                                holden
                  don't move.

                                leon
                  sorry.

        he tries not to move but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                leon
                  already had i.q. test this year --
                  but i don't think i never had a...

                                holden
                         (cutting in)
                  reaction time is a factor in this,
                  so please pay attention.  answer
                  quickly as you can.

        leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
        holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
        response.

                                holden
                  you're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you look down and see a...

                                leon
                  what one?

        it was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                holden
                  what?

                                leon
                  what desert?

                                holden
                  doesn't make any difference what
                  desert -- it's completely
                  hypothetical.

                                leon
                  but how come i'd be there?

                                holden
                  maybe you're fed up, maybe you
                  want to be by yourself -- who
                  knows.  so you look down and
                  see a tortoise.  it's crawling
                  towards you...

                                leon
                  a tortoise.  what's that?

                                holden
                  know what a turtle is?

                                leon
                  of course.

                                holden
                  same thing.

                                leon
                  i never seen a turtle.

        he sees holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                leon
                  but i understand what you mean.

                                holden
                  you reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, leon.

        keeping an eye on his subject, holden notes the dials
        in the voight-kampff.  one of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                leon
                  you make these questions, mr.
                  holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        disregarding the question, holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                holden
                  the tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  but it can't.  not
                  without your help.  but you're
                  not helping.

        leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                leon
                  whatcha mean, i'm not helping?

                                holden
                  i mean you're not helping!
                  why is that, leon?

        leon looks shocked, surprised.  but the needles in
        the computer barely move.  holden goes for the inside
        of his coat.  but big leon is faster.  his laser burns
        a hole the size of a nickel through holden's stomach.
        unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  it goes
        through holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
        as a whistle.  like a rag doll he falls back off the
        bench from the waist up.  by the time he hits the
        floor, big slow leon is already walking away.  but he
        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
        fires at the machine on the table.

        there's a flash and a puff of smoke.  the voight-kampff
        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
        leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
        to blink, faint but steady.
