        int. old opera house - bar - night                      68

        cheap whiskey and bad wine.  that's the kind of place
        this is.  it's near closing.  but still a few at the
        bar.  alcoholic silhouettes.

        in the b.g. deckard comes down the passage from the
        men's room and stops at the phone.  he gets a number
        out of his pocket and calls it.  as he talks he leans
        against the wall, his body language intimate and chummy.

        not much action at the bar other than somebody snoring
        and a dipso down at the end having a conversation with
        himself.

        deckard hangs up, walks to the bar and straggles a
        stool.  the bartender's a big lady with tits like sand
        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.

                                bartender
                  i can't protect your drinks,
                  mister; while you was in the
                  potty, this hummer snatched it.

        deckard glances at his stool-mate.  a huge man, slumped
        over the bar like a beached whale.

                                deckard
                  no problem.  gimme another.

        the whale doesn't move, but it speaks, with a gravelly
        russian accent.

                                russian
                  forgive me.  i thought was free
                  drink.  i will pay.

                                deckard
                  forget it.

        but the big man's digging through his pockets.  deck-
        ard's drink arrives and the russian raises his head.
        it's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in
        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your
        heart.  but it's leon.

                                leon
                  i think i have no money.

                                deckard
                  it's okay.  forget it.

                                leon
                  but i would like to buy you drink.

                                deckard
                  i'll but you one.  what'll you
                  have?

                                leon
                  vodka!

                                deckard
                  shot of vodka, please.

                                leon
                  thank you very much.

                                deckard
                  my pleasure.

        deckard brings out his smokes.  offers one.  leon takes
        it and they light up.  the drinks come.

                                leon
                  prosit.

                                deckard
                  prosit.

        down the hatch.  leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-
        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and
        slaps that down too.  it's done with such pride that
        deckard has to look.

                                leon
                  you want to see my friends?

                                deckard
                  sorry, don't have the time.

                                leon
                  no problem.

        leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the
        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.

                                deckard
                  those cockroaches?

                                leon
                  ya.

        deckard looks interested.  one of them starts to scamp-
        er away, but leon walls off the next with his huge hand.

                                deckard
                  how long you had these guys?

                                leon
                  two months.  but this one is not
                  guy.  it is girl.  his girl.

        leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches
        to hear.

                                leon
                  usually blackie waits until igor
                  is eating; then, when his back is
                  turned, he tries to take advantage
                  of anna.

        deckard nods, definitely interested.  he signals the
        bartender for another round.  the drinks arrive.

                                leon
                  prosit.

                                deckard
                  prosit.

        down the hatch.  their eyes meet at the bottom.

                                leon
                  you never saw a cockroach make
                  love?

        deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to.

        leon smiles slyly.

                                leon
                  we will try.

        leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts
        it on the bar.  they both lean down and watch intently.
        the drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches
        are not cooperating.

                                leon
                  it must be that he is not hungry
                  or maybe she is not hot.

        leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them
        back in their box.  he holds up the last and kisses it.

                                leon
                  you like to kiss her goodbye.

                                deckard
                  no thanks.

                                bartender
                  make sure you take your girlfriends
                  with you when you leave.

        what neither of them notices is that between leon's
        fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh.

        deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.

                                leon
                  i like you.

                                deckard
                  i like you too.

                                leon
                  one more, eh?

                                deckard
                  i gotta piss.

        deckard gets on his feet, leans forward like a man in
        a stiff wind and stops.

                                deckard
                  i think i'll piss outside.

        leon watches his walk a perfect straight line through
        the bar down the passage and out of the rear exit.
