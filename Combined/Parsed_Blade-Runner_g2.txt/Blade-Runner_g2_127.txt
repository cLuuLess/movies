        ext. highway - night                                    125

        deckard's car, solid, throbbing, gunning along like
        some metal animal.  headlights piercing the dark of the
        long, flat road.  whistling speed of air and tires spin-
        ning thrum.  and then silence.  and the silence
        astounded by the crack of a gun.
