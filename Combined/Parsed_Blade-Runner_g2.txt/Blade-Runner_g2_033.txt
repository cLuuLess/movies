                  it seems your department doesn't
                  believe out new unit is to the
                  public benefit.

                                 deckard
                  a humanoid robot is like any other
                  machine, it can be a benefit or a
                  hazard.  if it's a benefit, it's
                  not our problem.

                                 rachael
                  but because your department can't
                  do an adequate job in detecting
                  the miniscule number at large,
                  it's a problem.  correct, mr.
                  deckard?
