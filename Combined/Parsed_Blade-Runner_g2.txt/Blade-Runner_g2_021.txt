        int. hannibal chew's shop - night                       22

        chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled
        eyes are shrewd and chinese, but the rest of him
        looks like a charles dickens invention.

        he's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched
        over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand.  after
        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
        smile.

                                chew
                  well, you're right.  this little
                  honey has a couple of defective cones.

        he snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his
        client.

        sebastian's face is almost young, but something has
        gone too far, too fast.  premature old age has made
        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  the
        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  se-
        bastian is a closet genius.

                                chew
                  you're a regular perfectionist,
                  sebastian.

        sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic
        mr. chew.

                                sebastian
                  it's gotta be right for my
                  customer.

                                chew
                  your customer, eh?

        chew snickers and beckons.  sebastian follows his down
        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  there's
        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  chew
        tugs it on and they go through.  the big door slams
        shut behind them.
