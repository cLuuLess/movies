        int. spinner - day                                      30

        a police marked spinner makes a sharp bank, drops into
        a steep curve and slides towards the tyrell corporation.

                  every government that could was
                  racing to populate their colonial
                  territory.  but emigrants needed
                  incentive.  over-population and
                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem
                  to be enough; but owning a human
                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.
                  it was big industry, the competition
                  was stiff and tyrell was top of the
                  line.
