        int. deckard's apartment - bathroom - night             70

        he's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast,
        water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking
        just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  i knew a cop once who was involved
                  in a high-speed chase.  they shot
                  out one of his tires and he went
                  over a cliff at hundred and fifty
                  miles an hour.  they found him in
                  the morning with a broken skull,
                  six fractured ribs and second-
                  degree burns.  on the way to the
                  hospital he made a play for the
                  nurse.

        he takes a drink and clears his throat.

                                deckard
                  hey!  i thought you were supposed
                  to be taking care of me.

                                rachael's voice
                  what do you need?

        he doesn't answer.  lies there sipping his drink.
        rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll,
        and stands there looking down at him.

                                deckard
                  don't just stand there looking at
                  me.  it's not polite.

                                rachael
                  what do you want me to do?

                                deckard
                  sit.

        she sits on the edge of the tub.

                                deckard
                  gimme your arm.

        she's wearing a short-sleeved dress.  it's a long, del-
        icate arm and deckard holds it, inspecting it like a
        maestro with a stradivarius.  he looks up at her.

                                deckard
                  you ever take a bath with a man
                  before?

                                rachael
                  there's a lot i haven't done with
                  a man before.

        he's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap
        her arm.  starting with her wrist and running the bar
        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  she
        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.

        he pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-
        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under
        her arm into the privacy of her dress.

                                rachael
                  you're getting me wet.

        oh, yes.  for a moment deckard stares at her like some
        furry-legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other
        hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.
