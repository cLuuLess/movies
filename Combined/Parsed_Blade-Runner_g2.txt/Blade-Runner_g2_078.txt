        int. deckard's apartment - day                          78

        he's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative.
        there's a sound.  his eyes move to the door.  those
        locks are opening again.  rachael comes in.  looks
        surprised to see him.  him too.

                                rachael
                  i told you i'd come back.

                                deckard
                  you did?

                                rachael
                  you didn't hear me.  you were
                  sleeping.

        he likes that.

                                rachael
                  are you glad i'm here?

        he is.  she's spunky.  hasn't seen this place in the
        daytime.  pleased, he watched her move around the mess.
        she spots a little framed photograph.  picks it up.
        it's a man with a shotgun and a boy holding up a quail.

                                rachael
                  who is this?

                                deckard
                  me and my dad.

                                rachael
                  where is he?

                                deckard
                  dead.

                                rachael
                  oh.

        she puts it down and comes to him.

                                rachael
                  how come you're not on the job?

                                deckard
                  i am.  part of my job is to sit
                  on a couch and try and figure
                  things out.

                                rachael
                  how are you doing?

                                deckard
                  not too good.

        she sits next to him.

        pleased as hell, they both sit there staring straight
        ahead.  he looks at her.  she looks at him.

                                rachael
                  what do people do in the afternoon?

                                deckard
                  if they are smart, they take
                  naps.
