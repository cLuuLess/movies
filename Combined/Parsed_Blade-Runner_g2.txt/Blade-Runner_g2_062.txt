        int. the old opera house - night                        62

        onstage four mexican acrobats, in matching metallic
        jumpsuits roll head over heels in their rendition of
        a human wheel.  from the p.a. system the announcer's
        voice blares through the cavernous theatre.

                                announcer's voice
                  let's hear it for the hermano
                  brothers.

        scattered applause.  hand in hand, the hermano brothers
        bow deeply, spring up and trot offstage.

                                announcer's voice
                  next we're gonna see a little
                  charmer who keeps her dancing
                  partner in a basket!  she
                  comes to us all the way from
                  exotic casablanca.  'salome.'

        the old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version
        of "in a persian market" as salome dances onstage.
        she's a black-haired beauty in a scant belly dancer
        costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in
        the right places.  she kneels ceremoniously center
        stage and sets the basket down before her.  carefully
        removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four-
        foot harlequin-patterned python.  grinding her hips
        to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out
        like an offering.  sounds of approval from the audience.
        the gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer,
        as she weaves sensuously around the floor.
