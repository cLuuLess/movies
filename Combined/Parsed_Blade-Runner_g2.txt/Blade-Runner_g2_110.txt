        int. tenth floor corridor - night                       108

        he drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his
        head into the wall again.

                                batty
                  think!  we need a little
                  resilience around here!

        he yanks him further and bashes his head again.

                                batty
                  where are those balls of yours?!
                  let's see a little bravery!

        the storm passes.

        deckard hangs in batty's hand like a bag of laundry.

                                batty
                  that was irrational of me -- not
                  to mention unsportsmanlike.  won't
                  happen again.

        he drops him.

                                batty
                  i'll be down the hall when you're
                  ready.

        betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors.

        deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo-
        ment, then punches it with his fist.

        on his feet he's a little wobbly.  holding his breath
        so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens.  no
        sound.  no sign of batty.  the laser is laying nearby.
        he doesn't bother.

        deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can.  he
        had a job to do.  he would like to have done it, but
        he's not insane.  he gets to the landing and turns.

        on the first step down, he stops.  batty's on the land-
        ing below, looking up at him.

                                batty
                  where you going?

        he wait a moment for deckard's answer.

                                batty
                  no cheating.  a promise is a
                  promise.  i'll honor the
                  handicapped, but we gotta play on
                  the top floor.  you go get your
                  laser gun now.  and i'll give you
                  a few seconds before i come.

        deckard turns back into the hall.  batty smiles.

        deckard's running down the corridor.

                                batty's voice
                  one!

        halfway down the hall he finds his laser.

                                batty's voice
                  two!

        deckard darts into the nearest door.  the apartment
        above sebastian's, with the hole in the floor.  deckard
        considers it.

                                batty's voice
                  no fair jumping through holes.  you
                  might get hurt doing that!  three!

        deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door
        and goes in.
