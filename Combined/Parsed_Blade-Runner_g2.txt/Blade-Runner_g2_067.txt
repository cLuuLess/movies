        int. old opera house - men's room - night               67

        your standard low class crapper.  bryant is planted
        firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals
        rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his
        anger.  this is a public place, he doesn't want to
        yell.

                                bryant
                  just because it's a nexus 6 doesn't
                  change procedure.  a little known
                  fact can become a well-known fact
                  and part of our job, deckard, is
                  to make sure that doesn't happen.
                  now how can be do that if you blow
                  one away in front of a fuckin'
                  audience.

        it's not the sort of question that expects an answer.
        deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll
        all go away.

                                bryant
                  well?

        deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel.
        bryant slaps one in his hand.

                                deckard
                  she was gonna get away.

                                bryant
                  then let her get away.  i thought
                  you were a pro -- you're supposed
                  to be a fuckin' tracker!

        bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.

                                bryant
                  i'd say you got a little carried
                  away.

        deckard's voice is barely audible.

                                deckard
                  i didn't like her.

                                bryant
                  you didn't like her!?

        he slams the handle on one of the urinals.

                                bryant
                  you start liking or disliking
                  andies it's time to hang it up.

        the plumping roars and sucks and dies.  there's nothing
        to do but nod.  deckard nods.  poor bastard has had a
        rough night.  bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and
        hands it to him.  deckard puts it to his mouth and
        bryant watches deckard's adam's apple like he's count-
        ing the swallows.  deckard hands it back empty.  bryant
        caps it, puts it back in his pocket.

                                bryant
                  look, go home.  get some rest.
                  take an aspirin.

                                deckard
                  yeah.

        bryant shuffles out like an old bear.
