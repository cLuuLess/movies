        deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath -- talk
        about a hair trigger... silence.  batty's feet are heard
        creaking away.  deckard looks around.  runs a hand over
        the wall behind him.  batty's feet come back.  a pause.

                                batty
                  ten!

        the door explodes!

        a shape hurtles across the room.  deckard pivots, fol-
        lowing it with rapid fire.  it's a tv.  he spins back.
        but batty's already on him.  he gets one shot off be-
        fore batty's got his hand.  there's a hole over batty's
        right eye.  blood running down his face, dripping on
        deckard.  the right side of his face isn't working too
        good.  the corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut --
        his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.

                                batty
                  one point for you.

        the would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes
        it more malignant.  he throws deckard against the far
        wall.  deckard fires.  hits batty in the shoulder.

                                batty
                  ho ho!  try it again!

        he comes at deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in
        fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement
        as deckard tries to get a shot, firing away until his
        laser's empty.  bloody and crazed, batty pushes up
        against him.

                                batty
                  what's wrong?  don't you like me?
                  i'm what we've made!
