        int. leon's room - night                                15

        an empty room.  a cot and not much else.  he steps in
        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  for a
        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
        clean.  spartan in fact.  the towel by the spotless
        basin is perfectly folded.

        deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  no dust.  he
        looks in the waste basket.  wadded up candy wrappers.
        the bed by the window is neatly made.  deckard looks
        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
        mattress.

        the closet.  there's one suit in it.  he pats it down.
        nothing. a show box on the floor.  he stoops, takes
        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
        fully traces it over the box.  assured of its harm-
        lessness, he lifts off the lid.

        it contains a little stack of photos bound with a
        rubber band.  deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
        by the balcony window and turns it on.

        a touching collection of family snapshots.  the kind of
        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
        the family dog.  junior on the pony squinting in the
        sun.  uncle ben clowning with the kids.  the faded
        polaroid of christmas morning.  simple pictures of
        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  a curious
        collection for the likes of leon and deckard studies
        them with interest.
