        int. dining room - night                                91

        the birthday cake has arrived, the candles lit.  they're
        waiting for dad.  mrs. tyrell looks around to find batty
        observing from the doorway.

        a little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-
        porate wife, she smiles.

                                mrs. tyrell
                  may i help you?

        batty smiles back and shakes his head in mock regrets.
