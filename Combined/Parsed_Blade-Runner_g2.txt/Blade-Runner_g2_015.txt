        ext. street below - night                               16

        oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands
        in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
        looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
        day.

        leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
        watching deckard at the window.  he's still wearing
        his coveralls, but he looks different.  his face is
        more intent, smarter and angry.
