        ext. alley - old opera house - night                    69

        deckard reels out.  the door swings shut and he's sober
        as hell and moving fast.  around the big trash dumpster
        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the
        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  he's in a
        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  moments go by
        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  the
        sound of his breathing, the hum of the city and the
        quiet.

        suddenly from behind, deckard is swept off his feet and
        twirled around in leon's bear-trap embrace.

        leon lets go and deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls
        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but leon is so
        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.

        leon moves towards him, backing deckard against the wall.

                                leon
                  how come you know where zhora was
                  so quick?

        his hand is lightning.  it shoots out, grabs deckard's
        hair.

                                deckard
                  i showed pictures.  somebody
                  recognized her.  i went to see.

        deckard is pale.  the sweat is starting to run.

                                leon
                  how old am i?

                                deckard
                  i don't know.

        the grip tightens and twists.

                                leon
                  my birthday is april 10, 2015.
                  how long do i live?

                                deckard
                  four years.

        he lets go.

                                leon
                  more than you.

        deckard's knees come up fast.  leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                leon
                  painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                leon
                  but that's how it is to be a
                  slave.  the future is sealed off,
                  he grovels, he waits.

        even hurt, deckard is fast.  he goes for his ankle gun,
        but leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                leon
                  sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  but no way to
                  satisfy them.  to be homesick
                  with no place to go.  potential
                  with no way to use it.  lots of
                  little oversights in the nexus 6.

        he slams deckard into the wall.

                                leon
                  i tell you, nothing is worse
                  than having an itch you can never
                  scratch.

        deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next
        one.

        leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing deckard's skull.

        the spasm that runs through leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  it's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  he hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  dead.

        rachael is standing in the alley.  deckard lies there
        looking at her.  she comes slowly and quietly forward
        and drops deckard's gun by his side.

        deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get
        up, but can't quite manage it.  he looks up at her,
        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.

                                deckard
                  like i said, i don't need your
                  help.

        after a long moment, she bends down to touch him.

                                rachael
                  you look terrible, you know that?
