        int. dressing room - night                              64

        musty and cramped.  a portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  salome takes the snake from around
        her shoulders and lays it on the dressing table.  deck-
        ard watches it undulate into the warmth of the lights.

                                deckard
                  it that mother real?

                                salome
                  of course he's not real.  you think
                  i'd be working here if i could
                  afford a real snake?

                                deckard
                  it's a good job.

                                salome
                  you mean the snake.

        deckard nods.  there's not much costume to take off but
        she's doing it.

                                salome
                  the best.

                                deckard
                  does it eat?

                                salome
                  come on.

        his hand reaches out to touch it.  as his fingers make
        contact there's an electric "snap."  he jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

                                salome
                  jeezus!

                                deckard
                  sorry.

                                salome
                  hey!  do your job but don't wreck
                  mine, huh?

        she slides behind the screen and turns on the shower.
        deckard starts creeping around pacing around the room
        like he's inspecting the walls.

                                deckard
                  they have their ways of doing
                  their dirty work without the
                  victim knowing what's going on.

        his eyes are moving over everything she's got.

                                deckard
                  you'd be surprised what a guy'll
                  go through to get a glimpse of a
                  beautiful body.

                                salome
                  i bet i would.

                                deckard
                  little dirty holes the bastards
                  drill in the wall so they can
                  watch a lady undress.

        and to his amazement he actually spots one.  it's down
        low on the wall.  not a good idea to turn his back on
        work but he can't resist.

                                salome
                  and what if somebody did try to
                  'exploit' me?  who do i go to?

        through the hole deckard is looking at a pair of fat
        legs.

                                deckard
                  me.

                                salome
                  and who do i go to about you?

        he looks back.  she's some out of the shower dripping
        nude.  she's taken off her black wig.  her hair is
        short and blonde.

        deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit.
        he stares at her a moment too long.

                                deckard
                  hmmmmm?

        deckard grins and she returns it.

        she takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her
        body.  the snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue
        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  absently,
        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.

                                zhora
                  you ever get the feeling things
                  aren't the way they seem?

        her hand closes around the snake's head.  deckard sees
        it coming but can't move fast enough.  she strikes him
        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  before he hits the
        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  the snake whistles
        through the air again as deckard rolls out of the way.
        it slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.
        he goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.
