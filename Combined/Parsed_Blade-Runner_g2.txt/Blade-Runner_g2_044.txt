        int. sebastian's apartment - late afternoon             44

        the referee is bouncing around the ring, trying to keep
        up with the two mexican light-weights pounding the shit
        out of each other.  if not for the fuzz and the silence,
        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think
        you were ringside at the garden.  it's a good fight but
        pris isn't watching.

        she's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe
        nails.  the room is so quiet you can almost hear the
        polish.  she starts on her fourth toe when a noise
        form above stops her

        it sounded like a creaking of a floor, but so quiet,
        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  she
        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at
        sebastian.

        on the other side of the room, in his own world,
        sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering
        gossamer strands with a laser.

        pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door
        quietly behind her.  if the animoids nestled around
        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd
        be the only ones in the room who did.
