        deckard walks up to a desk, hands his i.d. to a guard
        who checks it against a list on a screen.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  but so far they'd always managed
                  to keep it quiet.  not to say
                  that once in a while there wasn't
                  bad publicity.  some fanatic
                  bitching about equal rights for
                  andies or an occasional trade union
                  proclaiming it was aun-american for
                  automatons to take jobs away from
                  humans on the colony.

        the guard hands deckard back his i.d., pushed a button
        and deckard walks away.

                                deckard (v.o.)
                  but what's more american than good
                  old supply and demand?  the
                  government needed them, industry
                  made them and the church backed
                  them.  the big religious boys
                  said that androids, no matter how
                  human, were objects; only god
                  could make people. i'm not religious,
                  but i was inclined to agree.
                  otherwise i'd be out of a job.

        the elevator door slides open.  the young lady inside
        would look right standing on a cliff, hair blowing in
        the wind, looking out to sea in a 19th century painting.

                                rachael
                  hello, mr. deckard.  my name is
                  rachael.

        deckard tips his head to her and steps in.
