39	int.  president's  office

	the manuscript is open on the president's desk.. close on:
	billy's rendering of the mondoshawan.

						cornelius
					(to the president)
				the mondoshawans don't belong to the
				federated territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				these elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				the supreme being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	the supreme being is standing, as if frozen in armor.  all we see is the
bottom half of his body.  big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four sacred stones.

						cornelius
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat evil.

	the president points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						president
				but what happens if instead of
				this... ultimate warrior... it is evil
				who stands here?

						cornelius
				white turns to black.  light to dark.
				life to death.  for all eternity.

	the president's nerves quiver.

						captain
				sir, we have a mondoshawan spaceship at
				the frontier requesting permission to enter
				 our territory.

						president
				i guess i should make a decision..

						cornelius
				they are the only ones who can help..

						general
				sir..the mondoshawan do not belong to the
				federation. we do not know their intention..
				i must recommend a full trinuclear assault..

						president
					(yells)

				like a gum drop?  you can't even tell me what it is!
				i ask you for options you give me bullshit.
				give them permission to enter our territories
				with my warmest regards.

						cornelius
					(relieved)
