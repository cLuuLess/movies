	cornelius and loc rhod are bent over the buttons looking for a way to
release the lines.

						voice (o.s.)
				6... 5...

						korben
				found it?

	loc rhod searches frantically.

						loc rhod
				i don't even know what i'm looking for!

						korben
				fuck it! hold tight!

	korben slams the throttle into full forward.  the ship roars away ripping
the lines to shreds.

	loc rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.

	cut to:

	the counter goes 1... 0

	-the suite disintegrates - the corridor is consumed.

	-the main hall is no more.
