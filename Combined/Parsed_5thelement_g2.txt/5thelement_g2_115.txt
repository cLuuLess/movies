116	int.  korben's  apartment

	korben opens the shower door.  leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						korben
				i'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

his eyes fall on an old blanket.

						korben
				here let me wrap you up.

	korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						korben
			..it's funny.  i've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	she recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						leeloo
					(nicely)
				valo massa... chacha hamas.

						korben
				uh..you're welcome.

	the intimacy makes him nervous.  he looks for a diversion.

						korben
				coffee!  that's what you need!
				a nice, hot cup of coffee!

	he pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						korben
				with some honey!  you'll see, honey's
				great!...

	korben rummages through the drawer.  leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						korben
				a hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	he rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  she opens a drawer and comes upon..

						korben
					(nervously)
				i've got this great honey somewhere.
				you know about honey?  there used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of major korben dallas war hero.

						korben
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	she looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						korben
				i forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	and she smiles.

						korben
				here it is!

	korben holds up the jar of honey.

						korben
				taste this...

	leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						korben
				it... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	she savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  her lips shine with honey.  her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  he begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	an indistinct sound comes from the wall.  but korben is so entranced with
the sight of leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						korben
				you hear that?

						leeloo
					(licking)
				cornelius..

						korben
				oh god!

	korben pushes the button on the wall.  the bed pops out, fully made, with
cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						korben
				i'm really sorry.. let me help you..

korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						leeloo
				achta ge lumitai de matala..

	korben turns..

						korben
				what?

	he turns to leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. his breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  korben drops to
the floor.

						leeloo
					(displeased)
				vano da, mechteba?!
				soun domo kala chon hammas!

						cornelius
				no, i'm not proud of myself...
				but we don't have the luxury of choice.
