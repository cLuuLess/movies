62	int.  cornelius'  apartment - day

	in his armchair, cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						cornelius
					(with a start)
				who are you?

						korben
				i brought the girl remember?

						cornelius
				the girl?

	cornalius gets up.  he looks at the handle.

						korben
				yeah! she dropped in on me. i mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	and then it dawns on cornelius who the girl is.

						cornelius
					(eyes riveted on her)
				he's a she!

						korben
					(bemused)
				you noticed...

						cornelius
					(face shining)
				there's not a moment to lose! wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  this woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! she is... perfect!

						korben
				so you do know her.

						cornelius
				uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	cornelius runs into the next room.  korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	her beauty troubles him.  he hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						korben
				perfect...
