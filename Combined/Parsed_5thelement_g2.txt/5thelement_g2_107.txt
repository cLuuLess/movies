						munro
				i managed to contact the mondoshawan.
				they deplore the incident, but accept our
				apologies.

						president
					(relieved)
				and the stones?  did you find them in the
				wreckage?

						munro
				the-stones weren't aboard the ship.

						president
					(surprised)
				...what do you mean?

	the president is all ears.

	so is zorg's right arm.

						munro
				the mondoshawan never fully trusted the
				human race..they felt we're too unpredictable..
				so they gave up the stones to somebody they
				do trust. her name is plavalaguna. she's a diva
				and she's going to sing at the charity ball on
				fhloston paradise in a few hours.  she has the
				stones with her.

	the president breathes easier.

	zorg's right arm is delighted.

						president
					(taking off a shoe)
				excellent!

	the president crushes the cockroach with his shoe.

	right arm's earphones fly off his head. good-bye eardrums.
