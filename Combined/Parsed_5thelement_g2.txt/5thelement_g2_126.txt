plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

				disinfecting!

	two disinfectors in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  they go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  the flame
burns everything it touches.  a pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  a small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.
