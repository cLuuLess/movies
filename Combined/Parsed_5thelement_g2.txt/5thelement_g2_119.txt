120	int. airport  hall - day

	cornelius and leeloo (still damp) arrive at the manhattan intergalactic
airport.
	a huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	there are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  a security guard picks up a phone off the wall.

				illegal gathering in zone 4.

	a hand taps leeloo from behind.  she whips around catching david in the
face.

						cornelius
				leeloo, be careful.

	he turns to david who in holding his bloody nose.

						cornelius

	david hands cornelius two passports.

						cornelius

	he hands it to her.  the name makes her smile.

						cornelius

	she frowns.

						leeloo

						cornelius

				david's in great shape.

	she looks at david holding his bloody nose.

						cornelius
				he'll protect you. go on... see the diva...
				get the stones... see you at the temple...
				god be with you.

	angle on: korben comes rushing into the airport. walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for leeloo. a police patrol bearing down on the
strikers jostles him. the cops open fire.  the strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.
