70	int.  cornelius'  apartment - day

	... and david enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						cornelius
				there was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... asking all these questions about
				the sacred stones..at the time i didn't think
				anything of it.. what was his name? i'm so
				bad with names...

						david
					(to leeloo, timid)
				i didn't know your size.

	leeloo is happy. she pulls off the towel and stands there nude. cornelius
and david turn away.

						david
				they really made her...

						cornelius
				perfect.

	leeloo finishes dressing. she is delighted.

						leeloo
					(to david)
				domo danko!

	david smiles, dumb with admiration.  cornelius comes over.

						cornelius
				leeloo?  the stones...
				we must get them back.

	leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						leeloo
				ikset-kiba.  me imanetaba oum dalat!

						cornelius
				you know exactly where they are!
