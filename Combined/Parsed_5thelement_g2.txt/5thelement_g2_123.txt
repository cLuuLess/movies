124	int.  airport

	the check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						check-in attendant
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...mr. dallas... korben dallas?

	zorg's right arm gives her a big smile.

						right arm
				that's right.

	the attendant scans the id with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						check-in attendant
				the problem is i only have one korben dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	right arm's smile shatters.

						right arm
				that's impossible!  he's in j... i mean, there
				must be some mistake. i have my ticket!
				i'm the real korben dallas!

	a shrill bell rings out.

						check-in attendant
					(smiling)
				i'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	the attendant hits a button.  a thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	right arm totally loses it.

						right arm
				i want to see your boss!  get rid of this
				fucking window! somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	he pounds on the counter with both fists. a steel curtain comes down.
red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						voice (o.s.)
				this is not an exercise.  this is a police
				control.
				put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						right arm
					(slowing down)
				sorry, my fault... just a little overexcited...
				that's all... i'm calm now.
