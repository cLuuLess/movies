83	int.  zorg's  office

	zorg turns to cornelius.

						zorg
				zorg. jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg...
				nice to see you again

						cornelius
				i remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						zorg
				i'm glad you got your memory back, father...
				because you're going to need it...
				where are the stones?

						cornelius
				...why on earth do the stones interest you?

						zorg
				personally, they are of no interest to me,
				i'd rather sell weapons..but i have a customer...
				so tell me...

						cornelius
				even it i did know where the stones were
				i would never tell somebody like you.

						zorg
				why?  what's wrong with me?

						cornelius
				...i'm a priest! i'm here to serve life,
				all you want to do is destroy it.

						zorg
				ah, father... you are so wrong.
				let me explain...

	zorg leads cornelius into his inner office.

						zorg
				...would you like a drink?

						cornelius
				no thank you.

						zorg
				follow me.. life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. look at this empty
				glass.

	zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						zorg
				here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	zorg pushes the glass off the table.  it shatters on the floor.

						zorg
				destroyed...

	small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						zorg
				...look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				notice how each one is useful.
				what a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  so full of..life!

						cornelius
				they are robots!

	a servant comes in pours water in another glass.  zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						zorg
				yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				i gave work to at least fifty people today. the
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	cornelius sits in silence.

						zorg
				father, by creating a little destruction,
				i am, in fact, encouraging life!  so, in
				reality, you and i are in the same business!

						cornelius
				destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						zorg
				let me reassure you father..i will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  unable to breathe, zorg starts
to panic.

						cornelius
					(mocking)
				where's the robot to pat your back?

	zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  they pop out all over the desk.
true chaos reigns.  even a cage appears, holding a souliman aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, picasso, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  he
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  zorg motions for help.

						cornelius
				can i give you a hand?

	cornelius whacks him on the back.  the cherry comes flying out.  zorg
regains control of himself. guards come running in.

						zorg
				you saved my life... so, i'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the guards)
				throw him out!

	the guards throw cornelius out.

						cornelius
				you are a monster, zorg!

						zorg
					(complimented)
				i know...

	the guards drag cornelius out of the office.

						zorg
				...torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but i want
				those stones. you have an hour.

	right arm salutes and hurries out of the office.
