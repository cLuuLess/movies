               int. the set. day

               the camera reveals nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. 
               she rises as nick and palomino reappear and approach her 
               from behind the set.

                                     nick
                         nicole, listen...

                                     nicole
                         nick, it's my fault the scene isn't 
                         working. i apologize. chad, i 
                         apologize to you too. i'm completely 
                         unfocused here and i think you're 
                         absolutely right; what we need to do 
                         is loosen the scene up somehow.

               nick and palomino stare at nicole for a moment.

                                     nick
                         what would you like to do?

                                     nicole
                         i was wondering if we could try 
                         improvising the scene. more along 
                         the lines of what chad has been doing. 
                         maybe that would help me find 
                         something.

               nick's smile of gratitude to nicole looks almost drug-induced.

                                     nick
                         that's a fantastic idea. what do you 
                         think, chad?

                                     palomino
                         hey, that's the only way i can work. 
                         let's take it apart, let's cut loose.

                                     nick
                         good! and we'll shoot it! hell, why 
                         not?!

                                     palomino
                         roll that motherfucking camera, 
                         wolfie!

                                     wolf
                         kiss my ass!

               although wolf says this quite loud, palomino doesn't hear 
               him because he suddenly yells:

                                     palomino
                         yeah! let's go!

                                     nick
                         alright, now we're making a fucking 
                         movie! call it, wanda!

                         roll sound.

                                     wanda

                                     clapper
                         scene six, take five!

                                     nick
                         and, action.
