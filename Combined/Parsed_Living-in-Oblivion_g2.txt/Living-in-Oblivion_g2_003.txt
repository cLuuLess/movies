               int. car. night. b/w

               nicole sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station 
               wagon. she glances out at the empty city moving past her 
               window and lets out a deep sigh.

               jeff, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into 
               the rearview mirror.

                                     jeff
                         tired?

                                     nicole
                         no, i've been up since four. i've 
                         got a big scene today and i'm kind 
                         of nervous.

                                     jeff
                         "ellen talks to mom."

                                     nicole
                         have you read the script?

                                     jeff
                         no. it's on the callsheet.

                                     nicole
                         oh. well, it's pretty emotional. i 
                         tell my mother i never felt she really 
                         loved me.

                                     jeff
                         you're going to yell at each other?

                                     nicole
                         i don't know. i'm just going to go 
                         with how i feel. which is the scary 
                         part. i'm very close to this 
                         character.

                                     jeff
                         problems with your own mom?

                                     nicole
                         yes. but she died before i, well 
                         before we could reconcile...

                                     jeff
                         you were great in that richard gere 
                         movie.

                                     nicole
                         thanks.
