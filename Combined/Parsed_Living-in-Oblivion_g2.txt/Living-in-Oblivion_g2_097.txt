               int. the set. the dream. day

               nicole takes the silent "action" cue from nick.

                                     nicole
                         i am so hungry.

               right on cue cora walks through the door, holding the golden 
               apple out in front of her. she circles nicole with 
               determination, seemingly oblivious to nick and the rest of 
               the crew hovering behind wolf as he begins following her 
               with the hand-held camera. wolf is now in his element; gliding 
               like nureyev with the camera. when he pans suddenly with 
               cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera 
               range.

               cora finally stops circling nicole and stops abruptly. 
               suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of nicole. 
               wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing cu 
               of the apple with nicole seen behind it. nicole reaches out, 
               grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.

               cu nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight.

               cora takes one step forward. cu her fuzzy slippers stopping 
               right on the yellow tape mark. cora waits momentarily until 
               wolf has reframed both her and nicole, then lets out a huge 
               laugh.
