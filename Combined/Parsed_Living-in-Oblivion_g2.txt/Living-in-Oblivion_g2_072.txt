               int. the set. near the camera

               wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the 
               bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops 
               in battle. nick approaches her.

                                     nick
                         how are we doing, wanda?

                                     wanda
                         not good, nick. not bad, but not 
                         good. we need to finish this scene 
                         and do scene thirty-one today.

                                     nick
                         scene thirty-one?! i left my notes 
                         for scene thirty-one at home! i didn't 
                         know we were --

                                     wanda
                         nick, nick. i'll send someone to 
                         your apartment to pick them up. now, 
                         relax.

                                     nick
                         oh, ok. send somebody to my apartment 
                         to pick them up; it's the red 
                         notebook, under the bed.

                                     wanda
                         it's taken care of, nick.

                                     nick
                         good. great. good.

               nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. a moment later 
               wolf strolls up to wanda.

                                     wolf
                         we're all lit, the smoke machine is 
                         under control; we're ready to go.

                                     wanda
                              (hard)
                         what about the dolly?

                                     wolf
                         just need to see a run-through and 
                         we're all set. i'm going to make 
                         your job easy today, wanda. wandaful.
                              (he slips his arm 
                              around her)
                         mmm, i'm glad you wore that perfume. 
                         and don't worry about palomino; i'll 
                         take you to a jazz club tonight.

                                     wanda
                         oh, i can't make it. i have to go 
                         see chad; he's extremely ill.

                                     wolf
                         oh, by the way my eye's much better.

                                     wanda
                         listen, wolf, this may not be the 
                         best time to say this but our 
                         relationship is going nowhere.

                                     wolf
                         what do you mean?

                                     wanda
                         please, don't take it personally. 
                         because i care for you, wolf, i really 
                         do. but i've had this feeling for 
                         quite a while and i think it's time 
                         we ended it. ok?

                                     wolf
                              (pause)
                         ok.

                                     wanda
                         i think it's better.

                                     wolf
                         so do i.

                                     wanda
                         well, good. still friends?

                                     wolf
                         sure.

                                     wanda
                         great, cause we still have to work 
                         together and there's no reason it 
                         has to be unpleasant. give me a hug.

               wanda and wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace.

                                     wanda
                         you're a real special guy, wolf.

                                     wolf
                         thanks.

               wanda slips wolf a tender smile then walks away.

                                     wanda
                              (into her walkie)
