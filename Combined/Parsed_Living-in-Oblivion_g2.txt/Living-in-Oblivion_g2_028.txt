               int. set apt. the couch. day. b/w

               nicole gets up quietly and sits next to cora on the couch, 
               wordlessly taking her hand in hers.

                                     cora
                              (whispers)
                         i'm so sorry. i'm fucking this up 
                         for you.

                                     nicole
                              (whispers)
                         cora, don't even think that. you're 
                         doing great. i'm the one who's fucking 
                         it up. if i get through this i swear 
                         i'm never acting again.

               she means it. cora glances up at her, seeing for the first 
               time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from nicole's 
               face. on an impulse cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand 
               of nicole's hair from her eyes.

               a sudden amazed alarm fills nicole. the living room grows 
               strangely quiet.

                                     nick
                              (faintly, from a 
                              distance)
                         and, action on the run-through.

               cu nicole. she looks quickly toward nick in confusion.
