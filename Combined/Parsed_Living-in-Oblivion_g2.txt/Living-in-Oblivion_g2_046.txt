               int. the scene. take two. day

                                     nicole
                         i've always admired you from afar.

               palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking 
               and causing the camera crew and nicole considerable confusion.

                                     palomino
                         admired? that sounds rather 
                         professional.

                                     nicole
                         well, then: loved. how does that 
                         sound?

                                     palomino
                         it sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     nicole
                         i've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     palomino
                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     nicole
                         we were working together. i didn't 
                         want anything to interfere.

                                     palomino
                         god. and all this time i thought...

               the scene once again is awful. nick gives their listless 
               kiss a few moments then calls cut.
