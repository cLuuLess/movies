               int. near the camera. day

               palomino tiptoes over to the camera where wanda and the 
               scriptgirl are standing side by side. as he leans between 
               them, checking his lines on the scriptgirl's script, he 
               inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.

                                     palomino
                              (whispers)
                         someone over here smells very, very 
                         nice.

               thinking he means her, wanda's lips flutter in a brief, 
               involuntary smile. meanwhile, the scriptgirl turns away, 
               blushing furiously.
