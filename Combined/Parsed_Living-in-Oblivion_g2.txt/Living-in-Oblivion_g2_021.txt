               int. apt. hallway. day. b/w

               nick, cora, and nicole stand in a corner of the landing. 
               nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood.

                                     nick
                         well, let's see. what do you think 
                         is going to happen next, cora?

                                     cora
                         i'm going to have a heart attack!

                                     nick
                         no, you're not. you're going in there 
                         in two minutes and we are really 
                         going to nail this scene. i know it. 
                         i have no doubt about it. nicole...

               nick turns to nicole and stops in midsentence. he looks at 
               her for a long moment. nicole returns his gaze then suddenly 
               looks away.

                                     wanda (v.o.)
                         nick! nick!

                                     nick
                         one second!

               nick hesitates a moment then rushes back to the set.

                                     cora
                         i'll tell you this much right now; i 
                         am never, ever doing another fucking 
                         low-budget movie.
