                         in closing i'd like to say to all 
                         the people who told me not to make 
                         this movie, who wouldn't meet with 
                         me or return a simple phone call. to 
                         my favorite professor at film school 
                         whose parting advice to me was to 
                         take a job teaching at a women's 
                         college. to delores delsporto, the 
                         girl i loved in high school who left 
                         me for a jr. varsity football player: 
                         to all these people i'd like to say 
                         thank you but i can't because what i 
                         really feel like saying is go fu --
