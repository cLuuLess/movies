               int. the set. day

               palomino saunters onto the set as wolf and his crew finish 
               relighting.

                                     palomino
                         yo, wolfman. is this my new mark?

                                     wolf
                         until you change it. where's my 
                         fucking eyepatch?!

               wolf walks off. the gaffer slips the ac a shrewd wink then 
               walks over and stands next to palomino, giving him a big, 
               friendly grin.

                                     gaffer
                         hey, chad.

                                     palomino
                         hey, whatya say.

                                     gaffer
                         i'm bob. i'm lighting this show.

                                     palomino
                         chad palomino; actor.

                                     gaffer
                              (big smile)
                         i know.

                                     palomino
                              (to the ac)
                         hey, what's your name?

                                     ac
                         maurice.

                                     palomino
                         maurice! hey, maurice chevalier! any 
                         relation? probably not. hey, smoking 
                         crew guys, really.

               the gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and 
               begins leafing through it.

                                     gaffer
                         hey thanks, chad. actually i wrote a 
                         script.

                                     palomino
                         oh, yeah?

               palomino takes the gaffer's script and holds it up to his 
               eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the 
               room. he points to the light.

                                     palomino
                         hey, bill. see that light over there?

                                     gaffer
                         uh, yeah.

                                     palomino
                         lower it about three feet.

               palomino hands the gaffer back his script and walks off. the 
               gaffer and ac stand in silence for a long awkward moment.
