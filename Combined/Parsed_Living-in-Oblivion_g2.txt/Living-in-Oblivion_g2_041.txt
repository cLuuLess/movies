               int. the set. morning

               a small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the 
               middle of the huge empty space. one wall has a fake window. 
               the gaffer lies on the bed staring absently at the ac sitting 
               motionless beside the camera a few feet away. neither speaks 
               for a long moment.

                                     gaffer
                         i think we got nudity today.

                                     ac
                              (reads from his 
                              callsheet)
                         it just says "scene six: ellen and 
                         damian kiss."

                                     gaffer
                         could be a kiss with nudity.

                                     ac
                         i like ellen. she's my type.

                                     gaffer
                         why is that?

                                     ac
                         she's pretty. smart. kind of kooky.

                                     gaffer
                         maybe i'll give her a part. that's 
                         right; i'm makin' my own movie pretty 
                         soon.

                                     ac
                         oh yeah?

                                     gaffer
                         yup. feature. i brought my script.

               the gaffer tugs a thin, tattered script, folded lengthwise, 
               out of his back pocket.

                                     gaffer
                         palomino's perfect for the lead. i'm 
                         going to give it to him right during 
                         lunch. maybe right after.

                                     ac
                         alright.

                                     gaffer
                         got to be aggressive. you want to 
                         shoot it?

                                     ac
                         sure.

                                     gaffer
                         you ever shot anything?

                                     ac
                         no.

                                     gaffer
                         that's alright; got to start 
                         somewhere.

               suddenly the gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the ac's 
               hand.
