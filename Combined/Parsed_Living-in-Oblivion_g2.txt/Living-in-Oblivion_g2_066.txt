               empty set.

                                     nick
                         nicole, i'm sorry. i didn't mean it. 
                         you were great in that richard gere 
                         movie.

                                     nicole
                         shut up. you're no different than he 
                         is. you lie, you're deceitful...

                                     nick
                         i'm not lying. christ, i tell everyone 
                         how great you are. i've got nothing 
                         but respect and admiration for you.

                                     nicole
                         oh god, now you're doing your own 
                         fucking script.

                                     nick
                         well, why do you think i wrote it?!

                                     nicole
                         i have no idea!

                                     nick
                         it's about you. it's about how i 
                         feel about you.

                                     nicole
                         christ, did you get a bump on your 
                         head, nicky. 'cause you're talking 
                         like an idiot.

                                     nick
                         nicole. i've loved you since the day 
                         we met.

               nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.

                                     nicole
                         why didn't you tell me?

                                     nick
                         i didn't want anything to get in the 
                         way of us working together.

                                     nicole
                         god, and all this time i thought...

               nick and nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.
