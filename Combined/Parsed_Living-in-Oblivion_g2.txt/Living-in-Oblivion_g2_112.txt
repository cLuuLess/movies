               int. the set. day

               ms nick, his head and body jerking in a sudden spasm. he 
               finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and 
               the sound man frowns hard at him.

               cu the sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds 
               have passed. the camera stays on the watch until the final 
               five seconds have elapsed.

                                     sound
                         and, that's a cut on room tone.

               the room erupts with activity. everyone moves and talks at 
               once. nick whispers something to nicole then runs off.

                                     wanda

               ws the set. suddenly the fake door closes right into the 
               lens, turning the frame completely black.

               end credits.
