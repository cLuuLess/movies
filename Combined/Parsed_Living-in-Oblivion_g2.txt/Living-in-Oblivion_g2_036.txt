               quick cut to extreme cu nick's face, just as his eyes open. 
               the film is in color now. the room is in heavy darkness except 
               for the light on nick's face. nick reaches over and shuts 
               off his clock radio. the digital dial shows 4:00 a.m. the 
               beeping finally stops.

               nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat 
               and still breathing heavily.

                                     nick
                         god...
                              (this is not a sigh 
                              of relief)

               the camera dollies swiftly back away from nick. he stares at 
               it in stunned amazement. just then a door closes right into 
               the lens turning the frame into complete blackness.

               out of the blackness a door opens away from the camera 
               revealing wanda looking into her closet (the camera is inside 
               the closet). from this point on, the rest of the film is in 
               color except where specifically indicated to be black and 
               white.
