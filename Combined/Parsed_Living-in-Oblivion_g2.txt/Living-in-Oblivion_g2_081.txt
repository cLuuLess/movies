               nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking 
               genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of 
               smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine.

                                     nicole

               tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a 
               circle holding the apple just beyond her reach. the smoke is 
               so thick both of them are barely visible. just as tito gets 
               to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous 
               explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding 
               smoke.
