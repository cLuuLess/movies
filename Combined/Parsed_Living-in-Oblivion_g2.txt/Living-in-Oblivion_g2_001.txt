               ext. street. nyc. night

               a quiet, deserted industrial street. it is over an hour before 
               dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness 
               of night.

               in the weak light filtering out of their battered van, bert 
               and cybil -- the craft service managers, finish setting out 
               breakfast supplies on a 6' table. they work in almost complete 
               silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. a cheap walkie-
               talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy oreos, sputters 
               and buzzes occasionally. other items on the table include a 
               mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered 
               donuts.

                                     bert
                         what time is it?

                                     cybil
                         four. why?

                                     bert
                         this milk is bad.

                                     cybil
                              (sniffs)
                         when did you buy it?

                                     bert
                         tuesday? i don't know. what's today?

                                     cybil
                         monday.
                              (pause)
                         there's a deli on broadway.

                                     bert
                         nothing closer?

                                     cybil
                         nothing that's open.

                                     bert
                              (sniffs the milk)
                         is it that bad?

                                     cybil
                         i don't know. you're the one who 
                         said it was bad.

               at that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and 
               shudders to a stop in front of the building. bert replaces 
               the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.
