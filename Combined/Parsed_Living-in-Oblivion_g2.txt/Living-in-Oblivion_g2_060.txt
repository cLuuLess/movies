               int. off the set. day

               nick follows palomino behind the set, stopping just beside 
               the fake set window. palomino whirls on nick and whispers 
               fiercely.

                                     palomino
                         i'm out of here, man!

                                     nick
                         what's the matter?!

                                     palomino
                         i like you, but i made a big mistake 
                         taking this part. have someone call 
                         me a cab.

                                     nick
                         wait a second, chad. just talk to 
                         me. what's going on!?

                                     palomino
                         i can't act with this woman. i know 
                         she's a friend of yours but i got to 
                         tell you: she cannot act worth a 
                         shit! i'm giving her everything! the 
                         whole thing i just did with the hair; 
                         did you see that? i came up with 
                         that on my own because i thought it 
                         would help her. but no, she's giving 
                         me nothing! i'm out of here.
