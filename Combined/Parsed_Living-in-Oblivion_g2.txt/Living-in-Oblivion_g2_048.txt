                         ok, let's make sure we know what's 
                         going on here. these two people have 
                         loved each other for years, each of 
                         them not knowing the other was in 
                         love with them. and tonight, in this 
                         little room it all comes out. it's 
                         like a dam bursting. does that make 
                         sense? nicole?

                                     nicole
                         it makes perfect sense. i just haven't 
                         found it yet. i'll get it though.

                                     nick
                         what about you, chad?

                                     palomino
                         i'm there, man. i got the dam going, 
                         the river, everything. you watch, 
                         that little change in the blocking 
                         is going to open the whole scene up 
                         for me.

                                     wanda (v.o.)
                         we're ready, nick!

                                     nick
                         good. let's go.
