               int. off the set. day

               wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly 
               in a chair beside cora. he does not speak to her and gazes 
               blankly out at nick, tito, and nicole on the set some distance 
               away. cora however stares at the side of his head with such 
               intensity wolf can't help but turn to her.

               cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares 
               even more intently into his eye.

               wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. cora continues 
               to stare at him. suddenly, his eye is full of tears. cora 
               watches in rapt silence. wolf is crying openly now. cora 
               reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently 
               lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. a tight smile of 
               satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is 
               released, streaming quickly down wolf's cheek. no one sees 
               this.
