                         cut!!!!

                                     wanda
                         what the fuck is that?! sound?

                                     sound
                              (frantically checking 
                              his equipment)
                         it's not me.

                                     boom
                         it's the camera.

                                     wolf
                         the fuck it is. it's off; it's not 
                         even running.

               the beep continues, growing louder.

                                     wanda
                              (into her walkie)
                         what's going on down there?! do i 
                         have a lock-up?! nothing? you don't 
                         hear a beeping sound?
                              (to nick)
                         the street's quiet.

                                     nick
                         then what the fuck is it!!?

                                     ac
                         it's somebody's watch!

               everybody holds their watches up to their ears.

                                     wolf
                         not mine.

                                     wanda
                         not mine.

                                     sound
                         not mine.

                                     boom
                         not mine.

               and so on, until all watches have been checked with negative 
               results. the beeping continues, growing louder and louder.

               suddenly nick loses it. he starts running around the set, 
               ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. 
               he shoves cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, 
               heaving them against the wall with a startling violence.

                                     nick
                         where is it!! you motherfucker! you 
                         cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! 
                         where the fuck are you!? where!! 
                         where!!

               everyone watches nick demolish the set in stunned, open-
               mouthed amazement. nick turns to the crew in rage.

                                     nick
                         can someone help me please?! do i 
                         have to do everything myself here?!

               nick loses it completely.

                                     nick
                         hey, cora. why don't you go learn 
                         your lines! hey scriptgirl, are you 
                         finally going to pay attention here?! 
                         hey, focus puller, you want to make 
                         a movie or get stoned?! huh, i got

                         a little more distracting to my 
                         actors!
                              (to the gaffer)
                         hey bob! hi bob! can you please make 
                         a little more noise on the dolly you

                              (to cybil)
                         what is your name!? what do you 
                         fucking do around here?!
                              (to the soundman)
                         hey speedo, what's the matter? can't 
                         even find a teeny fucking beep?!

               cu of nicole. she turns away, unable to watch anymore. the 
               beeping continues.

                                     nick
                         see what i have to put up with, 
                         nicole!? maybe next time you'll do 
                         some of that magic on camera!? but 
                         no, no -- wait till wolf is puking 
                         his guts out, "oh now i'll be good!!"

               ws, the entire room. nick's last word echoes throughout the 
               silent set. suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished 
               set and lets out a long, wrenching scream.
