               int. bathroom. day

               nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. leaning 
               closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair 
               falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.

                                     nick
                         would you care to have a drink 
                         tonight? hey, nicole, what do you 
                         say you and i have a drink tonight?

               suddenly the door opens behind him and nicole walks in.

                                     nicole
                         oh, nick! i'm sorry!

                                     nick
                         that's ok, no problem. i'm just 
                         slapping a little water on my face.

               the two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. nick looks 
               like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.

                                     nick
                         so, it's going pretty good, huh?

                                     nicole
                         is it? something feels off.

                                     nick
                         yeah, you seem a little tense.

                                     nicole
                         do i?

                                     nick
                         but don't worry about it. just take 
                         your attention off yourself and put 
                         it on chad. work off him a little 
                         more.

                                     nicole
                         ok, i'll try that.

                                     nick
                         and listen, i know he's no olivier. 
                         but he's got something, don't you 
                         think? kind of a natural presence.

                                     nicole
                         oh yes, he's very natural.

               nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the 
               question.

                                     nick
                         so nicole... anything else i can 
                         help you with?

                                     nicole
                         actually there is. could you maybe 
                         ask him to brush his teeth?

                                     nick
                         oh, sure.
