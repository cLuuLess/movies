               int. car. dawn

               the car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. jeff, the 
               intern and nick, the director, sit quietly in the motionless 
               car.

                                     nick
                         should we call up to the room again?

                                     jeff
                         he said he'd be right down.

               nick lets out a huge yawn.

                                     jeff
                         tired?

                                     nick
                         i'm exhausted. i dreamt i was on the 
                         set all night. i was just trying to 
                         do one shot and everything kept going 
                         wrong.

                                     jeff
                         that's an anxiety dream. are you 
                         anxious about something?

                                     nick
                         i don't know. sometimes i wonder 
                         what the hell i'm doing in this 
                         business. it's all just one compromise 
                         and disappointment after another. i 
                         don't know if i have the personality 
                         for it.

                                     jeff
                         sounds kind of like an identity 
                         crisis.

                                     nick
                         maybe you're right. who am i? what 
                         am i really capable of? maybe i should 
                         just get a job teaching at a women's 
                         college somewhere.

                                     jeff
                         how'd you get into cinematography?

                                     nick
                         i'm not a cinematographer.

                                     jeff
                         you're not?

                                     nick
                         no. i'm directing this movie.

                                     jeff
                              (pause)
                         how'd you get into directing?
