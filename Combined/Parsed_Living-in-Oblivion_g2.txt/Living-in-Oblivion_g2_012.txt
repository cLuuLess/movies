               int. apt. the scene: take 3. color

               the scene begins once again. remarkably, nicole's enormous 
               commitment is just as full and sharp. nick is in ecstasy.

                                     nicole
                         dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         it didn't hurt that much but i started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. he went over and started 
                         hitting danny.

                                     cora
                         ellen, i have no memory of this 
                         whatsoever.

               suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap 
               song blasting out of its trunk-mounted speakers.
