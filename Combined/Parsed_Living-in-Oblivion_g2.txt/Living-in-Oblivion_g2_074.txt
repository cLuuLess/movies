               int. the dream. take one. day

               nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. her 
               white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red 
               walls. a sad shred of smoke drifts by her head.

                                     nicole
                         i am so hungry.

               tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at nicole. 
               his sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. he walks around 
               her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her 
               reach. he stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a cu 
               of him. he doesn't laugh. nick watches this for a moment in 
               intense concentration.
