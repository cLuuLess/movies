               int. set apt. day. b/w

               screen is still white. gradually it shifts back to proper 
               exposure revealing nicole in medium cu. her eyes are riveting; 
               it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. a 
               light meter is thrust in front of her face. she barely 
               registers it.

               ws, the entire living room set. nicole sits on a sofa facing 
               cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. two flats have 
               been joined at right angles to create the living room corner. 
               a table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the 
               rather scrawny looking set.

               most of the movie crew is seen, including wolf looking through 
               the camera.

                         ok, picture's up. quiet. stop the 
                         work. lock it up. going for picture.

               nick approaches nicole and cora.

                                     nick
                         ok, nice and easy. cora you're doing 
                         fine. remember, really listen and 
                         really answer.
                              (smiles at nicole)
                         i've got nothing to say to you. just 
                         let it happen. it's all there.

                                     wanda
                         ready, nick?

                                     wolf
                         look at this a second, nick.

               nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. 
               another cu of nicole fills the frame. the image is visually 
               and emotionally breathtaking.

                                     wolf
                         i pushed in a foot. she's incredible. 
                         it's coming right through the lens.

               nick grips wolf's shoulder in gratitude.

                                     nick
                         that's great, man. beautiful.
