                         dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         it didn't hurt that much but i started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. he went over and started 
                         hitting danny.

                                     cora
                         i...

               there is a long awkward pause as cora realizes she can't 
               remember her line.
