                         just get a flatbed trailer with about

                         his car.

               everyone nods in annoyed agreement; everyone except the boom 
               man who appears to be following the music with the mike, 
               bopping to it through the headphones. slowly, interminably, 
               the music fades off into the distance.

                                     sound
