                                     nicole
                         you tell me! you're the one with the 
                         bug up your ass!

                                     nick

                                     nicole
                         you've been picking on me all day! i 
                         can't do anything right!

                                     nick
                         i'm sorry if i was short with you, 
                         nicole, but i think you can see i'm 
                         under a little pressure here. i'm 
                         shooting a dream sequence without a 
                         smoke machine, my mother's out there 
                         thinking she's at a circus wedding 
                         and you tell me the whole movie seems 
                         fake!

                                     nicole
                         i never said that!

                                     nick
                         you did too. you said, "everything 
                         feels fake."

                                     nicole
                         i meant me! i feel fake! everything 
                         i'm doing feels fake. i can't act. i 
                         should just do shower scenes in 
                         richard gere movies for the rest of 
                         my life!

                                     nick
                         nicole, that's ridiculous. you're a 
                         fantastic actress. all you have to 
                         do is show me you want that apple 
                         more than anything else in the world; 
                         don't give up. understand? you cannot 
                         give up.

                                     nicole
                         ok.

               suddenly wanda yells out.

                                     wanda
                         ready, nick?!

                                     nick
                         ready!
