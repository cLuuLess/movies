               int. the set production office. day

               wanda speaks urgently into the phone while nicole stands 
               beside her. jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance 
               clutching nick's red notebook.

                                     wanda
                         cora reve, r-e-v-e. blue housecoat, 
                         blue slippers. how do i know? because 
                         she's sitting ten feet away from me. 
                         well sweetheart, that's going to be 
                         a real fucking problem.

               nicole turns away and walks past jeff to the craft service 
               table.

                                     jeff
                         she was waiting outside nick's 
                         apartment when i went to pick up his 
                         notebook. she said she was looking 
                         for him so i figured i should just 
                         bring her up here. you look really 
                         pretty in that dress.

               nicole nods politely then looks to the makeup corner where 
               nick sits talking earnestly to his mother.
