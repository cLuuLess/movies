               int. the set. day

               nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.

                                     palomino
                         god, and all this time i thought...
                              (the muted rustle of 
                              the kiss)

               the sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, 
               sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword 
               puzzle. nicole is just about to take off the headphones when 
               she realizes she can hear nick and palomino talking quite 
               clearly. glancing up, she sees the boom man has left his 
               boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the 
               open set window.

                                     palomino (v.o.)
                         why did you cast her? she sucked in 
                         that richard gere movie!

                                     nick (v.o.)
                         you're right. she is not the best 
                         actress in the world. i see that now 
                         but you've got to help me, chad. i'm 
                         asking you to please help me here. 
                         we've got to get through this somehow.

               the camera begins a slow dolly in to nicole's astonished 
               face. this will be intercut with a similar dolly in to the 
               microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ecu of the 
               mike.
