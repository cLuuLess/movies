               dissolve to a nurse moving quickly past the camera and out 
               the open door of the hospital room.

               cu nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. still 
               confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. 
               the woman's face is pale and drawn. as nicole leans closer 
               her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair 
               away from her face. the gesture is one of love, acceptance, 
               and farewell. it is identical to the one we have just seen 
               cora make to her.
