               int. the scene. take five. the improv

               nicole stays seated, though palomino moves around making a 
               great show of loosening up.

                                     nicole
                         i've always admired you from afar.

                                     palomino
                         have you? that's, wow; that's 
                         incredible. but that sounds kind of 
                         professional doesn't it? admired?

                                     nicole
                         you're right. how does despised sound?

                                     palomino
                         great!
                              (laughs)
                         what's it mean?

                                     nicole
                              (laughs)
                         it's sort of like i think you're a 
                         piece of shit.

               palomino is somewhat startled by this. he looks to nick in 
               confusion. nick silently encourages him to keep going.

                                     palomino
                              (another laugh)
                         that sounds like the champagne 
                         talking.

                                     nicole
                         it's not. i really do think you are 
                         a piece of shit.

                                     palomino
                         no, you don't. you love me.

                                     nicole
                         the fuck i do. i can't stand looking 
                         at you!

                                     palomino
                         then i guess i have nothing else to 
                         say.

                                     nicole
                         no, i think you have a lot more to 
                         say, damian.

                                     palomino
                         well, i am surprised you feel this 
                         way, ellen. i always thought you 
                         admired --

                                     nicole
                         that's not what i meant. you should 
                         tell everyone what you just told 
                         nick behind the set.

                                     palomino
                         hey, this isn't part of the scene.

                                     nicole
                         say it anyway: the reason this scene 
                         isn't working is because you and i 
                         slept together last night. did 
                         everyone hear that?! i fucked chad 
                         last night!

               nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.

                                     palomino
                         see, nick! i told you this was about 
                         rejection!

                                     nicole
                         you fucking scumbag! you think i 
                         give a rat's ass about you?! i was 
                         there to get laid and even that was 
                         a joke!

                                     palomino
                         you know, you are really starting to 
                         piss me off!

                                     nicole
                         oh, does that mean you're not going 
                         to come wiggle on the bed anymore, 
                         or stroke my hair real soft and 
                         concerned, or kiss me like a soap 
                         opera acting piece of shit!

               palomino snaps, and lunges for nicole. she leaps to the other 
               side of the bed.

                                     nicole
                         come on! i'll kick your ass! come 
                         on!

               nick steps between nicole and palomino.

                                     nick
                         ok, guys, i think we can stop there.

                                     palomino
                         you bet your ass we can stop! wanda, 
                         call me a cab!

                                     nick
                         hold on, chad. let's just try to 
                         calm down.

                                     palomino
                         fuck you. i'm out of here, man. this 
                         movie is bullshit.

                                     nick
                         now wait a second, chad. there's no 
                         reason for hostility.

                                     palomino
                         shut up, you fucking loser. the only 
                         reason i took this part was because 
                         someone said you knew quentin 
                         tarantino! you're nowhere, man.

                                     nick
                         hey, you want to go? go! i'm sick of 
                         your shit, you hostess twinkie 
                         motherfucker!

                                     palomino
                         what'd you call me?

                                     nick
                         you heard me.

                                     palomino
                         say it again.

                                     nick
                         you hostess twinkie motherfucker!

               palomino suddenly punches nick in the stomach, leaving him 
               bent over and gasping for breath. nicole instantly leaps on 
               palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of 
               his head. palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as 
               wanda rushes forward.

                                     wanda
                         alright, everyone just stop. stop! 
                         stop this right now!

               as she tries to separate nicole and palomino, palomino shoves 
               her hard, knocking her down. instantly wolf leaps off the 
               camera and runs up to palomino.

                                     wolf
                         alright, you've asked for it, chad!

               palomino suddenly punches wolf in the teeth, dropping him 
               like a stone.

                                     wanda
                              (shrieks)
                         wolf!

               suddenly nick staggers to his feet and rushes at palomino. 
               his momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, 
               palomino's head cracking nicole in the teeth.

                                     nicole
                         oh, god!

               nicole rolls free as nick and palomino wrestle on the bed. 
               nick gets palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding 
               his head against the mattress.

                                     nick
                         you want to pick my brain?! this is 
                         the way i direct hostess twinkie 
                         scumbags like you!

               as nick continues to pound palomino's head the gaffer notices 
               palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of 
               nick's forearm around his neck. he and the boom man rush 
               forward and finally manage to pry palomino free.

                                     nick
                         get him out of here! someone take 
                         him back to his hotel!

               as the gaffer and boom man drag off the almost unconscious 
               palomino, the scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.

                                     script
                              (sniffling)
                         chad...

               suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for nick's labored 
               breathing and the scriptgirl's sniffles. nick leans over and 
               touches nicole's shoulder.

                                     nick
                         are you alright?

                                     nicole
                         don't touch me.
