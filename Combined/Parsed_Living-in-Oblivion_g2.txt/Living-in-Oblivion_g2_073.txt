               int. the set. day

               nick is working with the crew and the actors. the set consists 
               of two flats (one with the fake door) joined to make a corner. 
               the flats are painted fire-engine red.

                                     nick
                         ok, here's the shot. we start wide 
                         with ellen standing absolutely still 
                         right in the middle of the frame. 
                         you got that, wolf?

                                     wolf
                         yeah.

                                     nick
                              (notices eyepatch)
                         what happened to your eye?

                                     wolf
                         nothing. it's a little sensitive 
                         today.

                                     nick
                         can you see?

                                     wolf
                              (snaps)
                         of course i can see!

               for a moment nick looks like he might snap back at wolf but 
               he draws a deep breath and continues.

                                     nick
                         ok, ellen is standing there. the 
                         smoke is flowing in and: ellen's 
                         line.

                                     nicole
                         i am so hungry.

                                     nick
                         good, tito, that's your cue.

               the fake door opens and tito enters wearing his top hat and 
               carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands.

                                     nick
                         you walk around her once, hold the 
                         apple out, that's right; just beyond 
                         her reach. you're staring at her 
                         hard. harder, good. then stop right 
                         here. can we get a mark, please?

               the ac moves up to nick and places a piece of yellow tape on 
               the floor. cu the yellow tape.

                                     nick
                         then we dolly in to tito's close-up. 
                         alright, wolf?

                                     wanda
                         it should be hand-held.

                                     nick
                         no, i think it's better on the dolly.

                                     wolf
                         whatever.

                                     nicole
                         nick, do i see him?

                                     nick
                         no, just the apple. and tito, right 
                         after we dolly in give me a little 
                         laugh there.

                                     tito
                         a little laugh?

                                     nick

                         doing. ok? good. let's shoot one.

                         action on the smoke.

               the gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic 
               wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates.

                                     wanda
                         and roll sound.

                         more smoke? is that possible?

                                     gaffer
                         oh, sure.

               the gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke 
               wheezes out.

                                     nick
