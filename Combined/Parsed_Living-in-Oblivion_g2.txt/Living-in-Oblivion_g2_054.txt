               int. craft service table. day

               several members of the crew loiter around the table. the 
               scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup 
               of coffee in the other. palomino notices her and moves quietly 
               to her side. without a word he picks up the milk and pours 
               some in her coffee. nicole stands nearby and watches the 
               following exchange.

                                     script
                         thanks.

                                     palomino
                         my pleasure. sugar?

                                     script
                         just a bit.

               palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care.

                                     palomino
                         you like jazz?

                                     script
                         very much.

                                     palomino
                         maybe we could go hear some tonight.

               palomino smiles and moves away just as wanda comes up for a 
               coffee refill.

                                     wanda

                         think?

                                     script
                         very well. what time do you think 
                         we'll finish?

                                     wanda
                         early i hope. i'm going to a jazz 
                         club tonight.

                                     script

                         isn't he?

                         chad?

                         he's so natural, like... air.

               nicole approaches.

                                     script
                         i wonder what his sign is. do you 
                         know, nicole?

                                     nicole
                         i don't know his sign, but i think 
                         his moon is in uranus.

               wanda chokes hard on her coffee as nicole walks off with a 
               bitter smile.

                                     script
                         you don't have to be nasty.
