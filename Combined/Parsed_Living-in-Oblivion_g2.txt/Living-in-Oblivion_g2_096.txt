               nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to wanda, wolf, 
               and the rest of the crew.

                                     nick

                         right away.

               wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) 
               as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into 
               position. on a terse signal from nick the camera starts 
               rolling.
