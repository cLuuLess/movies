               int. a corner. day

               as soon as wolf and nick reach the darkened corner, wolf 
               whirls to face nick.

                                     wolf
                         i really don't like being spoken to 
                         like that, nick!

                                     nick
                         yeah, well i don't like your attitude!

                                     wolf
                         i don't have an attitude!

                                     nick
                         the hell you don't! every time i ask 
                         you to do something all i get is no, 
                         no, no and i'm sick of it! i hired 
                         you to do a job; if you're not going 
                         to do it you better let me know right 
                         now!

               wolf is about to yell back at nick when suddenly he stops 
               and lets out a deep, painful sigh.

                                     wolf
                         i'm sorry, nick. i'm going through 
                         some heavy shit.

                                     nick
                         what do you mean?

                                     wolf
                         i can't really go into it. it's pretty 
                         heavy.

                                     nick
                         personal?

               wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward wanda who is 
               standing some distance away watching them. seeing the two 
               men looking at her wanda shoots them a hard glare which 
               prompts wolf and nick to turn away quickly.

                                     wolf
                         personal, professional, emotional. 
                         it's doing a number on me. and now 
                         you're telling me you're going to 
                         fire me.

                                     nick
                         i didn't say that, wolf. come on, 
                         i'm not going to fire you. you're 
                         doing a great job here.

                                     wolf
                         am i?

                                     nick
                         yeah, i don't know what i'd do without 
                         you, man. you've got a great eye. i 
                         just hope it's not the one under 
                         that eyepatch.

               nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but wolf's only response 
               is to stare back at him sadly.

                                     nick
                         listen, wolf. let me tell you one 
                         thing i've learned; sometimes you 
                         just have to roll with things. you 
                         know?

                                     wolf
                         you're right.

                                     nick
                         roll with it, man. you'll be ok.

               wolf lets out another deep sigh.

                                     wolf
                         thanks, bro.
