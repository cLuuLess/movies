40   int. hope house - foyer - moments later                         40

     mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place.
     piper is where we left him, watching vh1 in the tv room.

                                                         30.


mackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more
have you seen me's... he reaches the door.

                        piper
              ever seen a fifty-foot shark?

mackelway stops, turns.

                        mackelway
              i'm sorry?

                        piper
              fifty-foot shark. ever seen one?

                        mackelway
              no.

                        piper
              doesn't mean there aren't any.

great. mackelway reaches for the front door again. then he
halts. maybe this guy can be helpful. mackelway turns:

                     mackelway
           did you know him?
               (piper's silent)
           the guy who used to stay upstairs.
           "o'ryan." did you know him?

                     piper
           why? is he dead?

                       mackelway
           i don't...

                     piper
           you said "did." is he dead?

                     mackelway
           oh. i mis-spoke. no, he's not dead...
               (a beat)
           you know him?

piper nods.

mackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that
image: the circle-with-slash-through-it.

                        mackelway (cont'd)
              he ever talk about this? a circle with a
              slash through it?

                                                                 31.


     piper rises, crosses to us... leaning in unnecessarily close.
     it's unsettling.

                          piper
                that's not a circle. it's a zero.

                          mackelway
                oh. how do you know?

     piper doesn't answer. instead he simply starts whistling.

     but it's not a tune coming out of his mouth. it's that same
     sound that o'ryan made: a whistling wind, blowing through a
     ghost town... building, then falling again.

     piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it,
     stifling a giggle...

     then, suddenly, everything turns grainy, choppy...

     we've jumped into a distorted, remote pov of this same scene -
     as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or
     a distance of time and space...

     we see images, fragments: piper, the tv, the sofa, mackelway's
     face. then all sound breaks up, and we are...
