31   int. "club" - backstage - resuming flashback                   31

     bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a circle, and a donkey-show
     taking place on a bare stage. feels like we've stepped into
     some kind of evil carnival. it's dizzying.

     among the crowd: virgil starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the
     only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing.

     suddenly our gun is pointed right at his head.

     starkey freezes, caught. some of the patrons around him find
     somewhere else to stand... but the show goes on.
