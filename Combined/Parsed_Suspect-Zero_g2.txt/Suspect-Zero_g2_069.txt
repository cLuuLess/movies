     that truck has just thundered by, leaving a swirl of debris in
     its wake. we tilt up from it... to find that those stormclouds
     once in the distance are upon us now.

     and they are pulsing with menace. rain, wind, lightning,
     thunder. like a black wave, about to descend...
