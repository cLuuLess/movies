     mackelway turns, a bit startled. dyson is approaching, fax in
     hand.

                            mackelway
                huh?

     dyson extends six pages. on the top-sheet, written by hand,
     are the words: "agent thomas mackelway, c/o mr. david dyson,
     hope house" with a street address.

     and under that top sheet? five more pages.

     mackelway sighs, takes them from dyson. sure enough, he's
     staring at five more faces, five more fact sheets. five more
     have you seen me's.

     but how would anyone know to send them here?

                          dyson
                anything urgent?

                            mackelway
                      (doesn't look up)
                no.

     dyson is glad to hear it.
