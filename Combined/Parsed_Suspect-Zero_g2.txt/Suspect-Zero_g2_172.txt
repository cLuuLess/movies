178   int. mackelway's yukon - driving - moments later               178

      through sparse traffic, heading for an interstate on-ramp.
                          o'ryan (cont'd)
                i'm talking about uncompromised justice.
                no trials. no lawyers. no hiccups in a
                chain of evidence that can set a monster
                free. you of all people should be able to
                appreciate the value of that.

                          mackelway
                where's the boy?

                          o'ryan
                i won't be doing this much longer.
                actually, this is the end of it. i've
                          (more)

                                                         98.


                     o'ryan (cont'd)
           come to accept that. but there is one
           last thing to--

                     mackelway
               (anger rising)
           where's the boy, o'ryan?

                     o'ryan
           do we have an understanding?

mackelway pulls the car over, under an i-30 overpass... and
out comes his gun, pointed right at o'ryan's forehead.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           enough of this shit. where's the boy?

o'ryan can't help it. he's pleased.

                     o'ryan
           good. this is good. sort of thing you'd
           never find in a procedural manual. it
           tells me i was right about you.

                     mackelway
               (cocking the hammer)
           i will kill you, o'ryan.

                     o'ryan
           i know. but we have work to do first.

                     mackelway
           where's the goddamn kid?!?!

silence... then that cel-phone rings. must be fran.

                     o'ryan
           don't pick that up.

mackelway eyes him: are you kidding? it rings again.

                    o'ryan (cont'd)
              (a panicked offer)
          this is the guy who put all those pins in
          that map of yours! and i can take you to
          him!

ring #3. mackelway grabs the phone.

                     mackelway
           fine. where is he?
               (silence)
           where is he?!?!

                                                                  99.


      silence, punctuated by ring #4. then o'ryan smiles... and
      points to his own forehead.

                           o'ryan
                 right here...

      mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh.

                             mackelway
                 fuck you.

      he punches the "talk" button, taking his eyes off o'ryan for a
      split second.

      ...what follows is a blur:

      o'ryan lunges forward like an animal, throwing his cuffed
      wrists over mackelway's head, yanking mackelway out of his
      seat with a violent tug. the gun falls.

      we pop outside the yukon, pulling back... obscuring our view
      of what's going on inside that truck.

      that cel-phone continues to ring... we keep pulling back,
      under this sparsely-trafficked overpass, rain falling.

      the cel-phone stops ringing. continue pulling back, taking in
      the expanse of highway - cars rolling by without a hint of the
      peril beneath them...

                                                       cut to:
