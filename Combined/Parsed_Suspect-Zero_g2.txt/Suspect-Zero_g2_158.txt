      mackelway stands opposite a day-manager: 30, harried, eyeing a
      copy of the composite drawing of o'ryan.

                 naah. i never saw that guy in here.

                                                                89.


                           mackelway
                 he sent a fax from this location 'bout
                 seven o'clock this morning.

                           day-manager
                 we're closed at seven.

                           mackelway
                 are your faxes programmable? could he
                 have paid last night to have it sent this
                 morning?

                           day-manager
                 sure. but that costs extra.

                           mackelway
                 were you here last night?

                           day-manager
                 nope. haven't done nights since i got
                 promoted.

      mackelway eyes the guy... then hears a cel-phone ring.

                           mackelway
                 'scuse me.

      mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter.

                            mackelway (cont'd)
                     (into cel)
                 mackelway.
