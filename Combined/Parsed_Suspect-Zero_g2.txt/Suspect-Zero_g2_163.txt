169   ext. truck-stop - parking lot - moments later                    169

      mackelway backs out in the yukon, trying to keep a visual on
      vic's truck.

      another 18-wheeler pulls in front of him, blocking his view
      entirely.

                                                                  93.


                           mackelway
                 dammit!

      he honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading
      for the exit of the lot.

      just spotted vic's rig again.
