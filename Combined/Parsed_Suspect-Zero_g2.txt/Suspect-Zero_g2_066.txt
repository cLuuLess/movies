67   int. "furnace room" - continuing                                  67

     five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by
     steel mesh. mackelway enters. a few meager bulbs burn.

     he moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the
     humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath
     us. he walks along the edge of furnace #1...

     ...and is assaulted, from above.

     o'ryan falls on him, knocking mackelway hard into the sharp
     corner of that furnace, then down to the ground. mackelway's
     gun skids across the floor.

     and his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze.

                                                                46.


     he wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head
     is swimming. something's on that gauze. the room is getting
     fuzzy.

     we see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. then our own
     blood... (mackelway's chest was torn open by the corner of
     that furnace.) wait. did we just see the glint of a knife?

     o'ryan is leaning over us, in utter control.

     then o'ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of
     footsteps. and we hear:

                          male voice (o.s.)
                hey! you! what're you doing down here!

     we turn, groggily. two janitors rush toward us, keys jangling.
     it's all foggy, wavy, distorted.

     we see o'ryan rise. then everything goes black...

                                                      cut to:
