15   int. speck's home - living room - moments later (day)             15

     shocked faces. food on unmatching trays. speck's wife - jan,
     40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile. friends and family
     mill about, tending to her.

     kids hover. two of them, a 4-year-old boy and an 8-year-old
     girl, sniff back tears as people offer condolences.

     but the focus here is jan - her grief. she's shaking...

                          o'ryan (o.s.)
                mrs. speck?

     she looks up. o'ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty
     faces in here. jan half-nods.

                          o'ryan (cont'd)
                just wanted to offer my condolences.
                    (takes her hand)
                i didn't know him well but... i think
                harold was a much more complex man than
                people realized.

     jan is so raw that anything about speck touches her now.

                                                                  15.


                          jan
                    (through tears)
                he was, wasn't he?

                          o'ryan
                i'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

     she sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. o'ryan
     extends his hand to her. she takes it. he moves off.

     beside her is a framed portrait of speck. we blow past it, and
     into the black crepe that is adorning the corner of the
     portrait's frame, and:

     bam! we're rocketed back into a set of odd images again:
