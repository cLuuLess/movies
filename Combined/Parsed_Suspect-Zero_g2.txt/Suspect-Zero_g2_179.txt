186   int. mackelway's yukon - driving - night                          186

      a huge storm devours scenery on both sides of us. o'ryan
      drives. mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face,
      still recovering from what happened in that room...

      silence... then:

                           mackelway
                 tell me about icarus.

                           o'ryan
                 why?

                           mackelway
                 just... wanna know.

      o'ryan eyes him. the sky is black.

                           o'ryan
                 there were five of us. in the program.

      mackelway's all ears...

                           o'ryan (cont'd)
                 we'd come in in the morning, have a cup
                 of coffee, talk about the yankees. then
                 you'd go to your room, with your pen and
                           (more)

                                                         108.


                       o'ryan (cont'd)
             your pad of paper, always alone, and
             you'd try to lock in. son of sam. john
             wayne gacy. ted bundy. he might be
             driving his car, or having a beer or
             brushing his teeth... or cutting
             someone's eyes out.

that was said flatly, matter-of-factly. it's chilling.

                        o'ryan (cont'd)
             if you did it right, you got all of it:
             the way it sounded. the way it smelled...
             those people were looking up at you,
             begging you for mercy. it was like being
             god.
                  (a beat)
             ...except you're not. because you can't
             do a thing for them. can't make it stop.
             you're just watching, helpless.

he pauses.

                       o'ryan (cont'd)
             they wired us into this current, the five
             of us: darkness, the pit itself. we were
             plugged right into it. but nobody taught
             us how to shut it off...
                 (thinking back...)
             we were just men. and we saw things men
             shouldn't see. agony, torture, evil - and
             it never shut off. even now, it's still
             there.

                       mackelway
             they all wind up like you? the other
             agents?

                       o'ryan
             no. they're dead now.

oh. mackelway doesn't reply...

                       o'ryan (cont'd)
             they broke down. then they opted out.
                 (mackelway's a blank)
             killed themselves... after a while, those
             conversations about the yankees became
             impossible. ya see?

mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head-
lights. then:

                       mackelway
             i'm sorry.

                                                                   109.


      o'ryan shrugs. he appreciates it. the windshield wipers beat
      back rain...

                                                         cut to:
