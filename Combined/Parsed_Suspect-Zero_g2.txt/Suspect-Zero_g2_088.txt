89   ext. harold speck's house - 6:00 a.m.                              89

     we've been to this house before. suburbia.

     mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place.
     rain falls in sheets, wind blows. and there he is, all alone,
     six in the morning, staring at a house.

     that idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's
     still working on him. beside him is the drawing that was found
     in speck's car:

     the rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic,
     containing body parts in plastic bags... mackelway seems to be
     fixated on it now.
