     tv room is to his left. there, a single 35 year-old drunk/
     transient (we'll call him "piper") sits, watching "behind the
     music" on vh1. tonight's subject? leif garret...

     piper doesn't look up, or acknowledge mackelway at all. rather
     he increases the tv volume to drown out the singing upstairs,
     which seems to be intentionally off-key.

     torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window. posters and
     fliers on the walls. 10 bedrooms upstairs.

                          dyson (o.s.)
                agent mackelway?

     mackelway turns. descending a creaking stairway is david
     dyson: 50, lean, with a friendly smile.

                                                      cut to:

                                                               24.
