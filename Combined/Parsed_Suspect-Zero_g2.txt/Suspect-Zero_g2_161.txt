      mackelway sits at a table by a window. watching. fifty massive
      trucks in this lot - some refrigerated, most not.

      this diner is big enough to seat 200: truckers, a few
      families, and folks who just like the buffet, (gravy covers
      just about every entree.)

      mackelway's been here for hours. a waitress comes by.

                           waitress
                 you want some more breakfast, honey, or
                 are we just rollin' right on into lunch?

                                                                 91.

                 just some coffee, thanks. might hit the
                 buffet in a bit.

                           waitress
                 meatloaf's lookin' good today.

      he smiles, thanks. she turns away. that leaves him alone
      again, scanning - not even sure he's in the right place.

      cel-phone rings. he grabs it.
