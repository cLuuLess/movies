      mackelway enters. there's a mirror in here too. that fat
      bandage on his shoulder stares back at him.

      he tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm -
      revealing a hideous wound.

      it's a zero, with a slash through it.

      now everything clicks: o'ryan was branding him. initiating him
      with that red-hot knife.

      mackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. he splashes
      some water on his face, his mind still reeling.

      then o'ryan appears in the doorway. he too looks like hell -
      face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. a long beat...

      mackelway eyes him, incredulous. o'ryan nods, then places that
      drawing of the ranch-house on the sink. mackelway eyes it.

      then o'ryan stuns him... by laying mackelway's gun atop the
      drawing, without a word.

      mackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at
      o'ryan's face, just inches away.

      we're tight on mackelway's hand. it trembles with rage.

      but o'ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. in
      fact he smiles, utterly confident. then:

                           o'ryan
                     (re: gun)
                 soon. i promise... but not yet.

      he eases mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. then
      o'ryan turns, grabs mackelway's car keys, and heads for the
      front door.

      mackelway stands, rigid. he raises the gun. maybe i'll just
      shoot this fucker in the back.

      then those images come at us again, out of nowhere:

                                                                 107.
