21   ext. diner - parking lot - moments later                          21

     fran and mackelway emerge, heading for the bonneville.

                          mackelway
                we ought to work out some kind of
                protocol.

                            fran
                for what?

                          mackelway
                interviews. witnesses. looks pretty
                silly, our talking over one another.

                          fran
                fine. i'll handle them from now on.

     he doesn't argue. they come to a stop at that bonneville,
     stripped down to its primer. time to work...

     two agents, all instinct. we see them study things, details,
     their minds always churning... mackelway pulls out his minox,

     she turns. sure enough, the bonneville's trunk is ajar.
     mackelway approaches, cautiously.

     he doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to
     protect against prints. he opens the trunk.

     first thing he sees is that symbol again: a circle-with-a-
     slash-through-it... staring right at him.

                                                                 21.


     but this time, it's been carved into somebody's back.

     mackelway stares. so does fran. before them lies a body,
     stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged man. dead.

     mackelway sighs. things just got tougher...

                                                      cut to:
