55   int. fbi office - "o'ryan room" - night                          55

     it's 8:30 at night. mackelway is alone in here - staring at
     the map. he's been doing a lot of that lately.

     the stack of have you seen me's has grown as well. every one
     of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map.

                                                           40.


(some of the have you seen me's have arrived via u.s. mail. we
see a stack of envelopes in a box, each sealed in plastic,
each stamped and addressed to mackelway.)

mackelway eyes the map, puzzling. fran's right beside him.
assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he
took himself with that minox.

                      fran
           why you?

                      mackelway
           huh?

                     fran
           he could be sending these to any agent in
           any office in the country... but he's
           sending them to you. why?

mackelway's been asking himself that same question lately.

                     mackelway
           i don't know.

phone rings. she grabs it.

                     fran (into phone)
           this is agent kulok.
               (a beat)
           who's calling?

she hears the answer, then covers the phone.

                     fran (cont'd)
               (to mackelway:)
           do you know a professor named daitz? says
           he's from tulane.

                     mackelway
               (eagerly)
           yeah. criminal psych. i've been trading e-
           mails with him.

                     fran (into phone)
           one moment, please...

she hands him the phone...

                                                 cut to:

                                                                 41.
