172   ext. mackelway - at his car - resuming                            172

      he gets out of the yukon, approaching vic's truck. we cross
      the lot with him.

      he reaches vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. there's
      the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (we
      still can't tell if it's charlie.)

      mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. it's locked. of
      course. and he can't shoot his way in.

      he looks to the kid inside:

                           mackelway
                 you okay?
                     (kid's a blank)
                 kid? you okay in there?

      the kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. shit...
      mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. vic's still
      visible to us, but he won't be for long.

                           mackelway (cont'd)
                     (at the kid)
                 i'll be back. don't worry.

      mackelway heads into the carnival.
