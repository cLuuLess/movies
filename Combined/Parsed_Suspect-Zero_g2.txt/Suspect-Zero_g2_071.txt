72   ext. high school football stadium - same                        72

     a high school marching band is out here, practicing.
     cheerleaders work on their routines nearby.

     then a loud whistle sounds. it's the band-leader, who is
     taking note of the weather gathering overhead. the music from
     the band ceases.

                          band-leader
                everybody into the gym!

     the band-members start to move. lightning erupts overhead.
