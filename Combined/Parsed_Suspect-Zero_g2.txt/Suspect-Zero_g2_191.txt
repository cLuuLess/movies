199   ext. service road - continuing                                 199

      the rig's cab lies driver's-side down. but the passenger-side
      door pops open. and zero pokes through it, his eyes
      immediately scanning that tall wheat. rain pours.

      mackelway's watching. o'ryan, who blacked out for a second now
      opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry.

      zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. only thing in his
      hand is a tire iron. carrying it, he sprints into the wheat
      field - vanishing.

      mackelway bursts out of the yukon, in pursuit. o'ryan's door
      is stuck. mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels
      across the street.

      just then - a state ranger car arrives.

                                                                 115.


                            mackelway
                      (over his shoulder, running)
                 get the van open! he's got a kid in the
                 van!

      state ranger hurries out of his squad car. mackelway sprints
      into the tall wheat.

      o'ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. now he too
      disappears into that wheat field.
