159   int. fbi office - outside the o'ryan room - morning        159

      6 a.m. fran pauses outside the o'ryan room... where mackelway
      sleeps on a chair. poor guy was here all night.

      she regards him... then her eyes find that map, and the gaping
      black wave across it. a horrible image...

      she studies mackelway again, almost tenderly, until:

                           charlton (o.s.)
                 does he listen to you?

      she turns, startled. here's charlton, right behind her. and
      she's been caught... watching mackelway sleep.

                           fran
                 i'm sorry?

                           charlton
                 it's not a strength of his. i'm noticing
                 that lately.

      truth is, she doesn't like charlton. or trust him...

                           fran
                 he's fine.

                           charlton
                 i'm not so sure.
                     (a beat)
                 you oughtta sit him down, remind him how
                 a chain-of-command works.

                           fran
                 he's fine, sir.

                                                               84.


                           charlton
                 talk to him.

      with that, he's gone. fran watches as he heads for the front
      door... and exits.

      she looks back to mackelway. he awakens with a start. thinking
      no one's watching, he pops another vicoden.
