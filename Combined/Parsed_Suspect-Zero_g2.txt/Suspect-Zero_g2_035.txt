35   int. courthouse - hallway - resuming flashback                    35

     mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped.

     the hall's busy with media and other traffic. first face he
     sees is fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring on). her eyes
     say how lousy she feels for him. it almost helps.
