188   ext. ranch-house - greenville, texas - continuing                   188

      we've seen this place before. that is, we've seen it in
      o'ryan's drawing, which lies on the dashboard before us: a
      ranch-style house with a windmill in the backyard.

      o'ryan pulls over. rain pounds on the roof and hood. wind
      blows. mackelway studies the house. then his eyes shift
      briefly to the drawing.

                           mackelway
                 can't bring you in with me. you know
                 that.

      o'ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "cuff me."

      the cuffs are lying on the floor in the back seat. mackelway
      reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for o'ryan
      to club the guy.

      but o'ryan remains still. mackelway grabs them. then he stops.
      simply has to ask:

                           mackelway (cont'd)
                 those faxes, the have-you-seen-me's...
                 how many of 'em is he actually
                 responsible for?

      o'ryan lays it right out:

                           o'ryan
                 all of 'em.

      mackelway nods, sobered. cuffs o'ryan to the steering wheel
      and approaches the house.

                                                                 110.
