69   int. baptist church - day                                         69

     a lively sunday service. lots of baptists, singing a rousing
     spiritual. music and praise filling the room.

     we move along the pews, until we came to the very back row...
     there, one man sits. alone. quiet. o'ryan.

     odd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this
     rousing music, or feel the power of this place. people in the
     next row are stomping their feet. music soars.

     but o'ryan just drops his head, slowly... and begins to weep
     in the middle of this boisterous congregation.

     outside, an 18-wheel truck can be heard, rumbling by with
     great force. no one else in here seems to hear it.

     but o'ryan shuts his eyes tight, grieving, sobbing...
