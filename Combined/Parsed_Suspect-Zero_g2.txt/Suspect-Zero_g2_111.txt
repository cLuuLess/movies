113   int. stolen car - driving - moments later (dusk)                  113

      the radio is blasting - anything to shake those images out of
      his head. driving, unsettled... which may be why he doesn't
      notice that there's a siren wailing behind him.

      he looks in the rear-view. a texas state trooper is on his
      tail. shit. o'ryan tightens, pulling over...
