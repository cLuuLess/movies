167   intercut with/int. fran's car - driving - same                   167

      she's driving, talking into the cel...

                           fran (into phone)
                 what're you doing?

                           mackelway
                 surveilling. what're you doing?

                           fran
                 driving to greenville.

                           mackelway
                     (knows already)
                 why would you be doing that?

                           fran
                 i think agents are safer when they have
                 some company. i can send along katie if
                 you'd rather.

      mackelway laughs. he appreciates a good jab.

                           mackelway
                 i'm at the truck-stop we traced. off the
                 i-30.

                           fran
                 i'm 'bout a half hour out.

                           mackelway
                 i'll order some lunch for you. hear the
                 meatloaf's good today.

      she half-smiles. she likes him, despite herself.

                                                                 92.


168   diner - mackelway - resuming                                     168

      he half-smiles, puts the cel-phone away. he likes her, despite
      himself.

      then a man passes by him, a trucker. let's call him vic.

      all we see as he passes is the tattoo on his forearm: a cobra.
      keys jingle on his belt-hook. he wears a sleeveless down vest
      and a "god bless america" cap.

      mackelway turns, but vic's already past us.

      something about him attracts mackelway's attention. the walk,
      the attitude. something.

      so mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as vic
      crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. it's a beast.
      vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched.

      mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to
      distract him. that waitress comes by with more coffee.
      mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again.

      and sees a little boy of 5, in the cab of vic's rig...

      but this little boy is screaming, struggling to get out of his
      car-seat, until vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly...
      all of this visible through the windshield.

      mackelway locks in on the kid. holy shit...

      vic's rig pulls out. the kid pounds on his window. looks like
      he's saying "lemme out of here! i want my mommy!" he might be
      little charlie - we can't tell from here.

      but we can see that vic is yelling at him: "shut up!"

      and we can see that vic's truck is refrigerated. he's hauling
      dairy products.

      on a normal day, mackelway might shrug this off as
      coincidence. he might not be so vigilant.

      this isn't a normal day. he races for the door.
