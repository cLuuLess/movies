52   ext. woods outside sleeper, mo. - later                           52

     law enforcement vehicles surround the site. cops, grieves,
     coroner's guys taking pictures. loretta is sitting on the back
     of an ambulance, being tended to.

     a composite artist sits beside her, trying.

                          loretta
                i don't think the eyes are right.

                                                          36.


                       composite artist
           narrower?

                     loretta
           no, they were... i don't really know.

composite artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look
anything like the face of o'ryan.

charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing.

a missouri highway patrol car pulls up. mackelway steps out of
it. we follow him as he takes in the scene.

a flashbulb illuminates starkey's chest; is got a zero-with-
a-slash-through-it. but mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face
yet.

                       mackelway
           sir?
               (charlton turns)
           we got an i.d. yet?

                     charlton
           mmm-hmm.
               (mackelway waits)
           might wanna find yourself a fender.
           you're gonna need to sit down.
               (mackelway's still waiting)
           it's virgil ray starkey.

mackelway pales.

we stay on him for a moment as it registers. the man he
caught, and then lost, has killed again. no. god, no.

                     mackelway
               (struggling for composure:)
           starkey did this?
                     charlton
           no. starkey's the one on the ground.

mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. but he turns
toward the face, as another flashbulb illuminates it, searing
the image into the darkness. starkey. dead. his eyelids ripped
away.

mackelway stares, stunned. can't fucking believe it.

                     mackelway
               (breathless)
           my god...

                                                                  37.


     it's like looking at a ghost - a spectre that's been haunting
     him, dead now... mackelway pulls out his minox, starts
     photographing, moving in on those lidless eyes...

                          grieves
                gonna make a wallet-size of that one?

                          charlton
                give him a break, grieves.

     mackelway doesn't comment. just keeps snapping shots...

                                                        cut to:
