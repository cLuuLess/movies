130   int. inside the black wave - undetermined time                    130

      somehow, we've submerged into the wave itself. a black, tidal
      force of nature.

      and it is moving. alive. we hear the sounds of it: a sucking,
      a yawning, as if a tide were drawing back just before
      exploding forward.

      the sounds blend in with the wind, the rain, the drops in that
      bucket... evil itself, on the move, gathering might. and we're
      along for the ride...

      the wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon.
      it is massive, powerful, dark. and we're right on its forward
      edge, as if surfing it somehow.
