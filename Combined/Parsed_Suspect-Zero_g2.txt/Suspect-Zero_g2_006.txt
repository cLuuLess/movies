6   int. wichita falls f.b.i. office - later                          6

    a brief montage: mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as those
    other agents take calls, strap on guns, head out on
    assignment. men in motion.

                                                                 8.


    but mackelway's land-locked, writing up an auto-theft report.
    it's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word
    "beige" and replacing it with "tan."

    his head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him.
    but after lingering for a half-second on that "most-wanted
    list" again? starkey? it's a wound...
