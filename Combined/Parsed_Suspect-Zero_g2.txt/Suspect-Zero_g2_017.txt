17   int. mackelway's yukon - parking lot - gainesville 10:30 p.m. 17

     mackelway sits behind the wheel of his chevy yukon, parked
     between two big-rigs in the lot of the "all-american diner."
     sky looks black tonight. it rumbles...

     and that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw... it was all
     his.

     he pulls four more bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket.
     slugs them down. this headache is a constant. then he gets out
     of the yukon...
