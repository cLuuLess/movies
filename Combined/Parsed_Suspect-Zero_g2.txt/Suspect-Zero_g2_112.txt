114   int./ext. stolen car - roadside - continuing                      114

      the trooper approaches, noting the condition of the vehicle.
      he stands before o'ryan's window. o'ryan's face reveals no
      evidence at all of anxiety.

                            trooper
                 evening.

                           o'ryan
                 evening, officer.

                           trooper
                 see your license, sir?

                           o'ryan
                 'course. is there a problem?

      o'ryan reaches into his back pocket, produces an i.d. hands it
      over.

      trooper eyes it. according to this i.d., we are now staring at
      "james garvey" from littleton, colorado. but the trooper
      doesn't seem too convinced.

                           trooper
                 see your registration, please?

                            o'ryan
                 sure.

      o'ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching
      through it. but it's a stall, that's obvious.

                           trooper
                 mind stepping out of the car, please?

      o'ryan pauses. there is no way in hell he's going to let
      himself get deterred by a state trooper. but he gets out.
