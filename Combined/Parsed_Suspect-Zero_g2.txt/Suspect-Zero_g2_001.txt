1   ext. ditch - off the interstate - 4:30 a.m.                      1

    amongst the refuse is a discarded milk carton, resting on its
    back. the carton asks "have you seen me?" above a photographed
    face that's been obscured by grime.

    yellowing newspaper, old coke cans, twinkie wrappers... in
    that bed of untended weeds. a hollow texas wind blows through
    it all. we stay with the carton...

    then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep rumble grows
    in the distance, becoming a roar. the yellowed newspaper lifts
    off and whips past us.

    ...as an 18-wheel mack truck blows by, just a blur in the
    corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness.

    then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. the
    milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed.

    a light rain begins to fall... and some of the grime washes
    away from that milk carton, revealing a face. a child. "have
    you seen me?" it's heartbreaking.
    tilt up... to take in the vast flatness of texas' i-35:
    concrete forever. in the distance, gray highway yields to
    black stormclouds gathering silently over endless prairie.

    a vertical vein of lightning streaks through one of them.

                                                     cut to:

    ...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee.

                                                                 2.
