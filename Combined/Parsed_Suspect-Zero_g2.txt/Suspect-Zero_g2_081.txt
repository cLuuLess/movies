     now there are 800 yellow pins stuck in this map - one for
     every single fax or letter that's been received in the past

     800 faces. 800 have you seen me's, represented by 800 pins in
     800 cities. it's like a national plague.

     in his pocket now is a bottle of prescription pills. percodan.
     he slugs one down without water, his eyes never straying from
     that map.

     mackelway's description. it's dead-on...
