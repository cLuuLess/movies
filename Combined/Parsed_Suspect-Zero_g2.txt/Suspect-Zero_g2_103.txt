105   ext. wichita falls fbi office - parking lot - night              105

      mackelway exits the office, heading for his yukon.

      then he stops... because katie is waiting out here, leaning
      against her toyota camry.

                           mackelway
                     (fondly)
                 hey.

                           katie
                 somethin', huh? guy with a wife and kids
                 keepin' bodies in his attic?

      he nods... but what is she doing out here?

                           mackelway
                 yeah.
                     (a beat)
                 you okay?

                           katie
                 yeah. just... wondered if you could do me
                 a favor.

                                                                  64.


      mackelway waits... as katie hands over a manila envelope.
      mackelway opens it.

      inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl
      named karen sumpter, with an attached sheet listing her
      vitals: height, weight, age, etc.

      another face. another disappearance...

                            katie (cont'd)
                 her name's karen sumpter. we were
                 friends.
                     (almost reluctantly)
                 she disappeared last year. nobody knows
                 where. she was a little wild, but not
                 like that.

      her sadness is obvious. mackelway nods.

                           katie (cont'd)
                 anyway, i know you're gonna be in on the
                 autopsies - of the girls they found over
                 at speck's. figured you might see if one
                 of 'em was...

      her voice trails off. this is hard.

                           katie (cont'd)
                 if it is, i'd like to be the one to
                 notify her folks. out families've been
                 friends for years.

                           mackelway
                     (gently)
                 sure. of course.

                           katie
                 thanks... 'night.

      mackelway puts the envelope under his arm. she starts up the
      camry. the sky rumbles. he eyes her.

      for some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet...

                                                 smash cut to:
