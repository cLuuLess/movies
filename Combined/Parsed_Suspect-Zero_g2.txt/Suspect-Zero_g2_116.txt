119   intercut with/int. fran's car - same                           119

      we're in a parking lot outside a wal-mart. fran's just thrown
      a bag into her ford taurus. her cel-phone rings. she grabs it.

                           fran (into cel)
                 kulok.

                           mackelway (into phone)
                 he really was fbi.

                           fran
                 huh?

                           mackelway
                 o'ryan. he left his file on my doorstep.
                 fran, he was fbi.

      he can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what
      was in that file now; pages are splayed across mackelway's
      coffee table:

      a copy of an fbi i.d. badge, xeroxed memoes, test scores,
      citations, evaluations, reports. the entire career of special
      agent benjamin o'ryan... in black and white.

                          fran
                that's impossible.

                          mackelway
                i'm look at his whole history!
                citations, letters of commendation, even
                his fucking test scores from quantico.
                the guy was an agent.

                          fran
                i don't believe it.

                          mackelway
                listen to me--

                                                         70.


then we hear a beep. call-waiting. great.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           shit! hold on.

that irritated her. mackelway clicks over.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           yes?

                     o'ryan (thru phone)
           read anything interesting lately?

mackelway's eyes go wide.

                     mackelway
           where are you?

click. o'ryan's just hung up.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           shit!

he stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting
to fran.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           that was him.

                     fran
           he called you at home?

                     mackelway
           yes.

beep. call-waiting again.

                     fran
           jesus. call me back.

mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.

                     mackelway (into phone)
           o'ryan?

                     o'ryan (thru phone)
           i've found him, you know.

                     mackelway
           who?

                     o'ryan
           zero.

                                                          71.


                     mackelway
           zero's a myth. you made him up.

                     o'ryan
           myths don't kidnap little boys. do they?

                     mackelway
           do you?

sounds like o'ryan just laughed... then, another curve:

                     o'ryan
           was she pretty?

                     mackelway
           huh?

                     o'ryan
           i could hear her moaning, right under the
           navajo chanting. whole thing was
           downright tribal. what's she look like?

that was unsettling. very. mackelway looks around feeling
violated, feeling "watched." he draws the blinds. double bolts
the front door. runs his hand under the window frame for any
kind of wire tapping.

but mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. not now, with
o'ryan on the phone.

                     mackelway
               (calmly)
           you tell me.

o'ryan laughs. he liked that.

                     o'ryan
           fair enough. we'll stick to business:
           how'd ya like my old room?

                     mackelway
           huh?

                     o'ryan
           "hope house." you were there.

how the hell did he know that? it's unsettling.

                     o'ryan (cont'd)
           dyson re-paint it?
               (no reply)
           my room. did he re-paint it?

                                                                  72.

                           mackelway
                 yeah. white.

                           o'ryan
                 ...but you saw what was underneath, of
                 course.

                           mackelway
                 no. tell me about it.

                           o'ryan
                 no. you tell me.

      click. o'ryan just hung up. mackelway stares at the phone.

                                                        cut to:
