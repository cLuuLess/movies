88   int. hotel hallway - 5 a.m.                                       88

     mackelway stands outside room 217 at a mariott. he's just
     knocked on the door.

     fran opens it, in a robe. very confused. he looks manic.

                          fran
                what're you--

                          mackelway
                i can't get a read on this guy.

     two minutes ago, she was sound asleep.

                          fran
                huh?

                          mackelway
                why is he sending us all this shit? i've
                got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing
                people. what's he telling us?

     she gets it now: he's on a combination of painkillers and lack
     of sleep. or maybe she can sense where he's been...

                                                       54.


                     mackelway (cont'd)
               (rapid-fire)
           he kills a travelling salesman, then a
           school-teacher. then starkey? it doesn't
           connect.

                     fran
           you're a mess...

                     mackelway
           i'm fine. i'm clear. i just didn't think
           this could wait. fran, this guy is trying
           to point us at something. starkey's part
           of it. but the other two don't connect.

                     fran
           did you drive here?

                     mackelway
           i'm fine! i just need somebody to think
           this through with me! he wanted to meet
           me. it's like he was interviewing me
           somehow. what is that? then he kills
           starkey. so what was he doing with speck
           and fulcher?

                     fran
           you wanna come in?

                     mackelway
           no. no. you come out. get dressed.

                     fran
           out where?

                     mackelway
           i dunno. somewhere. we're right on the
           edge of this thing.

she studies him. a long beat.

                     fran
           i'm going back to bed. you're welcome to
           the couch if you want. i think you could
           do with some sleep.

he sags a bit. she reaches for his hand.

                     fran (cont'd)
               (gently)
           mack...

                                                                  55.


     just like that, there is contact. their hands. it surprises
     them both.

     he appreciates it, but now's not the time. so he smiles
     thinly, turns, and goes.

     she watches him vanish around a corner.

                                                        cut to:
