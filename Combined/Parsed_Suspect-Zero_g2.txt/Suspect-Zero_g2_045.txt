46   ext. at loretta's car - moments later                             46

     it all happens pretty fast: that chip-clip hits the ground
     beside the open vw door. a battered pick-up speeds away,
     kicking up gravel.

                                                      cut to:

     ...loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread.
