     low-lights, dust on the floor. pool tables.

     loretta is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox,
     weighing her choices. she's got a thick curtain of hair, which
     she wrangles with a chip-clip. it's a habit.

     she chooses a country-rock tune, then heads for the bar,
     walking to the beat. it's fun being 19 and beautiful.

     the bartender's a stocky guy with a broad smile.

                          loretta
                    (re: song)
                how's that?

                          bartender
                little cute for my taste, but i can stand
                three minutes of it.

                          loretta
                i'll have a seven and seven, please.

                          bartender
                seven and seven. got some i.d.?

     she half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and
     throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re-
     fastening that chip-clip. it's her best move.

                          loretta
                it's in the car. no one's asked me for it
                for a couple years now.

                          bartender
                if ya hurry, you'll still catch the end
                of the song.

     she eyes him: are you really carding me? he smiles: nothing
     personal, sugar. so she heads for the door.

     ...on her way, she passes a booth. in it we find a familiar
     face - virgil ray starkey...

     he remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her. but behind
     his eyes, something primal just took place. he rises, heads
     for the door.

                                                                 33.
