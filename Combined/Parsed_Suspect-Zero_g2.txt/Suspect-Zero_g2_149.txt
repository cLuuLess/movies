154   int. fbi office - o'ryan room - later night                       154

      ten minutes have passed, but mackelway has seen a revelation.
      we can read it on his face.

      he eyes the map... which has now been stuck with over 1,000
      black pins, one for each city with a have you seen me to its
      credit.

      and those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we
      weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when
      the pins were yellow.

      looks like a big black wave. and that's just what it is.

      1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that
      o'ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave
      of darkness, gathering strength.

      but this black wave is consuming america...

      mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. the thing
      seems vast, unstoppable... a black wave - pure malevolence,
      covering the states like a fog.

      one blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart
      of greenville, texas. then, piercing the silence:

                           charlton (o.s.)
                 got one of those pins in denton yet?

      mackelway turns. charlton leans in the doorway.
                           charlton (cont'd)
                 o'ryan was spotted there tonight. took a
                 squad-car and a side-arm from a state
                 trooper. 'bout an hour later a five-year
                 old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up
                 the interstate.

      it's 3 a.m. what's this guy doing here?

                           charlton (cont'd)
                 the vehicle was found in an abandoned
                 lot. we're establishing a perimeter
                 around the city now.

                                                         79.

                     mackelway
               (knows already)
           but the trooper wasn't hurt...

                     charlton
           what makes you so sure?

                     mackelway
           professional courtesy.

charlton's at a loss... until mackelway gestures to the table,
where he has laid out o'ryan's entire fbi file. every memo,
citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.

charlton eyes it, calmly. he's not going to let his jaw drop,
not with mackelway watching. so he just nods.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           is that... possible, sir? an agent can
           just be deleted?

                     charlton
           looks like it.

 mackelway pauses. it's a depressing reality...

                     mackelway
           i couldn't understand it before - pushing
           speck's car onto the state line. makes
           sense now. he wanted to make the case
           federal. he's drawing us in.

                     charlton
           why would he do that?

                     mackelway
           so we'd be paying attention when he found
           suspect zero.

                     charlton
           ya know what? i'm getting extremely tired
           of hearing that word. in fact, that's
           gonna be policy from now on. no zero.
                     mackelway
           sir, profile the guy. he's straight outta
           quantico. all he's doing is working a
           case, like we would. he's not kidnapping
           little kids - he's chasing the guy who's
           doing the kidnapping! look at the map!

                                                       80.


                     charlton
           what're you saying - that all these
           abductions are the work of one guy? do
           you know how fucking insane that is?!
               (over mackelway)
           not let's try something that actually
           makes sense: he sends in these faxes,
           picks off three scumbags. for what?! so
           we'll think exactly what you're thinking
           right now - that we've got a friend out
           there, somebody willing to take out the
           garbage for the rest of us. and it's all
           horse-shit!

                     mackelway
           what if it isn't? what if there really is
           a zero out there and o'ryan's the one guy
           who's got a shot at him?

                     charlton
               (just blew his top)
           fuck's sake, mackelway - when did you
           start buying into this guy?!

a beat. mackelway lets the silence hover.

                     mackelway
               (quietly)
           he's smarter than we are.

                     charlton
           speak for yourself.

charlton heads for the door.

                      mackelway
           sir? what if i told you i knew how to
           catch him?

charlton stops. turns.

                     charlton
           do you?

                     mackelway
           and what if i told you that the way i'd
           catch him involved sitting in a dark
           room, with nothing in front of me but a
           pad of paper... until i'd tapped into
           some kind of... energy out there. the
           collective unconscious. something. if i
           told you i thought i could target and
                     (more)

                                                            81.


                     mackelway (cont'd)
           locate him, without ever leaving this
           building, what would you say?

                     charlton
           i'd say you'd watched too many "x-files."

                     mackelway
           y'ever heard of a project called
           "icarus," sir?

                     charlton
           no.

mackelway tosses over a few pages from o'ryan's file.

                     mackelway
           agents, trained to "see" distant
           locations using nothing but the mind.
           they called it remote viewing.

charlton eyes the pages without comment.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           army stole it from the soviets. the
           bureau stole it from the army - used it
           to track serial killers.
               (a beat)
           experimental program. o'ryan was the
           first agent they recruited.

                     charlton
           good for him.

                     mackelway
           voodoo, right? pure bullshit.
               (charlton's waiting)
           ...except, it worked. it's how he drew
           this:
mackelway's referring to that drawing: a steamer-trunk, filled
with ghastly ziploc bags:

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           he'd never been in that house before. he
           just saw what was in there - the bureau
           taught him how... same one that deleted
           him. same one that's trying to catch him
           now... does anything about all this
           strike you as odd?

charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... then:

                                                                  82.


                           charlton
                 i'm going to denton at oh-six-hundred.
                 you can take the day off.

      with that, he's gone - leaving mackelway alone in here.
      nothing to look at but that black wave... he hears charlton,
      leaving the building.

      he slams another vicoden, then hears a phone ring. fuck it.
      he's not moving. let voice mail get it.

      ...until he hears the sound of a fax coming in.

      he rises. follow him:
