91   int. speck's house - living room - moments later                   91

     mackelway sits at the window, looking over the backyard.
     nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm-cellar
     door.

     but he's staring at it, intently. we're not sure why.

                                                         56.


behind him, jan re-enters, purse over her shoulder, umbrella
in hand. she grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the
coffee table.

                     jan
           i'm sorry i don't have more time, agent
           mackelway. it's my pta day.

                     mackelway
           it's fine. i should've called.

she smiles tightly: "i have to go now" and heads for the
kitchen. once she's there, mackelway turns to the back door
and unlocks it, eyeing that storm-cellar outside...

she leaves the cup in the sink. he enters the kitchen.

                     jan
           i hope i was of some help.

                     mackelway
           you were. thanks.

                     jan
           a friend of mine said i'll feel like this
           one month for every year we were
           together. sort of a grieving rule-of-
           thumb. have you ever heard that?

                      mackelway
               (gently)
           no. sorry.

she half-smiles. he turns to the door. turns back.

                     mackelway (cont'd)
           oh. there was one other thing: did he
           keep any kind of chemicals around the
           house? acids, that sort of thing?

                      jan
           no. why?

he shrugs, dismissing it:

                     mackelway
           it's nothing. trace elements we found on
           his trunk. any interest in chemistry?
           maybe as a hobby?

jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory...
then she shakes it off. he lets it go.

                                                                  57.


                          mackelway (cont'd)
                anyway, thank you. and thanks for the
                coffee. next time i'll call first, i
                promise.

                          jan
                no trouble at all.

                                                        cut to:
