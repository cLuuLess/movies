86   int. katie's apt. - bathroom - later night                       86

     mackelway stands at the mirror, changing the dressing on that
     wound across his chest. he unwraps the gauze over that fat
     bandage soaked through with blood.

     he pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep
     gash. dried blood, torn skin, bruising. looks like hell. but
     mackelway eyes it calmly.

     he slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the
     wound with some hydrogen peroxide... as katie appears in the
     doorway. she eyes him.

                          katie
                can't sleep?

     he shrugs, turns.

                          mackelway
                what was that music?

                          katie
                it's navajo. a song for dead warriors. i
                never played it for anybody before.

                          katie (cont'd)
                    (a beat)
                just had a feeling you'd like it.

                          mackelway
                how?

                          katie
                i dunno. the way you stare when you think
                nobody's looking.

     she shrugs. silence hovers...
