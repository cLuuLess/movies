158   int. 18-wheeler - cab - moving - night                            158

      we've seen this truck before - several times in fact. it
      rumbles along the highway. we don't see who's driving, but we
      do see who's in the passenger seat:

                                                                 83.


      it's charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just
      witnessed. he sleeps fitfully.

      a man's hand can be seen, edging into frame - the driver. he
      picks up a cassete, shoves it into the tape deck.

      and out comes the sound of "barney the dinosaur."

                           barney (thru dashboard stereo)
                 oh silly songs get sillier/when you hear
                 them once again/and maybe you're hearing
                 an echo/or maybe it's only a friend!

      the truck continues to rumble along.

                                                       cut to:
