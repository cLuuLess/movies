      dolly and mel sit opposite mackelway and fran.

                           dolly
                 he was a quiet guy. normal. liked to read
                 fishing magazines. not much of a tipper.
                 is that a lousy thing to say?

                            fran
                 it's fine.

      mel rolls his eyes.

                           mackelway
                 what can you tell us about the other man?

                           mel
                 like i said, i never really saw him.
                 harold came up, complainin' about the guy
                 - but time i turned, he was gone.

                    fran                      mack
              (at dolly:)               (at dolly:)
          could you de--            did you get a--

     they each stop short, waiting for the other to yield. finally
     mackelway nods, "go ahead."

                           fran
                 can you describe him, ma'am?

                           dolly
                 sure. he was...

      dolly pauses, her face scrunching a bit. troubled...

                           dolly (cont'd)
                 that's weird. guy was in here better part
                 of an hour. we had a real pleasant
                 chat... but i can't remember a thing
                 about him. for the life of me. couldn't
                 even tell you what color his eyes were.

      she shrugs apologetically.

                                                                 20.


                          fran
                happen to see what he was driving?

                           dolly
                that one's easy. it's still in the lot.
                    (they perk up)
                the bonneville out there with the awful
                paint job.

     she gestures to the lot, where an old pontiac bonneville sits,
     its paint stripped down to the primer. bingo.

     fran and mackelway eye it, then one another.

                                                       cut to:
