85   int. katie's apartment - bedroom - later night                    85

     inexpensive, but furnished with all the touches that
     mackelway's apartment lacks: flea-market stuff, lace, antique
     books, photos from other eras. character.

     and candles. lots of candles. they throw shadows of mackelway
     and katie all over the walls.

     an odd music fills the room, coming from a boom-box on the
     floor. it's a rhythmic navajo chant, with native-american
     drums providing the pulse.

     it's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic... and it fits the
     intensity of the moment: mackelway and katie, coupling madly,
     their eyes locked. she's breathless.

                                                                52.


     first time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that
     furnace room. a fat bandage covers a quarter of his chest.
     dried blood can be seen beneath it.

     there's an intensity in his eyes. the chanting, the candles,
     katie's body, his wound... they've conspired to bring an
     intensity into his eyes. it's dark, primal.

     and he's been expressing it for an hour without relent...
     which is why katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge
     of the bed, exhausted.

     she reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume. the chanting
     dies down into silence. she catches her breath.

                          katie
                    (softly)
                i can't anymore.

     mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the
     volume on that boom-box back up. the chanting fills the room
     again.

     and just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently.
     that primal side hasn't been sated yet...

                                                      cut to:
