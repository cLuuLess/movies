      mackelway gets in, hits the ignition. reaches for his cel-
      phone. starts to dial.

                           o'ryan
                     (disappointed)
                 awfully conventional - don't ya think?

      mackelway pauses.

                           mackelway
                 huh?

                           o'ryan
                 apprehend the fugitive, then call it in
                 for your pat on the head.

                           mackelway
                 sorry to disappoint you.

      mackelway continues to dial.

                            o'ryan
                 i'll get over it.
                     (flat)
                 but i'm not too sure that little boy
                 will.

      bang. that just stopped mackelway, mid-dial.

                                                               97.


                           mackelway
                     (minor test)
                 what little boy?

                           o'ryan
                 the one from the diner, in denton.

                           mackelway
                 you know where he is?

                           o'ryan
                 i can find him.

                           mackelway
                 how?

                           o'ryan
                 same way i found starkey, and speck, and
                 fulcher... and you.

      that rang a bell.

                           o'ryan (cont'd)
                 i need someplace quiet - someplace i can
                 concentrate... and your assurance that
                 once he's located, we go get him
                 together.

                           mackelway
                 i can't do that.

                           o'ryan
                 then i can't help you.

      mackelway, disgusted, pulls out of the lot.
