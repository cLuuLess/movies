164   intercut with/int. morgue - same                                164

      fran is at a phone, in the morgue. the logan utah body lies on
      the table.

                           fran
                 it's not a burn. it's a freezer-burn.
                           mackelway
                 you're sure.

                           fran
                 there's crystallization in the blood
                 stream. the blood never clotted in the
                 wound. it's a freezer burn... i'm having
                 the other body shipped out - the guy from
                 trenton. we'll see if he's got the same
                 thing.

      mackelway pauses, thinking...

                                                                   90.


                           mackelway
                 so... he keeps the bodies in a freezer,
                 then buries them...?

      that was a question. he can't do any better.

                           fran
                 i dunno. if he kept them in a freezer
                 they'd have marks like this all over.
                 wouldn't they?

      mackelway nods - that made sense. shit.

      the noise of the interstate doesn't make things any easier. a
      huge truck rumbles by. 18 wheels.

      mackelway eyes it, absently. then a bolt hits him:

      on the side of the truck is a trademark: "ever-frost." this
      truck is hauling ice cream.

      things just began to click.

                           mackelway
                 thanks, fran.

      he has hit "end" before she can reply. heads to his yukon.

      fran eyes the phone: that was odd...

                                                         cut to:
