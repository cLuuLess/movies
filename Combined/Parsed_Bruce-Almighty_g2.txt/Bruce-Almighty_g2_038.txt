int. bruce and grace's apartment - bedroom - morning

bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. he gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. the same number.

                                                          32.



                    bruce
          well, hello again 772-5623, don't
          hold your breath.
bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
the beeper beeps. bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and fires it out. it shatters
against a telephone pole. he calmly continues to the
bathroom.
