int. bruce and grace's apartment - morning

bruce lies next to grace with a big smile on his face. grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to bruce.
                    grace
          sweety, time to get up...
she kisses bruce, gets up.
                    bruce
          no, i'm having a great dream.
the covers are ripped out of frame.   bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.
