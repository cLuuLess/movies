ext. parking lot - day
bruce carries his box to his car, when he hears a noise.
a street gang is hassling the homeless sign guy. pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
instinctively, bruce walks over.
                    bruce
          hey, come on guys. what are you
          doin'? just leave him alone.
they turn, look at bruce, laugh and head off.    bruce helps
the sign guy up, looks after the gang.
                    bruce
          yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
they stop cold, turn back to bruce and charge at him. bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. we
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. bruce slowly gets up.
reveal bruce's car, window's smashed, paint scraped and the
word "hero" key scratched on the door.
                    bruce
          b-e-a-utiful.
               (looks up)
                     (more)

                                                       28.

                    bruce (cont'd)
          just what you get for trying to
          help someone.
bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the
homeless man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign
"life is. just"
                    bruce
          get a clue, buddy.
