ext. warehouse - day
an old building on the outskirts of town. a faded sign
painted on the wall reads, omni presents.
bruce's demolished car enters frame.      he studies the area and
building suspiciously.
bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, steps
in a puddle. he sinks up to his knee.
                        bruce
             perfect.
he gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.
