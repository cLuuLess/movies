ext. parking lot - day
bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a homeless
man who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. the various "warnings" change daily. today's sign
reads:
                  r ewe blind?
bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
