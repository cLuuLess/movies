bruce sits watching a hockey game on tv. he follows the puck
intently with his eyes, as though controlling it's path.
goal, sabers! the crowd roars!
                                                 cut to:

                                                 cut to:
grace sits aside him, working on the photo album.
                         grace
              do you believe how they're playing?
                  (beat)
              oh, honey, would you hand me the
              scissors?
bruce diverts his attention, when the sabers screw up and the
crowd groans. bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the
puck and goal, sabers! the crowd roars!
