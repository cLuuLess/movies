a couple dozen kids playing at grace's self-starter business,
a one room day care center filled with children and toys.

                    grace
          martin, are you eating the glitter
          again?
on martin - an adorable hispanic boy
he shakes his head "no."

                       grace
          martin. open your mouth. abra su
          boca.

                     grace
          oh, you're not huh? well, then
          you've got a bad case of liberace.

outfit. her youngest, zoe, 3, runs over to greet her.

                       grace
          they didn't teach you spanish in
          nursing school, did they?
                       debbie
          well, it seemed like they were
          speaking a foreign language
          sometimes, but no. problemo?
                     grace
          martin has decided to explore new
          food groups.
               (back to martin)
          martin, this is for art. like this.
she spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.
                     debbie
          is it so wrong to tie them up?
                        grace
          d eb -- ma rt i n!
martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth.
grace snatches it.
                      grace
          okay, go rinse your mouth with
          water. lave su boca. go.
               (to debbie)
          i swear that kid is going to poop
          an ornament.
                     debbie
               (laughs)
          you're good with them, you know.
          you should have some of your own.
                     grace

                     debbie
          free milk cow.
                     grace
          debbie, don't call me that.
                     debbie
          if the moo fits.
the phone rings.
