ext. street - lake eerie - continuous
bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at
the beads in his hands. he begins to laugh maniacally.
he spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,
heaves the prayer beads into the lake. he looks heavenward,
challenging the infinite.
                    bruce
          okay, if that's the way you want
          it. the gloves are off, pal! let
          me see a little wrath! smite me oh
          mighty smiteri what, no pestilence
          no boils? come on, you got me on
          the ropes, don't you want to finish
          me off?! you're the one who should
          be fired! the only one around here
          not doing his job is you! what are
          we, you're little pet project? a
          hobby you tinker with now and
          again? answer me. answer me!!!
a beat of silence then bruce's beeper goes off. he cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.
                     bruce
           sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
           call you if i did.
bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it beeps again.
                                             cut to:
close on - an alarm clock

the beeping continues. we are in. . .
