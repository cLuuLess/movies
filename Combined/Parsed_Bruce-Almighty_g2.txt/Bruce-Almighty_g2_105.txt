int. upscale home - night
the party of parties is in order. the place is jam packed
with co-workers, fellow reporters, and various news contacts
everyone is in an ecstatic mood, many prayers having been
recently answered. we move through the party and hear
snippets of various conversations.

well on his way to plastered, takes a swig, then glances at

sam walks away, his tail between his legs.
bruce maneuvers down the hall dancing, high-fiving, drunkenly *
accepting the praise coming at him from all sides.              *
                     partiers
          there he is. . . the mani.. all
          hail our new anchor!i

                     partying sports guy
          hey bruce, who do you like in the
          game tonight?
                     bruce
          put your money on the sabers.
          coach prays a lot.
a french waiter approaches bruce.

                     french waiter
          ah, mr. nolan, we're running out of
          hors doerves. i'm afraid we under-
          ordered, sir. and the people are
          hungry.
                     bruce
          what do you have left?
the waiter holds up a small basket.
                     french waiter
          only three chips and two shrimp.
                     bruce
               (confident)
          just take it around.
the waiter gets a confused look.
                                            cut to:
chips overflowing, shrimp spilling out of baskets, hands
reaching gluttonously for the bounty.

the waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
partiers crowd around bruce, start to chant.

                                                          93.



                      crowd
          speech!   speech!!   speech!

bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.
                      bruce
          i ' d thank you all for coming, but
          the liquor is free so maybe you
          should thank me!
everyone laughs.

                     bruce
          and now let me tell you a story.
          there was a man who had two sons.
          the younger son took his
          inheritance and squandered his
          money on a life of lust and
          debauchery. i love that guy!!

everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.

bruce's big smile fades. he looks around the room, hoping to
spot grace. he grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --

he gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. he hangs up.

                       female voice (o.s.)
          hey there.

bruce turns, sees susan ortega, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.
                     susan
          hi br uce. what are you d oing out
          here all alone?
                     bruce
          oh, ah, i was calling grace.

                       susan
          yeah, i didn't see her in there. i
          love the new place, by the way. so
          how are you and grace doing?
                     bruce
          i don't know, we had a fight
          earlier. ever since i . . well,

                                                           94.



                     susan
          you're on fire bruce. some women
          can't handle fire. some can.
susan smooths close to bruce.
                     susan
          you know, i always had an instinct
          about you. i knew you were going
          to make something of yourself.
                     bruce
          really?
                     susan
          there's something special about you
          bruce. i like special...
                    bruce
          look susan, i don't know, i--
susan grabs bruce, kisses him passionately. bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.

grace and debbie enter.

                     debbie
          so this is your new place, huh?
                     grace
          cozy, don't you think? come on
          help me find him.
they head into the room.
                     debbie
          you sure you want to do this?
                     grace
          i don't know. it's his big night.                      *

          so much for lashing back...
grace stops dead in her tracks. her face drops.
grace's pov - bruce, still lip-locked with susan ortega.

                                                       95.



                     debbie
          oh, boy.

bruce turns and sees grace.
                     bruce
          grace, i...
                     grace
             . (fighting back tears)

grace follows debbie out.
