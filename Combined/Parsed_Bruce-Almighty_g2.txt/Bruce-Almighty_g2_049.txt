ext. lake erie - day

god leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
god and bruce then walk along the lake shore.
                     god
               (re: the cockroach)
          most people want to kill these
          guys. i'm quite fond of em'. very
          streamlined design. like little
          armored tanks. y'know, they can
          hold their breath for forty minutes
          and their cells divide only once
          per molting cycle creating a
          cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
          that...
               (catching himself)
          oh, this is a bit over your head,
          isn't it?
off bruce's look.

                                                        44.



                    god
          okay, let me explain the rules.
                     bruce
          rules ?
                    god
          yeah, you left in such a rush i
          didn't get a chance to explain.
                    bruce
          well the two extra fingers freaked
          me out a little bit.
                     god
               (laughs)
          i figured that would get your
          attention.. i did the same thing to
          ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
          weeks. now, here's the deal. you
          have all my power. use it any way
          you choose. there are only two
          rules. you can't tell anyone
          you're god. believe me you don't
          want that kind of attention. and
          you can't mess with free will.
                     bruce
          uh huh.   can i-ask why?
                    god
              (excited)
          yes you can. that's the beauty it.
suddenly a large sailboat sail passes right by them.   bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
wide angle - reveal god and bruce are now walking on the lake
about 100 feet from the shore. they watch the sailboat pass.
bruce is awestruck.
                     bruce
          this is amazing.
                     god
          oh, speaking of amazing...
god dips his hand in the lake and pulls out the prayer beads.
he pockets them as he talks.

                                                         45.



                     god
           since you're finished with these, i
           think i'll hang to 'em. might come
           in handy someday.

god and bruce are tiny figures on the river, as god begins to
walk away.
                     god
           i'll be seein' ya.
                     bruce
           where are you going?
                     god
           i'm taking a vacation.
                     bruce
           god can't take a vacation. can he?
           can you?
                     god
           ever hear of the dark ages?
           besides, i'm covered. you can fix
           everything in five minutes if you
           want to, right?
on bruce
                       bruce
           ...right.
left alone, bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.
