int. omni presents - day
bruce enters and checks the building directory.      it reads:
omni presents unltd.

pers onnel    rm. 7
ac coun ting rm. 7
security      rm . 7
creativ e     rm. 7
                       voice (o.s.)
             you're looking for room 7.
bruce turns to see a janitor mopping the floor.     he looks at
bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
                       janitor
             want me to even those up for you?

                                                            34.


                     bruce
               (feigns a smile)
          how would i get to room 7?
                     janitor
          that'd be on the seventh floor.
          stairs are right over there.
                     bruce
          what about the elevator?
he points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
                     janitor
          out of order.
bruce heads for the stairs.
                     janitor
          you mind giving me a hand with this
          floor?
                    bruce
          what? yeah, i mind.
he continues on.

seventh floor

the stairwell door opens up to a large room with a single
desk at the end of an otherwise empty space.
bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.
                     bruce
          excuse me. hello. i'm, ah,
          looking for whoever runs this
          joint...
                     man (o.s.)
          be right with y.a, just fixin' a
          light. tell me if it's working?
click and an insanely bright white light illuminates, shining
down blinding bruce.

                     bruce
          yep, seems to be.
               (wiping his eyes)
          kinda bright, though.

                                                         35.



an electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.
                    man (o.s.)
          yeah, it is for most people. they
          spend their lives in the dark...
as he talks he steps down next to bruce and we see that it is
the same janitor.
                      janitor (cont'd)
          . . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
the two stand, angelically illuminated.    bruce tries to put
everything together.
                    bruce
          oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
                    janitor
          yeah, but i'll get around to it.
the janitor claps his hands twice and the light goes off.
                    bruce
          you installed a clapper?
                     janitor
          nope.   catchy jingle, though.
              (sings)
          clap on. clap off.    clap on, clap
          off. the clapper.
               (claps twice)
          you can't get it out of your head.
                    bruce
          i gotta go.
                    janitor
          okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
the janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
he extends his hand to bruce.
                    janitor
          you must be bruce. i've been
          expecting you.
                    bruce
          oh, this is hilarious. so you're
          the boss and the electrician and
          the janitor.

                                                         36.



                     janitor
          nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
          sleeves, son. people underestimate
          the benefits of good 'ol manual
          labor. there's freedom in it.
          happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day.
he strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
                     janitor
          your father knew that. he was a
          damn good welder.
bruce approaches the desk.
                     bruce
          how do you know my father? and how
          did you get my pager number?
                     janitor
          oh, i know a lot about you bruce.
          pretty much everything there is to
          know. everything you've ever said,
          done or thought about doin', is
          right there in that file cabinet.
he points out a single drawer file cabinet.
                     bruce
               (sarcastic)
          wow, a whole drawer. just for me?
          mind if i take a look?
                     janitor
          it's your life.
bruce pulls the drawer and it flies open, dragging him the
full length of the room --
the janitor casually pulls a file.
                     janitor
          now this last entry was a little
          disturbing.
he thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, dragging bruce back. the janitor
reads from the file.
                     janitor
               (reads, scanning)
          thanks for everything, lord.
                     (more)

                                                         37.

                      janitor (cont'd)
          i am so honored that my horrible
          demise is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.. the gloves are
          off, pal.. smite me oh mighty
          smiter.
               (aside)
          i'm not much for blaspheming but
          that one made me laugh. oh, and
          let's not forget "what kind of a
          god would let this happen? i mean,
          have you seen then news lately?"
bruce stands, dazed. ·
                     bruce
          who are you?
                     janitor
          i'm the creator of the heavens and
          the earth. i'm the alpha & omega.
          the first and the last.
                     bruce
          sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
                     janitor/god
          i'm god, bruce.
                     bruce
          oh, you're god. well that explains
          everything1 that's how you know
          everything about me. that's how
          you got up to the seventh floor so
          quickly.
               (placating)
          well, it's really nice to meet you.
          thanks for the grand canyon and,
          ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
bruce turns to leave, but finds himself walking right toward
god and his desk. he tries again, and again.
                     bruce
          okay, i don't know how you're doing
          that, but i really gotta go. this
          place is obviously rigged in some
          way. we're on some freaky hidden
          camera show.
               (playing to the "cameras")
          ...for which i will not sign a
          release, by the way! but you know
          what, i'd be a little more
          impressed if you didn't use the
          cheesy file cabinet illusion.
                     (more)

                                                               38.

                        bruce      (cont'd)
              everyone with a      brain in their head
              would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind--
    bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
    normal back.
                           bruce
              okay.     that's good.   that's a good
              one.
    bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
                        bruce
              okay, god. how many fingers am i
              holding out?
    bruce extends three fingers.
                           god
              three.
    he quickly pulls one finger in.
                           god
              two.
    bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      god doesn't miss a
    beat.
                        god
              four. nine. six. eight. one...
    one final attempt, bruce holds seven fingers.
                        bruce
              okay, how about now.
    he quickly pulls in two fingers.
                           god
              seven.

                          .bruce
              ah hal
    bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
    fingers to god, then immediately notices he has seven fingers
    on his one hand.

                          bruce
              aaahhhl

                                                             39,



he shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. god approaches bruce.
                    god
          you've been doing a lot of
          complaining about me, bruce. and
          quite frankly, i'm tired of it...
bruce backs away from god.
                    bruce
          you stay away from me! i don't
          know what your doing. but whatever
          you're doing is probably
          actionable!
                    god
          well, that's not very neighborly.
          i brought you here to offer you a
          job.
                    bruce
          job? wh at job?
                     god
          my job. you think you can do it
          better, so here's your chance.
          when you leave this building you
          will be endowed with all my powers.
                    bruce
          sure, whatever you say, pal.
he turns to go but god stands before him in the janitor
uniform, holding the mop.
                     god
          all the power of god.
bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
god the janitor has also vanished. a beat, then bruce
sprints out of the room.
