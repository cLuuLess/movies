          bruce, is there something you're
          not telling me?

                                                            52.


                    bruce
          nothing of this world. why?
                    grace
          what do you mean, why? last night
          you weren't exactly happy with
          life.
                    bruce
          last night, i was only human.
bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.
