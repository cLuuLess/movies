          first off, "i want to add another
          congratulations to evan baxter.
          it's good to see what someone with
          real talent can accomplish when
          great opportunities are given to
          him instead of me.
               (still smiling)
          anyway, i'm here, i believe with
          katherine hepburn's mom. tell me,
          why did you toss the blue "heart of
          the ocean" jewel over the railing
          of titanic?
the old woman doesn't know what to say.
                    bruce
          did you feel guilty at all letting
          leonardo decaprio freeze, while you
          were safe floating on the big door?
          do you think he would have survived
          if you had taken turns, or were you
          too afraid to freeze your big fat
          ass off?
