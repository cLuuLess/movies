                     jack
          the world's gone mad.
jack clicks off the monitor. bruce hustles in from make-up.
an air of forced confidence about him. nothing and no one is
going to ruin his big moment.
                     jack
          oh, there you are. your big debut.

                     bruce
          you know what? i'm good. the show
          must go on.
bruce sits in the anchor desk, breathes in the reality.
                     susan
               (whispers)
          bruce, if i had any idea grace was
          going to be there last night...
                     bruce
          susan, you didn't do anything                          *
          wrong. in fact, i found the                            *
          moment rather pleasurable.                             *
susan shudders, tries to compose himself.
                      susan
               (flustered)
          oh, really. . . that's nice.
                     jack
          okay, the sabers just won the
          stanley cup. it's getting pretty
          crazy out there. we're going to
          kick live to fred at the stadium.
          oh, and bruce, you won the pool
          again. exact score, dead on.
          twenty-three to one, who would have
          thought.

                                                               103.

              this is it, you good?
    bruce nods, straightens in his chair, prepares for his dream
    on the monitor
    the eyewitness news opening plays, then fades away to bruce
    and susan.
                        susan
              i'm susan ortega.
                         bruce

              m ak i n g n e ws --
    and the screen goes to static. lights dim in the studio.
                         jack
              what happened? what the hell
              happened?
    the stage manager listens to his wire.
                         stage manager
              we lost the signal. it's another
              power surge.
                         jack
              aw, geez. ever since that damn
              asteroid hit.
    the power comes back up.
                         stage manager
              we're back.

                         susan
              we apologize for the interruption,
              and now back to the news. bruce. . .
                        bruce
              thank you, susan--
    susan gets a feed in her earpiece.

                                                         104.
