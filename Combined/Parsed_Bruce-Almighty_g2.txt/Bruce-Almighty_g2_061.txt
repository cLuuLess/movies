int. bedroom - morning
bruce lies blissfully asleep. big smile, life is good.
then, we hear whispering - like distant voices murmuring all
at once. bruce wakes with a start. he looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.
angle - sam
circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. bruce casually
warns.
                    bruce
          sam. uh uh uh.

                                                         55.



sam looks at bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and stands up on his
two hind legs, holding his snausage with his front paws (no,
we don't see it) and starts to go.   he looks proudly back at
bruce.

                      bruce
          good boy.
