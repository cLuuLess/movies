ext. news station - day
as bruce pulls up in front of the building the no parking
sign flies back into the bushes and the red curb transforms
to green as though being sloppily painted with invisible
brushes.
bruce exits the car and smooths past the homeless sign guy,
who sits in his usual spot. his sign reads:
"heaven is at hand.   leggo your eggo."
