int. diner - day
bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. the only other
patron is an old man seated at the counter.
                    bruce
          it isn't real, it isn't real, it
          isn't real...
an older. sally kirkland-type waitress, order pad in hand,
stands listening to bruce with a raised eyebrow.
                    bruce
          oh hi, ah, coffee please.
the waitress pours him a cup.

                                                         42.



                    waitress
          we've got a special on soup today.

                    bruce
          no, that's okay.
                    waitress
          it's tomato.
                    bruce
          alright, okay.
she heads off.    bruce sits thinking.   could it be real?
he looks at the sugar down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the sugar slides across the table right into his
hand. the creamer slides into his other hand.
bruce is half scared, half thrilled. he pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
                    bruce
          excuse me i need a spoooo...
bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.
                     bruce
          that's alright, i found one.
the old man eyes bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
the waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
                     waitress
          i lie to my sister.
                     bruce
          what?
                     waitress
               (becoming emotional)
          and i'm sleeping with my best
          friend's husband. i know he's just
          using me but.. i'm just so tired of
          being alone. i don't know why i'm
          telling you all this. just seems
          like you'd understand.
                     bruce
          okay.

                                                       43.



                     waitress
               (sets the check down)
          take care of that whenever you're
          ready.
bruce looks at the soup. his look grows intense.   he slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....
music up: the ten commandments theme

the front door blows open, as a wind swirls through the diner
and with all the flourish of moses at the red sea, bruce
parts his red soup.
a little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
                    god (o.s.)
          havin' fun?
bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. he looks up at god standing
beside the booth. bruce is now awestruck.
                    bruce
          you- he- thy...
                    god
          let's take a walk.
