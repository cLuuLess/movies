ext. upscale home - night
bruce follows grace outside.
                    bruce
          grace, come on.
grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in bruce's chest.
                     grace
          here. i do n't w ant your car. i
          don't want your things. . . i don't
          want you.
                     bruce
          come on, don't say that. i was
          just calling y ou--
                     grace
          and you thought susan's mouth was
          the phone?
                    bruce
         i didn't think you were coming-- i
         mean, i . . . i screwed up, okay.
         let me make it up to you.
                    grace
          how about a boat, bruce?

                    bruce
          if that's what you want.

                                                        96.



                     grace
          yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
          bags of cash, you know, the ones
          with the big cartoon dollar signs
          on the front. then i'll be happy.
          because i'm just hollow inside.
          debbie's been right. all this
          time. i defended you, told her
          there was good in you. another
          side to you. well, i just saw that
          other side and i don't want
          anything to do with it.
debbie pulls up, grace storms off to the car. bruce follows,
                     bruce
          grace, come on, don't do this.
                     grace
          go back to your little co-anchor.
          or is that ho-anchor?
               (tearing)
          i came back here to apologize. how
          stupid am i?
grace turns and heads to the car.
                     bruce
          you're the one that didn't like the
          new place!
grace gets in, slams the door.
                    bruce
          you can't walk out on me! i'm the
          alpha, lady! i'm the omega!
debbie peels out.
                     bruce
               (desperate last attempt)
          i could make you stay!
bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.
                    bruce
          fine! i don't need you! i have
          everything i need. did you hear
          that?!
               (yelling)
          i have everything!

                                                      97.
