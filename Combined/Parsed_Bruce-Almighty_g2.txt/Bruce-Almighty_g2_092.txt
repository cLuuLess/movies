int. high school gym - rope climbing drill - day

a bully taunts a fat kid with horn rimmed glasses.

angle bruce - watching from the bleachers.

the fat kid nervously grabs the rope and much to his               *
surprise, he climbs it like stallone in cliff hanger.          *
bruce is in the stands, pleased. he flicks his finger upward
and the bully's gym shorts shoot up his butt crack - a
supernatural wedgy.
filbert flexes his flabby arm, amazed.
