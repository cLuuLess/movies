          no. guess again?                                        *
grace turns to bruce confused.
                     bruce
          it's mine...ours.

                                                88.



                       grace
          what?
                    bruce
              (beaming)
          this is our new home.    come on...
bruce pulls grace up the stairs.
                    grace
          this had to cost-- i can't even
          imagine how much this had to cost.
                    bruce
          7 million. that was the asking,
          but i got a deal.
                     grace
          wh-what am i missing here? you
          can't afford this. you're a
          reporter. buying cars is one
          t hing, but this--
bruce grabs a hold of grace.
                    bruce
          we'll have the money. listen to me
          closely. i'm getting anchor.
          then, i'm going to get spotted,
          offers will come flooding in to go
          national, and then you and i are
          moving to new york city to a place
          that will put this to shame. this
          has been my exact dream my whole
          life and it's finally going to
          happen. every step just how i
          pictured it.

grace just stares at bruce.
                    grace
          there's only one problem.
                       bruce
          what?
                       grace
          i hate it.
bruce is surprised.

                                          89.



          grace
what were you thinking? why didn't              *
you talk to me about this?                      *
          bruce                                 *
i wanted to surprise you.                       *
          grace                                 *
mission accomplished.                           *
          bruce
honestly, i thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.
          grace
appreciative of what? the fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the sultan of bernai's                  *
house?                                          *
            bruce
     (under his breath)
like pearls to swine.
          grace
what is that supposed to mean?
          bruce
let those with ears hear.
          grace
what is happening to you? you're
changing.

            bruce
exa ct ly. f or th e bet te r. i' m not
poor and s truggling . and mayb e
that threatens you. i'm telling
you, there are plenty of women who
would love this place.
            grace
yeah, and so would their pimps.                 *
           bruce                                *
i can't believe this. i did all                 *
this for us.                                    *
            grace                               *

                                                          90.



                     bruce
           i want that.
                    grace                                       *
           'that'. you can't even say the                       *
          word.                                                 *

          marriage, i want marriage, okay.                      *
          it's just not a great time right
          now.
                     grace
          not a great time. what is that,
          your mantra? this is never going
          to change. . .
grace heads down the stairs.                                    *
                    bruce
          come on grace, lighten up.                            .*
          tomorrow's saturday. the office is                    *
          throwing me a party here, for
          getting anchor. let's enjoy the
          ride for a whi le. we're just
          starting to have some fun.
                      grace
           no, you're just starting to have
           fun.
suddenly, the toilet flushes off camera. grace sees sam in
the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.
                      grace
           and what in god's name is going on
           with that dogi?
grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the
door.
                     grace
          i'm going to have debbie pick me
          up.
                     bruce
          grace.
                     grace
          i'm sorry, but    i won't be attending
          your little pa   rty tomorrow. and if                 *
          you would like    to see me after i
          will be at our   home.                                *

                                                           91.


she starts out.
                      grace (cont'd)
           oh, and that poor, struggling guy
           you talked about? i miss him.
