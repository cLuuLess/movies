int. bruce and grace's apartment - night

bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, grace. she has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.
                    bruce
          so, what do you think?
                       grace
          it's good.
                       bruce
          it sucks. it's a story about a
          cookie. people with eating
          disorders will be riveted,
               (goes into huge pathetic
                fan character)
          dear bruce, love the bakery piece.
          i can't wait to vomit so i can make
          room for more cookies.
                       grace
          i thought it was funny. i love the
          hair net. how'd you get it to do
          that?

                                                             4.



                        bruce
          what? i'm cutting that. they made
          me wear that stupid thing. i don't
          even look like myself. the hair is
          one of the most important parts of
          an on camera persona. right out of
          the gate, i lost the hair
          advantage.
grace looks at a photo,
                        grace
          oh, my gosh, look at this one. my
          sister is so drunk.
she places it in the album.
                        bruce
          grace. try to stay focused here.
          i need your help.
                     grace
          aren't you taking this a little too
          seriously?
                        bruce
           it's sweeps grace. it is serious.
           there's an anchor job open. this
           is important. this is our future!
bruce points to the tv as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. grace can't help but giggle.
                        grace
           i'm sorry.
bruce collapses into grace's arms like a child. he clearly
has a fragile temperament.
                     bruce
               (sighs)
          i'm never going to get anchor doing
          these kind of assignments. i want
          my work to matter.
                     grace
          it does matter. you're funny. you
          make people smile. come on, take a
          break, help me put this album
          together.

                    bruce
               (reluctant)
          alright.
grace holds up a photo.
                    grace
          oh look at this. it's the first
          day we moved in together.
it's the two of them, younger, laughing.
                      bruce
               (down)
          yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
                    grace
          oh, here's me at my sister's
          wedding. i caught the bouquet.
it's a picture of grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.
                    bruce
          you look pretty intense, hun.
                    grace
          well, i was thinking about you.
grace cuddles into bruce.
                    bruce
          so, you're attracted to me in some
          way, is that what you're trying to
          say?
grace rolls over onto bruce.
                    grace
          you have no idea.
                    bruce
          i was saving myself for the wedding
          night, but if you keep this up, i
          may lose my resolve.
grace stands, pulling bruce up.
                    grace
          well, that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
they kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.

                                                           6.



                       bruce
            hey, that's a good line, but you
            need more resonance. from the
            diaphragm.
                (newscaster voice)
            that's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      grace
            oh, say it again.
                      bruce
                (bigger)
            that's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      grace
                (sweet, southern groupie)
            oh, i just love on-air
            personalities.
                       bruce
                 (newscaster voice)
            well then, let me take these
            clothes off and slip into my hair
            net.
grace laughs, bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.
                                            cut to:
a television screen

we see the intro for sixty minutes:

                      news clip
            i'm ed bradley, i'm merely safer,
            an d i ' m --
leslie stahl is hit in the neck with a tranquilizer dart.
her head wavers, then drops on the desk. the camera pans to
bruce, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.
                      bruce
            ...bruce nolan. and this is sixty
            minutes.
the sixty minutes ticking clock

                                            dissolve to:

bruce's alarm clock - it rings
we are in. . .

                                                            7.
