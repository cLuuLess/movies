        int. spartan's apartment - night

        in darkness, spartan loudly bangs into something.

                                spartan
                  ahh.  lights.

        lights come up.  the place is, well, spartan.  exact
        same shape and size as huxley's, but stunningly sterile
        and unwarm.  spartan tragically takes in the place,
        pokes his head into a clinical bathroom, a bathroom with
        no toilet paper and a strange shelf with three seashells.
        shakes his head.

        spartan's hands start to quiver toward a knitting needle
        and a ball of red yarn.  curiously furrowing his brow,
        spartan plops into a strenuously uncomfortable futuristic
        chair and begins almost unconsciously knitting the red
        yarn.  he stops himself in perplexed surprise...

        suddenly, a loud bopping noise fills the air.  a beautiful
        nude woman, casually brushing her teeth, appears on a
        vidscreen before spartan.

                                nude woman (image)
                  hi, martin!  i was thinki -- ohmygod!
                  i'm sorry, wrong number --

        in a panic, the nude woman reaches o.s. and the image
        clicks off.  spartan smiles, then stops smiling.  he
        awkwardly calls out to the telescreen.

                                spartan
                  uh, telephone directory...

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                         (words appearing
                          simultaneously on the
                          screen)
                  videophone directory accessed.
                  spartan almost bails, but finally --

                                spartan
                         (a little worried)
                  do you have a number for a katie,
                  i guess it's katherine now,
                  spartan?  or maybe under her
                  mom's name, warren, or...
                         (the thought hits
                          him)
                  ... her mom might have even
                  re-remarried.  but she's passed
                  away now...

        shuts up.  realizes he's been rambling.

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                         (as soon as he shuts up)
                  katie spartan.  no ref.  katherine
                  spartan.  no ref.  katherine
                  warren.
                         (pause, pause)
                  no current ref.

                                spartan
                  was there one?

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                  listed offspring under madeline
                  warren through 2010.  listed
                  different number domicile until
                  2028.

                                spartan
                  what happened then?

        he can't believe he's having a dialogue with tv screen,
        but...

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                  no ref.

                                spartan
                         (dreading the answer)
                  did she die?

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                  no death certificate issued.
                  no ref.

                                spartan
                  good thing she didn't die without
                  permission.  did she move?

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                  no relocation license granted.
                  no ref.

                                spartan
                         (getting irked)
                  reason for 'no ref'?

                                vidscreen computer (v.o.)
                         (after a beat)
                  what number do you wish to call?
                  hangs up on him.

        the image blinks out, replaced by clouds and the "be
        well" slogan.  an annoyed spartan stares at the screen.
        he picks up the strange box lenina gave him.  inside it
        is a stack of petite laserdiscs.  spartan sticks the
        first laserdisc in his television.

        a surveillance camera shot shows the image of the explo-
        sion at the museum.  spartan pops the disc and puts
        another in.  this time the surveillance village shows
        cocteau and associate bob walking through the courtyard.
        then the gunshot.  then finally spartan comes to the
        strange face-to-face between cocteau and phoenix.
        spartan back-and-forth watches the stand~off with growing
        fascination.  he almost unconsciously reaches out to the
        sewing needles and the red yarn...
