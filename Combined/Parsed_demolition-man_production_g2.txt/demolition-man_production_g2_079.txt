        ext. cocteau complex - museum entrance - day

        the cops and passersby are in a state of shock.  a column
        of smoke still rises from somewhere in the middle of the
        building.  2042 fire department vehicles arrive.  a fire-
        man jumps into a control stand atop the vehicle, pulls a
        joystick, and the entire back of the truck lifts off,
        unmanned drone.  he guides it towards the blaze.  under
        all of which --

                                huxley
                  not bad for an eighty-four-year-
                  old!  simon phoenix knows he has
                  some competition.  he's finally
                  matched his meat.  you really
                  licked his ass!

                                spartan
                  uh, it's 'met his match.'  and
                  'kicked.'  kicked' his ass.

        cocteau takes a quivering chief earle aside.

                                cocteau
                         (coolly)
                  who is this man?

        in the b.g., associate bob arrives, tidily brushing
        dirt off himself.

                                earle
                  detective john spartan.
                  temporarily reinstated to the san
                  angeles police department to
                  pursue the madman simon phoenix.
                         (ready to cry)
                  you told us to do everything in
                  our power to capture the madman.

                                cocteau
                         (beat)
                  i did.  yes.  yes, i did.  i do
                  recall the exploits of john
                  spartan.  didn't they call him...
                  i think it was... the demolition
                  man.
                         (then)
                  it's quite all right, chief.
                  unexpected, creative, but quite
                  all right.  be well.

        earle nods.  still terrified.

                                cocteau
                  john spartan, welcome.  so, what
                  do you think of our fair society?

                                spartan
                  great, i come to the future,
                  phoenix gets the ray gun, i get
                  the rusty beretta.

        cocteau addresses spartan and the entire assemblage.

                                cocteau
                  john spartan, in honor of your
                  arrival, and your protection of
                  the sanctity of human life,
                  namely my own, i wish for you to
                  join me for dinner tonight.
                         (sees huxley
                          at his side)
                  the both of you.  i insist.
                  you must accompany me to taco bell.

        huxley looks seriously pleased and flattered.  spartan
        just has no clue as to this choice of restaurants.
        huxley discreetly elbows him.  hard.

                                spartan
                  uh.  that'd be great.
                         (befuddled)
                  looking forward to it...
