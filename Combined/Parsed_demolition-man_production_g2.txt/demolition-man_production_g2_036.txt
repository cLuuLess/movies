        int. lenina's office - day

        -- curses almost silently under her breath as she
        enters...

                                huxley
                  sanctimonious asshole.

        a morality box on the wall picks it up.

                                morality box (v.o.)
                  lenina huxley, you are fined one
                  half credit for a sotto voce
                  violation of the verbal morality
                  statute.

        lettering appears on the face of what appears to be a
        block of solid marble.  a thin sheaf of paper slides
        off the front with the reprimand.

        the contrast between everything we have seen so far and
        her office is staggering.  her quarters are filled with
        framed and faded nostalgia pieces of the 20th century.
        posters of violent movies, books, magazine covers, ad
        signs, artworks and framed newspapers, all of a dark
        nature.  a hopelessly sweet officer, alfredo garcia,
        sits in the middle of the room shaking his head...

                                garcia
                  whew... that was tense.

        lenina gives him a deadpan glare:

                                huxley
                  that was tense??  tell me
                  something, garcia, don't you get
                  bored codetracing perps who break
                  curfew and tell dirty jokes?

                                garcia
                  actually, i find my job deeply
                  fulfilling.
                         (looking around)
                  i just cannot swallow the reality
                  of this office, lenina huxley.
                  you're still addicted to the 20th
                  century high from its harshness,
                  buzzed by its brutality.  holy
                  smokes, is there anything in here
                  which doesn't violate contraband
                  ordinance 22?

                                huxley
                         (a sweet smile)
                  just you, alfredo garcia.  don't
                  you ever want something to happen?

                                garcia
                  goodness.  no.

                                huxley
                  i knew you were going to say that.
                         (sighs)
                  what i wouldn't give for some
                  action.
