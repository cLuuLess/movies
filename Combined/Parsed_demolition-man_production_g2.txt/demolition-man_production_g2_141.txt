        int. cocteau's office - night

        cocteau, bob, simon and the remaining cryocons are there
        listening to cocteau warble on --

                                cocteau
                  i wasn't counting on this, but i
                  must say you've worked out
                  beautifully.  people are terrified
                  of you.

                                phoenix
                         (don't flatter me)
                  ah, people have always been
                  terrified of me.

        cocteau continues his eerie soliloquy, feeding phoenix's
        amusement.  phoenix walks behind him under this, takes out
        a knife and behind raymond's back, tries desperately to
        kill him.  he can't.

                                cocteau
                  but this time they're truly scared.
                  soon they'll want to take the next
                  step -- security cameras in every
                  room, stricter alarm systems against
                  misbehavior, anonymous hotlines to
                  their neighbor's infractions...
                         (gloating)
                  i'll have carte blanche now to
                  create the perfect society.
                  everyone will want it.  an enzyme
                  injection for all citizens that
                  will insure everyone has the same
                  i.q., the same weight, and the
                  same desire to think only happy
                  thoughts.

        phoenix is back where cocteau can see him --

                                phoenix
                  i'm pretty happy now.  i think i'll
                  pass on that shot.

        phoenix steps off to one side, pulls an old airweight out
        of his belt.  aims it at cocteau, tries, tries to pull
        the trigger.  isn't going to happen.  he grunts in
        frustration.

                                cocteau
                         (lost in his
                          own reverie)
                  other cities will follow.  san
                  angeles will be a beacon of order
                  with the purity of an ant colony
                  and the beauty of a flawless pearl.

                                phoenix
                  nah.  you can't take away people's
                  right to be assholes.
                         (then; it's been
                          bothering him)
                  that's it, that's who you remind
                  me of -- an evil mr. rogers.

        cocteau smiles.  simon tosses the gun to elvin.

                                phoenix
                  you try to kill him.  this is
                  beginning to piss me off.

        elvin empties all six shots into cocteau's very surprised
        face.

        associate bob looks on from the corner.  a little
        frightened, but not giving a shit about cocteau.

                                phoenix
                  so what shall i do with you, bob?

                                associate bob
                  i am an excellent associate, sir.
                  i could work for you.
                         (off phoenix's doubt
                          of this)
                  dr. cocteau actually had me
                  endocrinecologically altered to
                  never wish to be anything but
                  an associate.

                                phoenix
                  what??

                                associate bob
                  i believe the slang that would best
                  express it across our chronological
                  gap, sir, would be that he -- cut
                  my balls off.

                                phoenix
                  literally?

        bob nods; simon claps him on the shoulder.

                                phoenix
                  bob, it's a sign of weakness to cut
                  the balls off the people who work
                  for you.  i'm gonna get you a new
                  set.

                                associate bob
                  why, thank you, sir.

                                phoenix
                  can we do that now?

        bob nods.

                                phoenix
                  i'm gonna get a couple extra
                  myself.  not that i need 'em.  but
                  just for spares...

                                associate bob
                  if i could interrupt...

        phoenix looks at him; this is not a good way to start...

                                associate bob
                  but the police are here.


        out window

        some ten stories down.  sure enough spartan and huxley
        are exiting the gto.


        back in office

                                phoenix
                  i'm gonna need to defrost more
                  guys, bob.  lots more guys.  can
                  you do that?

                                associate bob
                  indubitably.  but the computer
                  codes will have to emanate from
                  this office.  we will need a few
                  moments here before fleeing.
                         (sits at keyboard;
                          types away madly)
                  i might suggest that the, uh,
                  large gentlemen might be
                  considered, ah...
                         (sotto)
                  ...disposable.  especially with
                  rather large supply forthcoming.
                  perhaps they could be sent to
                  welcome mr. spartan.  if they
                  succeed, so much the better, if
                  not, they will at least hinder
                  his progress?

                                phoenix
                  i like you, bob.  you have no
                  heart.
                         (then)
                  guys, john spartan's on his way.
                  go downstairs.  kill him.

                                danzig
                  over and over and over...

        they leave.

                                phoenix
                  now, really, violent evil multi-
                  lifers.  i want guys who
                  understand that crimes come in
                  bunches.  not just a sporadic bit
                  of violence or law breaking here
                  and there.  i want guys who've
                  been on killing sprees before.
                  men who've crossed state lines
                  with impunity!  do you understand
                  me, bob?

                                associate bob
                         (still typing madly)
                  perfectly, sir.

                                phoenix
                  i'm gonna like running this place.
