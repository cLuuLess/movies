        int. cryo-prison - main room - day

        on a status panel:  cellular activity:  null.  tempera-
        ture:  .5 degree k.  lights begin to cycle.  a servo
        whines.  the camera moves to the chamber as the autolock
        begins to unwind.  unlock.  the arm moves aside.  the
        frozen puck rises from its chamber.  spartan hasn't
        moved, blinked in 40 years.

        two techs in insulated suits and gloves stand on either
        side.  both wear tiny flip-up welding goggles.  the
        first, takes out a durameter.  tests the puck.  harder
        than steel, a little less than a diamond.

        tech #2, holds a handheld magnesium thermite laser.
        about the size of a skill saw.  for the first time we
        notice there are six small raised half domes on top of
        the puck.  indices.  drops the guide ring at the end of
        the mtl over an index.  flips down his goggles.

        fires the mtl.  the entire puck lights up white white.
        we almost get the feeling spartan can sense what's
        going on.  a burst of energy melts a small hole in side
        of puck.  we stay on spartan.


        wide again

        tech #1 drives over a crane with a six-clawed arm.
        like a standing forklift.  or a gladiator... the
        fingers drop into the laser cut holes.  they raise
        the puck.  carry it away.
