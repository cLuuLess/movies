        int. cryo prison - lobby - night

        a reception desk.  a chaplain's office.  a be well bas
        relief.  very quiet, very still.

        spartan moves cautiously through.  a tiny rotating sensor
        picks up his presence.  locks on.  as spartan is looking
        the other way.  dr. raymond cocteau, in holo, suddenly
        appears in front of the display.

                  greetings, and be well.

        he never gets to say another word.  spartan spins and
        ventilates the device with 40 mm slugs.

        half a beat.  realizes what he's done.  in the next
        moment, four insane megadrenalized cryocons come
        screaming through the door.  barehanded, barefooted.
        spartan shoots the first two out of hand, without a
        thought.  but before he can fire again, the second two
        are on him.

        one gun goes flying.  spartan beats on howie with his
        free hand.  ignacious fights for control of his gun
        hand.

        spartan bashes howie back for a moment, continues to
        tussle with ignacious.  finally, he's had enough --

                                spartan
                  fine.  take it.

        he lets go of the gun.  ignacious grabs it and, still in
        shock over this turn of events, begins to fumble with
        it.  spartan reaches up with both hands and breaks
        his neck.

        howie leaps on him from behind, trying to do the same
        to spartan.  spartan squat presses down with this three
        hundred pound behemoth wrapped around his neck, retrieves
        the gun out of ignacious's stiffening fingers.  turns
        the barrel around towards himself.  howie reaches
        desperately, but it's just out of reach.  spartan
        fires over his shoulder.  howie, or what's left of him,
        slides away...
