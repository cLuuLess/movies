                  be well.

        silence reigns.  no one knows what to say.  lenina has
        her head in her hands in shock.

                                earle

                  he m.d.k.'ed everyone in a six
                  man squad.  with a strategic
                  apprehension computer.  destroyed

                  surveillance... a video-bite on
                  'unsolved mysteries'... none of
                  it worked.  in the end, it took
                  one man.  one cop.  john spartan.
