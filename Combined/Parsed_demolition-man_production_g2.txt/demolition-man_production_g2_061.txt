        int. cryo-prison - defrosting chamber - day

        the puck sits on a stainless steel podium.  completely
        alone in a round stainless steel room.

        three mtl lasers begin to pulsate madly.  one from above
        cutting in, spiraling in towards spartan.  the others top
        and bottom shaving an eighth of an inch in a tenth of a
        second with each pass.

        the puck shrinks away, the beams grow closer and closer
        to spartan.  just before they would hit him, the beams
        turn blue.  steam bursts from the puck.  fills the air.
        obscures everything.  the lasers stop.  darkness.

        the entire chamber splits open.  a room within a room.
        spartan rolls over limp and supple collapsing, onto his
        back.  med techs rush in.
