        ext. cryo-prison - day

        half in a prisoner's smock and half-dressed in salvaged
        parts of the guard's uniform, simon phoenix strolls outside
        the austere prison building, crossing an unimaginably
        perfect green lawn.  before him, in a small parking
        area, a doctor, wearing a white coat over "stylish" duds,
        opens up his sharp user-friendly sportscar with the code
        on the back of his hand.

                                phoenix
                  excuse me, doctor?

                                doctor
                  yes...

                                phoenix
                  open your mouth and say 'ahhhh!'

        simon's having a good time.
