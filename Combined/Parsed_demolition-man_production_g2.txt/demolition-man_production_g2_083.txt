        int. lenina's police car - moving - night

        spartan stares in amazement at huxley as she prattles
        on...

                                huxley
                         (a touch embarrassed;
                          a schoolgirl crush)
                  i've been an enthusiast of your
                  escapades for quite some time.
                  i have, in fact, perused some actual
                  newsreels of you at the
                  schwarzenegger library.  the time
                  you drove your car through that...

                                spartan
                  back up.  the schwarzenegger
                  library...

                                huxley
                  yes, the schwarzenegger
                  presidential library.  wasn't he
                  an actor when you...

                                spartan
                  stop... he was president?

                                huxley
                  even though he was not born in
                  this country, his popularity at
                  the time caused the 61st amendment
                  which states...

                                spartan
                         (waving her off)
                  i don't want to know...

        they drive in silence for a while, spartan staring out
        the window at 2042 passing by.

                                spartan
                  i keep looking around, thinking
                  about my daughter growing up in a
                  place like this.  i'm afraid she's
                  gonna think i'm some kind of
                  disgusting primate from the past.
                  as much as i want to see her, i
                  almost don't wanna know.  i'm not
                  gonna fit into the picture very
                  well.

        huxley reaches for the car terminal; thrilled with this
        small mischief.

                                huxley
                  it would be a minor misuse of
                  police powers but i could do a
                  search for you.

        spartan reaches over, stops her hand.  shakes his head
        "no."  there's a moment between the two of them.  he
        remembers he shouldn't touch her.  lets go.  she doesn't
        seem to mind.

                                spartan
                         (then; changing
                          subjects)
                  so, what's with this cocteau guy?
                  he thanks me for saving his life --
                  which i'm not sure i did --
                  invites me to dinner, and where
                  does he take me... taco bell.  i
                  mean, hey, i like mexican but
                  come on...

                                huxley
                  your tone is quasi-facetious.  you
                  do not realize taco bell was the
                  only restaurant to survive the
                  franchise wars.  all restaurants
                  are now taco bell.

        as they pull up in front --
