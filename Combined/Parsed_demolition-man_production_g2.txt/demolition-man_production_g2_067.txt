        int. san angeles museum of art and history - main
        hall - day

        the museum is located in the cocteau complex.  phoenix
        wanders through a hall arrayed with displays of various
        '80s/'90s/'00s/'10s artifacts.  a girl scout troop (in
        modernly-modulated uniforms) looking down as we realize
        that large sections of the floor of the entire museum
        are transparent.  below is an archeological exhibit of
        a section of the old city -- parts of buildings and
        streets.

                  if you care to sample what it was
                  like to spend a day in los angeles
                  in the twentieth century please
                  press the button.

        one of the scouts presses a large red button.  honking
        cars, swearing in spanish, gun shots, sirens, rap
        music... at the end of the hall, there's an arrow to
        another exhibit:  hall of violence.  phoenix grins.

                                phoenix
                  home sweet home...

        as he heads down the hall --
