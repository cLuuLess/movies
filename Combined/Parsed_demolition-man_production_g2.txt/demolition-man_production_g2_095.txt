        ext. court of stores - night

        spartan bursts forth from the trolley into the melee.

                                spartan
                  you're all under arrest.

        the scraps freeze for a moment.  this guy means business
        in a way they've never seen before.  but spartan is dis-
        tracted for a moment by an excited yell --

                                scrap raider
                  protein!  i've found protein!!

        this doesn't sound like hardened criminals to spartan.
        more scraps rush over to help him carry this booty away.
        a scrap appears beside spartan, swinging a pair of
        nunchucks made from two knobby table legs.

                                spartan
                         (wearily)
                  you're going to regret this for
                  the rest of your life.  both
                  seconds of it.

        nunchuck scrap thwaps spartan.  spartan just looks
        annoyed, not hurt.  slams him again.  still no reaction.
        spartan latches onto a nunchuck in the air as it comes
        toward him.  yanks it forward as he shoves the scrap
        backward into the food store window.  the scrap bounces
        off the window like a nerf ball, not remotely cracking
        it.  spartan frowns to himself.

                                spartan
                  maybe i'm losing my touch.

        two other scraps attack him.  spartan fends off one,
        shotputs the other into the window, this time shattering
        it competely.

                                spartan
                  better.

        up on the truck, payne, under an enormous load of food,
        appears.  takes quick stock of the situation.  he sees
        spartan.  has no idea who this guy is, but he's trouble.
        they exchange a look.

                                payne
                  we're outta here!
