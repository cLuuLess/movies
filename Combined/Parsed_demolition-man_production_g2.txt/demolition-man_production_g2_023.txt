        int. cryo prison - main room - day (2042)

        the viewer's viewpoint keeps pulling out to see that the
        date on spartan's monitor now reads august 3, 2042.
        warden smithers, now a bespectacled, gray-haired old
        man, in a peculiar uniform, shuffles past the completely
        unaged spartan.

        he grumbles by in a phone headset equipped with fiberoptic
        video gear, and out of frame we see that the
        prison has become vaster, stranger, with multiple grated
        catwalks and more networks of artfully-engineered piping.
        and heavily, heavily stocked with prisoners...

        smithers looks up at his holoset.  hovering in front of
        him in the air is lenina huxley.

                  mellow greeting, warden john j.
                  smithers.

                                smithers
                         (this again)
                  yeah.  be well.  lieutenant
                  lenina huxley.
