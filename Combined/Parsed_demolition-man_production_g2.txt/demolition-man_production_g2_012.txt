        int. fortress - main building - second floor - night

        phoenix is dumping can after can of gas all over the
        floor, the walls, everything.


        another angle - stairwell and landing

        spartan steps onto the landing.  checks high and low.
        room is clear.  he can smell the gas.


        back to phoenix

        simon pries open the fuse box.  flips off all the
        breakers.  building is plunged into darkness.


        back to spartan

        spartan quietly speaks into the lapd button mike on his
        lapel.

                                spartan
                  how 'bout some light, guys?

        half a beat later, blinding white light blows through
        the windows.
