        int. wasteland - bar

        it's as low life a place there is down here.  it's
        further dragged down by the presence, in the furthest
        back, darkest corner, of simon phoenix and six cryocons,
        freshly defrosted and each the size of a major appliance,
        albert, beppo, charlie, danzig, elvin and francis.  all
        a little groggy.  phoenix, very execu-criminal, sits at
        the head of the raggedy bar table.

                                phoenix
                  gentlemen, let's review.  it's
                  2042.  that's two oh four two, as
                  in the twenty-first century.  the
                  world is a pussy-whipped disney
                  channel version of itself and all
                  we gotta do to run the whole place
                  is kill this guy, named raymond,
                  who put it all together.  then
                  as an added bonus, you get to kill
                  the man who put most of us in the
                  freezer, your pal and mine, john
                  spartan.
                         (this goes over big;
                          now for the plan)
                  we can rape, loot, pillage, all
                  the fun things you remember.
                  this place is gonna be like a
                  theme park, but with our kinda
                  themes.  let's get busy.

                                beppo
                         (fixated on this
                          previous point)
                  we get to kill john spartan?

                                phoenix
                         (knows his clientele)
                  over and over and over, if you'd
                  like.

        beppo does like.  nods.  sounds like a good plan to
        everyone else as well.

                                phoenix
                         (throwing back his
                          drink)
                  salud.
