        ext. taco bell/court of stores - dusk

        the scene of the scraps' food truck attack.  as, on the
        cut, spartan wrenches off one of the steel planks.  it
        splits open with rush of air.  earle had no idea how to
        stop spartan, but he tries --

                                earle
                  please cease this madness,
                  enhance your calm, john spartan.

                                spartan
                  i've had it with enhancing my
                  calm.  i'm going to find phoenix
                  and enhance his calm instead.
                  i'm the only one here who can
                  handle this situation.

                                garcia
                  how will you accomplish this,
                  john spartan?

                                spartan
                  i'm going to blow his fucking
                  head off.

        spartan wrenches away another plank.  the others back off
        in fear.  it's like he's opening up the mouth to hell.

                                huxley
                  john spartan, even if simon
                  phoenix was programmed to escape,
                  extinguish life and steal
                  contraband weapons -- by forces
                  known or unknown -- pray tell why
                  are you proceeding to the depths
                  of wasteland?

        spartan wrenches off another plank.  now the hole is big
        enough to enter.  a set of rungs can be discerned.
        stops, looks at earle.  how can they all not get it?

                                spartan
                  the reason the citywide manhunt
                  didn't work was because phoenix
                  was down in the one place you a,
                  can't monitor, b, are afraid to
                  visit, and c don't give a shit
                  about.

                                earle
                         (then; braver)
                  whether phoenix is down there or
                  not, you just can't drop in.
                  resonate some understanding, the
                  wasteland is filled with thugs
                  and...

                                spartan
                  hooligans, i know.  we might
                  never come back.

                                earle
                  yeah.  you might like it down
                  there.

        spartan looks at him with a grin.

                                spartan
                  you made a joke.  there's hope
                  after all.
                         (then)
                  hey, how bad could it be...

        nobody has a clue.  it could be really bad.

                                spartan
                  look, you two don't have to do
                  this.  i can handle phoenix.

        huxley checks her stun baton and lights up a lightwand,
        (a hand-held flashlight device) and follows him in.

                                huxley
                         (eastwood tough)
                  hey, come on, let's go blow this
                  guy.

                                spartan
                  that's 'blow this guy away.'

                                huxley
                         (shrugs)
                  whatever.
