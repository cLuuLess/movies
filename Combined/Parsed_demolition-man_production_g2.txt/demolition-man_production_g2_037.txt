        int. cryo-prison - conference area - day

        simon phoenix is still fighting to shake off his
        defrosted confusion.  locks eyes with the warden.

        the look he gives smithers is chilling.

                                smithers
                  mr. phoenix, one of our first and
                  most illustrious members.  let's
                  get this one over quick...

        smithers is unsettled.  phoenix is far more awake than
        the norm.

                                smithers
                  twenty-nine years ago, the parole
                  system...

                                phoenix
                         (echoic; no logic yet)
                  twenty-nine years ago, the parole
                  system...

                                smithers
                         (firmer)
                  ... was rendered obsolete.

                                phoenix
                         (also firmer)
                  ... was rendered obsolete.

                                smithers
                         (sighs)
                  do you have something to say in
                  your behalf, mr. simon?
                         (beat)
                  i thought not.

                                phoenix
                         (bemused)
                  yeah.  yeah, i do.
                         (it puzzles him,
                          but...)
                  teddy bear.

        with a loud buzz, the electronic manacles around
        phoenix's arms and feet fly open.  phoenix knows a good
        thing when he sees it.  immediately panthers up for a
        savage kick into guard one, doubling him over.  phoenix
        tears from guard one's holster an air-injection syringe
        that is filled with the luminescent blue liquid.  he
        fires the syringe right into a charging guard two's
        forehead.  turns and approaches slowly and menacingly
        at guard one.

                                guard #1
                         (just able to breathe
                          again)
                  how did you know the password to
                  the cuffs?

                                phoenix
                         (laughing with
                          pleasure; who cares)
                  i have no idea...
                         (then)
                  simon says, too much talking from
                  you.

        phoenix smashes guard one in the neck.  left handed.
        crushes his larynx.  the guard falls dying to the ground.
        smithers crawls over his table, breaks for the door.
        phoenix effortlessly latches out to his fleeing neck
        and pulls him face-to-face as the guards behind them
        shiver into rigidity.  grins at him.  plucks a sharp
        pen from the warden's pocket.


        view from peephole

        the harmless red laser again flickers across warden
        smither's now bulging eyeball.
