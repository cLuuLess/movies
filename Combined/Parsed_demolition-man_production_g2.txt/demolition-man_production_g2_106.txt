        int. cocteau complex - cocteau's lobby - day

                                associate bob
                  i am ever so sorry, john spartan,
                  but dr. raymond cocteau is not
                  here for your unannounced visit.
                  i don't think i can access him at
                  this time.

        spartan grabs him by the throat.  pulls him inches away
        from his own face.

                                spartan
                  think again.

                                associate bob
                         (choked)
                  i'll give it my utmost efforts,
                  sir.

        spartan shoves him back.  bob drops to a keyboard.  his
        fingers fly madly.

                                associate bob
                  oh wonder of wonders, i have him
                  on fiberop in the conference
                  room.
