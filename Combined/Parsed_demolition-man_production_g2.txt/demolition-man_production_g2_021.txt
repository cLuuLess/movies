        int. cryo prison - stark white corridor - day

        spartan in stark white overalls.  a beautiful, shaken
        woman holding the hand of a small child.  about six.
        spartan bends down to the little girl.  unclenches his
        fist.  his lapd badge inside.  pins it on the little
        girl, katie.

                                spartan
                  i'm going to be back.  i'll still
                  be your dad.  i promise.

        she holds the badge, nods solemnly.  spartan kisses her
        on the cheek.

                                katie spartan
                  i love you, daddy.

        understands that her father is going away for good.
        spartan chokes back a sob.  stands back up.  kisses his
        wife.  everything that can be said, has been said.  they
        kiss again.

        behind him, in front of two locked doors, are a pair of
        prison guards in odd, heavily-insulated uniforms.  tanks,
        heater batteries, guns.  spartan heads towards the far
        doors.  they follow.  spartan steps through the doors,
        the guards now at either elbow.  and into --
