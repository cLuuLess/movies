        ext. blimp - night

        spartan falls three hundred feet from the blimp.  dead
        silent.  the line runs free behind him.  it's a giant
        fireproof bungee cord.  as the downward force of gravity
        and the upward pull of the bungee become exactly the
        same, spartan stops dead in the air for just the briefest
        moment.  whips out a bowie knife and slashes the cord
        above his head.  falls free the last ten feet to the roof
        of the building.  lands on his feet.  lightning cross
        draw.  a gun appears in each hand.
