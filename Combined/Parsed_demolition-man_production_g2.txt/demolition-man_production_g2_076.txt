        ext. museum - rear courtyard - day

        cocteau coolly walks through the freshly-landscaped
        courtyard.

        a large column of smoke rises out of a section of the
        museum.  associate bob frantically bobs about him.

                                associate bob
                  i'm sure, sir, the stress breeder
                  is inside being demobilized as we
                  speak...

        a bullet whistles by, barely missing bob.  he hurls
        himself into the dirt.  cocteau turns to face a jazzed-
        up phoenix, still draped in weapons, the acmag tucked in
        his belt.

                                phoenix
                  damn, being frozen has thrown
                  off my aim.  don't worry, i'll
                  kill you with the next shot.

                                cocteau
                  i don't think so.

        phoenix raises a luger to cocteau.  something snaps.
        phoenix's smile turns to a grimace.  his gun hand
        quivers.  he wants to kill, but he can't.  cocteau
        folds his arms.

                                cocteau
                  ah, no kiss-kiss.  no bang-bang...
                  and you were doing so well.  now,
                  don't you have a job to do?  don't
                  you have someone you have to kill?

        phoenix looks at him.  surprised and puzzled...

                                phoenix
                  yeah, i do...

        spartan comes crashing out of the wreckage.  loading
        the beretta as he runs, a crazed scowl on his face.
        phoenix leaps the wall.
