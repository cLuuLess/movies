        ext. police station - night

        the truck and phoenix's car roar out of the tunnel and
        move straight for the police station.  the truck smashes
        him again.  phoenix's steering wheel locks up and his
        seat restraint pops up as he races out of control for the
        station.  he screams in rage.

        spartan slams on the truck brakes, smokes, slips, slides,
        into the most horrific jackknife ever seen.  all four
        trailers lock up and accordian in on him.

        phoenix's vehicle slaps the street curb and begins to
        roll, convulsing into a spectacularly flaming series of
        somersaults that violently climax at the base of the
        sapd sign in front of the station.

        half a beat.

        a charring phoenix bursts from the vehicle, sees the
        approaching, out of control truck and turns and runs
        like hell.

        the truck slides in a full, unstoppable quadruple jack-
        knife towards the police station.

        spartan tries one last ditch attempt to bailout, but
        his door won't open, forced in by the first trailer bent
        over from the force of those behind.

        the truck hits the curb, flips, collapses and plows into
        the police station.
