        ext. lenina's apartment - morning

        lenina is waiting outside her car as spartan emerges from
        the building.

                                huxley
                         (all business)
                  detective...

                                spartan
                         (getting in the
                          driver's side)
                  i've got to learn to do this
                  sometime.

        spartan tosses lenina a suavely-knitted sweater of
        familiar red yarn.

                                spartan
                  this is for you, huxley.

                                huxley
                  oh, thanks...
