        int. lenina's apartment - night

        black screen

                                huxley (o.s.)
                  everything is voice-coded.  so if
                  you need something...

        a door opens in the darkness.

                                huxley
                  ... just ask.  lights.

        lights come up.  the place is like one of the 50's
        diners that never existed in the fifties, the apartment
        is a monstrosity -- a melange of 80's and 90's styles
        never quite seen together in this way.

                                huxley
                         (proudly)
                  what do you think?  i clicked off
                  a lot of credits to create the
                  perfect 20th century apartment.

                                spartan
                  it's very...

        not sure what.  just nods at all.  she beams.

                                huxley
                  isn't it?
                         (then; a little
                          halting)
                  john spartan, there is of course a
                  well-known and documented connection
                  between sex and violence.  not so
                  much a causal effect, but a state
                  of general neurological arousal.

        spartan looks at her.  he has no idea what her point is.

                                huxley
                  and after observing your behavior
                  and my resultant condition, i was
                  wondering if you would like to
                  have sex?

        he had no idea that was going to be her point.

                                spartan
                  with you?
                         (as she nods)
                  now?
                         (as she nods
                          again)
                  ahhh, ahhh, mmm, yeah.

                                huxley
                  great.

        she turns quickly to a cabinet and removes two strange
        high-tech helmets and a towel.  lenina, all excited, puts
        one of the helmets on his head and hands him the towel.

        flicks a switch on the side of the helmet -- read-out
        lights come on; activated.  lenina sits upon a bed
        opposite spartan, and repeats the operation on herself
        with the other helmet.

                                huxley
                  now you have to relax.  we'll
                  start in a few seconds.

                                spartan
                  start what?

                                huxley
                  having sex, of course.

        and she flicks on the switch on her own helmet.


        virtual reality world

        lenina appears floating, a diaphanous gown blowing
        gently about her.  she floats slowly towards us, as she
        begins to peel off and discard pieces of the gown which
        dissolve immediately away.  as she approaches nakedness...
