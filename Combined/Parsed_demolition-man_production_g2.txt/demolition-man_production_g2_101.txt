        int. lenina's apartment - night

        a beat of open-mouthed amazement and enjoyment and then
        spartan tears the helmet from his head and throws down
        his towel with a mixture of confusion and anxiety.
        lenina is still seated across the room.

                                huxley
                  what's wrong?  you broke contact.

                                spartan
                  contact?  i haven't even touched
                  you yet!

        lenina removes her helmet with some confusion and hurt.

                                huxley
                  but... but i thought you wanted
                  to make love.

                                spartan
                  this is like boning ms. pacman.

        lenina stands, tossing her helmet down, and faces
        spartan.

                                huxley
                         (flustered)
                  vir-sex has been proven to
                  produce higher orders of
                  alpha waves during digitized
                  transference of sexual energies!

                                spartan
                  waddya say we just do this the
                  old-fashioned way?

        she looks at him, backing away in shock and disgust.

                                huxley
                  uuuugh.  you mean... fluid transfer?!

                                spartan
                  boning, doing the wild mambo,
                  you know...
                         (demonstrates)
                  ... the hunka chunka.

                                huxley
                  that is no longer done!

        spartan looks at her like she's out of her mind.

                                huxley
                  exchange of bodily fluids?  do
                  you know what that leads to?

                                spartan
                  kids, smoking, a desire to raid
                  the fridge.

                                huxley
                  the rampant exchange of bodily
                  fluids was one of the major reasons
                  for the downfall of society.
                         (trying to explain
                          calmly)
                  after aids there was nrs.  after
                  nrs there was ubt.  one of the
                  first things dr. cocteau was able
                  to do was outlaw and behaviorally
                  engineer all fluid transfer out
                  of societally-acceptable
                  behavior.  not even mouth
                  transfer is condoned.

                                spartan
                  there's no kissing anymore...?
                  i was a good kisser...

                                huxley
                  ughh.

                                spartan
                  what about kids?

                                huxley
                  procreation?  we go to the lab.
                  fluids are purified, screened
                  and transferred by authorized
                  medical personnel only.  ugh.
                  ugh...

                                spartan
                  i didn't...

                                huxley
                  you are a savage creature.  john
                  spartan, i wish you to leave my
                  domicile now!

        she points to the door.  stamps her foot.  some things
        never change.  he wants to explain.  she stamps her foot
        again.  he leaves.
