        int. lenina's police car - moving - day

        behind the wheel, the mischievously-beautiful lenina
        huxley.  a heads up display announces she is calling
        warden john j. smithers.  the order of business is
        "prison population informative query."  and future or
        not, lenina fusses with her hair.  with both hands.
        the steering wheel is not present at all.

                                huxley
                  i am hereby querying you on the
                  prison population update.
                         (hopefully)
                  does the tedium continue?


        on heads up display

        warden smithers gently reminds her that ---

                                smithers (image)
                  incontrovertibly and unequivocally,
                  yes.  the prisoners are ice cubes.
                  they do not move.  they have no
                  thoughts, they have no feelings...
                  the tedium is permanent,
                  lieutenant.
