        int. cryo prison - outer thawing room - night

        the inner room splits open and the med techs rush in to
        the four thawed cryocons as associate bob steps away from
        a vidscreen with some concern ---

                                associate bob
                  there's been a breach in the outer
                  gate.  an intruder has entered the
                  cryofacility and i feel it's safe
                  to assume it's john spartan.

        phoenix is momentarily taken aback by spartan's relent-
        lessness.  then he looks at his four new recruits.
        they're still kinda dopey.  turns to a med tech ---

                                phoenix
                  got some really wild uppers?
                  speed, crank, amphetamines?
                  anything?

                                med tech
                         (a little confused,
                          but...)
                  we have pure megadrenalin, sir.

                                phoenix
                  good.  whack these guys with it.
                  a bunch.

        he does.  they come wildly awake, gunther, howie,
        ignatious, and jed.  eyes wide, jittery, completely
        cranked.  phoenix keeps it simple ---

                                phoenix
                  hey wake up.  good.  listen to
                  me.  you've just been defrosted.
                  it's the future.  john spartan is
                  out those doors.
                         (a beat; he smokes;
                          this should be fun)
                  go kill him.

        gunther lets out the kind of scream the nfl would be
        proud of.  charges out the door, others behind him.
