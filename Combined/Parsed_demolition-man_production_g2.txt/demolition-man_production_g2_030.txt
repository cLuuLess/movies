        int. cryo-prison - defrosting chamber - day

        -- a steel intercom box on the wall.  two med techs load
        a still unconscious prisoner into another wheelchair.  we
        don't see him.  just a hint of a well muscled black arm
        and a head still lolling unconscious on a shoulder, with
        blond hair...
