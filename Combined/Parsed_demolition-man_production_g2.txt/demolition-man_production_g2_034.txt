        int. sewer tunnel - day

        thomas payne, a young wild-haired madman in some kind
        of ancient mechanics coveralls watches through the
        periscope.

                                payne
                  ... these assholes are nothing if
                  not predictable.

        two other equally disreputable types are with him.
        scraps, leftovers from the perfect world above.

                                scrap #1
                         (worried)
                  we're not ready.

                                payne
                  hey guy, it doesn't really matter
                  if we're ready or not anymore.

        payne's got things to do, people to see.  takes off down
        the tunnel.  the other two follow.  as the periscope
        ducks back down ---
