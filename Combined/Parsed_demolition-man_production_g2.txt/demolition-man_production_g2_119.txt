        int. wasteland - large cavern - floor - night

        simon pounds a rushing up garcia unconscious in a single
        blow.  recovers and empties a tommy gun at the crowd.
        scraps crawl for cover.  payne and two others fire back.
        phoenix disappears.  spartan blitzkriegs out of the
        refuse.  crazed.

        spartan stampedes away.
