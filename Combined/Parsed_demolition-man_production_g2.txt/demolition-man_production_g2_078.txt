        ext. museum - rear courtyard - day

        spartan takes aim - out of range.  fuck.  turns to
        cocteau.

                                spartan
                  you don't know how fucking lucky
                  you are that maniac didn't whack
                  you.

                                cocteau
                  no doubt whacking, whatever it
                  is, would be extremely bad.  you
                  scared him away and i do not know
                  how to thank you.  you saved my
                  life.

        spartan gives a suspicious glance from the wall to
        cocteau as cocteau leads him...
