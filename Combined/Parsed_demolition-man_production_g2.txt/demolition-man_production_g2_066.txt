        int. police station - lenina's office - day

        spartan examines all the technowonders as lenina punches
        up an illustration on the screen:  a small, square micro-
        chip being surgically inserted into the top of a hand.
        it's tied into the veins and blood supply as well.

                                huxley
                  simon phoenix isn't coded.  an
                  organically bioengineered microchip
                  was developed that could by sewn
                  into the skin.  sensors all around
                  the city can zero in on anyone at
                  any time.

                                tough cop
                  i can't even conceive a visual of
                  what you cops did before it was
                  developed...

                                spartan
                  we worked for a living.  this
                  fascist crap makes me wanna puke.

                                earle
                  what do you think you're
                  scratching, caveman?
                  you really surmise we'd let you
                  out without control?  your code
                  was implanted the second you
                  thawed.

        spartan seethingly contemplates his itching hand.

                                spartan
                  why didn't you just shove a leash
                  up my ass?!

                                earle
                  dirty meat-eater!  no matter how
                  viking your era was, i cannot
                  digest how you ever wore a badge!
                  you're going back, john spartan,
                  oh yes, you're going back.

                                huxley
                  could you two please dump some
                  hormones?  we need every cortex we
                  can get in this situation.

                                earle
                  we don't need him.  our computer
                  has already examined all feasible
                  scenarios resulting from the
                  appearance of simon phoenix and
                  determined he will attempt to
                  start up a new drug lab and form
                  a crime syndicate.

                                female computer (v.o.)
                  that is correct, chief george
                  earle.

                                spartan
                  i hate to interrupt you two
                  lovebirds, but that's fucking
                  stupid.  you think he wants to
                  build a business?  phoenix is
                  going for a gun.  plain and
                  simple.

        as spartan rages, roaming around the station, morality
        boxes have heart attacks keeping up with his offenses.

                                spartan
                  phoenix is a complete meglomaniacal
                  fucking psychopath.  and the first
                  thing simon is going to want to do
                  is wipe the smug smiles off your
                  shiny faces.
                  he could just handshake your asses
                  to death, but who's got the
                  goddamn patience.  trust me, he's
                  going for a gun.

                                earle
                  who cares what this primate thinks.
                  resonate some understanding.  the
                  only place a person can even view
                  a gun in this city, is at a...
                  museum!
