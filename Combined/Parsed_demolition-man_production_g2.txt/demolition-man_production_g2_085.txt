        int. taco bell - front counter area - night

        sparse, elegant and melrose-dark.  as huxley and spartan
        enter a mariachi band takes their place in the corner.
        huxley and spartan walk up to a sultry future version of
        a taco bell order counter.  spartan is trying to
        assimilate it all when the counter-girl breaks the ultra-
        cool character of the restaurant to give him a typical
        fast food happy face.

                                countergirl
                  hi!  may i help you?

                                spartan
                  uh, i'll take a burrito supreme
                  and a shake?

                                countergirl
                  will that be for here or to go?

                                spartan
                  ah.  the eternal question... here.

        she does a perky fast food spin to the station behind
        her and whips back a silver tray holding an ornate china
        set.

                                countergirl
                  burrito supreme.  shake.  be well.

        spartan looks down to a miniscule cylinder of pressed
        kelp topped with a dab of salsa and small sesame-seed-
        type bits.  the tiny shake is in a thimble-sized frost-
        covered glass.

                                spartan
                  oooh.  yum... good thing i'm
                  hungry.
