        int. fortress - main building - stairwell - night

        spartan creeps quietly down.  looking, watching,
        listening.  suddenly, the stairs are racked with machine
        gun fire.  chips of concrete fly from around his feet.
        spartan flattens against the wall.  half a beat.  steps
        out firing.  the machine gun stops.  a body plummets by
        down the center shaft of the stairs.

                                spartan
                  that's a warm welcome.
