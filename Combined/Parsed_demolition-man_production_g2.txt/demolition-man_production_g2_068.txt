        ext. police station - day

        spartan, lenina, and garcia stride towards huxley's
        cruiser.

                                spartan
                  it's a hunch.  trust me on this.
                  it's a cop thing.
                         (as they get into
                          the car)
                  i'm driving.

        spartan gets into the driver's side.  lenina gets in the
        passenger.  a beat.  they both emerge.

                                spartan
                  you're driving.
