        ext. los angeles - airborne - moving - night (1998)

        a city on fire.  a block here, block there.  more tracer
        fire.  a cross between the la riots and gulf war.  a
        supered title:  la riot iii.  and then fading in below:
        month 4.  we continue moving above the ravaged city --

                  you imagine what it was like when
                  they had to fly choppers through
                  this shit?

                                voice #2 (v.o.)
                  not even.

        gliding totally silently into frame is the biggest,
        darkest, midnight blue blimp you've ever seen.  small
        gold letters on the side -- lapd.  fully armored beneath.
        woven kevlar on the sides.  bullets rebound with a long
        zzzzzip off the sides.  ping softly off the plastic armor
        on the bottom.

                  i don't understand where we're
                  going and why the hell we're
                  bothering anyhow...

        a new voice responds.  this one brooks no discussion --

                                spartan (v.o.)
                  because there's anger and there's
                  frustration, and then there's pure
                  fucking evil...
