        ext. cocteau complex - museum entrance - day

        the sapd car is parked at the curb.  doors popped open.
        museum patrons and guards flee.  spartan, followed by
        huxley and garcia, moves against the flow.

        a cylindrical metal periscope suddenly pops up from the
        sidewalk.  as spartan stares down at it, the periscope
        zips back down the hole.

                                spartan
                  you see that?

                                garcia
                  what?

                                spartan
                  never mind.  i give up trying to
                  figure this place out.

                                garcia
                         (holding out his
                          s.a.c.)
                  procedure?

                                s.a.c. (v.o.)
                  establish communication with
                  maniac intruder.

                                spartan
                  wrong.
                         (he takes the s.a.c.,
                          smashes it to the
                          ground)
                  hey.  luke skywalker.  use the
                  force.

        spartan heads for the door.  garcia has a distraught
        moment before following.  garcia hands spartan a stun
        baton.  it sparks to life.

                                spartan
                  what the hell's this?

                                garcia
                  it's a glow rod.  it's what we
                  got.

                                spartan
                  does it work?

        spartan casually pokes out to a nearby scared guard.
        the guard drops like a dead weight.

                                spartan
                  guess so.

                                huxley
                  they've got him trapped in section
                  eight.

                                spartan
                  trapped?  the maniac intruder?
                  that i doubt.  oh, would you make
                  sure for me that nobody else is
                  in the building?

                                huxley
                         (understands)
                  done.
                         (as she turns to the
                          guards)
                  i want a visual.  now.  every
                  corridor in the museum.  i want
                  full sensors routed to me.  and i
                  want it ninety seconds ago...

        they start to scurry.  there's a moment as he appreciates
        her skill and ---
