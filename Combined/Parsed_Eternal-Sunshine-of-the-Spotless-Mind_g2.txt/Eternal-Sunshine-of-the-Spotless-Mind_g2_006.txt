mierzwiak directs clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  mierzwiak
sits across from her.  he smiles.

		mierzwiak
	how are you today?

		clementine
	okay, i guess.

		mierzwiak
		(nodding sympathetically)
	well, why don't you tell me what's going
	on?  do you mind if i turn this on?

he indicates a tape recorder.

		clementine
	i don't care.

he turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.

		clementine (cont'd)
	well, i've been having a bad time of it
	with um, my boyfriend, i guess.

		mierzwiak
	you guess he's your boyfriend?  or you
	guess you're having a bad time with hm?

		clementine
	what?  no.  i don't like the term
	boyfriend.  it's so gay.

mierzwiak nods.  he's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
throughout.

		clementine (cont'd)
	maybe gay isn't the right word.  but,
	anyway, it's been rough with him...
	whatever the fuck he is.  heheh.  my
	significant other... heh heh.  and i
	guess on a certain level, i want to break
	it off, but i feel... y'know... it's like
	this constant questioning and re
	questioning.  do i end it?  should i give
	it more time?  i'm not happy, but what do
	i expect?  relationships require work.
	you know the drill.  the thing that i
	keep coming back to is, i'm not getting
	any younger, i want to have a baby... at
	some point... maybe... right?  so then i
	think i should settle -- which is not
	necessarily the best word -- i mean, he's
	a good guy.  it's not really settling.
	then i think maybe i'm just a victim of
	movies, y'know?  that i have some
	completely unrealistic notion of what a
	relationship can be.  but then i think,
	no, this is what i really want, so i
	should allow myself the freedom to go out
	and fucking find it.  you know?  agreed?
	but then i think he is a good guy and...
	it's complicated.  y'know?

		mierzwiak
	i think i know. i think we can help.  why
	don't you start by telling me about your
	relationship.  everything you can think
	of.  everything about him.  everything
	about you.  and we'll take it from there.

she nods, thinks.

		clementine
	um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --
