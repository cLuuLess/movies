int. joel's bedroom - night

mierzwiak works the equipment.  he has located a small area
of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.

		mierzwiak
	i'm getting the hang of it.  i still
	understand it.  but i'm finding him
	quickly enough.  i'm hopeful there won't
	be too much peripheral eradication.

mary sits on the bed.

		mary
		(a little giggly)
	i like watching you work.

stan sighs, grabs his coat.

		stan
	i'll go out for a smoke.  if no one
	minds.

		mierzwiak
		(not looking up)
	that's fine, stan.

mary doesn't say anything.  stan huffs and is out the door.
mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  mary
gets up her courage to speak.

		mary
	do you like quotes, howard?

		mierzwiak
	how do you mean?

		mary
	oh, um, like famous quotes.  i find
	reading them inspirational to me.  and in
	my reading i've come across some i
	thought you might like, too.

		mierzwiak
	oh.  well, i'd love to hear some.

mary is thrilled, beside herself.  she tries to calm down.

		mary
	okay, um, there's one that goes "blessed
	are the forgetful, for they get the
	better even of their blunders."

		mierzwiak
	is that nietzsche?

		mary
	yeah, yeah it is, howard.  and here i was
	thinking i could tell you something you
	didn't know.

		mierzwiak
	it's a good quote, mary.  i'm glad we
	both know it.

he smiles at her.  she's flustered, flattered.

		mary
		(sputtering)
	there's another one i like, i read.  it's
	by pope alexander.

		mierzwiak
	alexander pope?

		mary
	yes, shit.  oops, sorry!
		(puts hand over mouth)
	sorry.  it's just i told myself i wasn't
	going to say pope alexander and sound
	like a dope and then i go ahead and do
	it.  like i psyched myself out.

		mierzwiak
	it's no big deal.

		mary
	you are such a sweetheart.

there's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
then mary plunges ahead to bury it.

		mary (cont'd)
	anyway, the quote goes "how happy is the
	blameless vestal's lot!  the world
	forgetting, by the world forgot: eternal
	sunshine of the spotless mind!  each
	prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".

she smiles, proud and embarrassed.

		mierzwiak
	that's lovely.

		mary
	really?  i thought it was appropriate
	maybe.  that's all.
		(beat, then quickly)
	i really admire the work that you do.  i
	know it's not proper to be so familiar
	but i guess since we're outside the
	workplace i feel a certain liberty to --

		mierzwiak
	it's fine, mary.  i'm happy to hear it.

		mary
	okay.  good.  great.  thanks.
		(blurting)
	i like you, howard... an awful lot.  is
	that terrible?

mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
unflappable self.

		mierzwiak
	you're a wonderful girl, mary.

she leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.

		mary
	i've loved you for a very long time.  i'm
	sorry!  i shouldn't have said that.

		mierzwiak
	i've got a wife, mary.  kids.  you know
	that.

		mary
		(suddenly weepy)
	i wish i was your wife.  i wish i had
	your kids.

mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  it turns into kiss.  he
pulls away.

		mierzwiak
	we can't do this.

		mary
	no you're right.  once again.  you're a
	decent man, howard.

he smiles sadly at her.  she smiles courageously at him.

		mierzwiak
	i want you to know it's not because i'm
	not interested.  if that means anything.

they look at each other a long while, then howard goes back
to locating and eradicating blips of lights.
