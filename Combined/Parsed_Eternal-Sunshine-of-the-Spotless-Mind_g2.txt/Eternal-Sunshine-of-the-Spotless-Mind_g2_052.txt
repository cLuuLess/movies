int. joel's apartment - night

stan watches the screen.  patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
the unconscious joel.

		patrick
	i gotta tell you something.  i kind of
	fell in love with her last night.

		stan
	she was unconscious, patrick.

		patrick

	and voluptuous.  i kind of stole a pair
	of her panties, is what.

		stan
