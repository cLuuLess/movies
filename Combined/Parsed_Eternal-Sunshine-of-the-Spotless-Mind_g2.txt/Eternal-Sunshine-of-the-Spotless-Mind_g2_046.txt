int. elevator - day

joel gets off on the sixth floor.  he searches for a room
number.  as he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
faded, vague and mostly erased.  he keeps walking, comes to
the door marked lacuna and opens it.  inside he can see
vague, erased version of mary the receptionist.

		mary
		(dead monotone)
	hi, may i help you?

these degraded, faded memories allow joel to detach himself
and hear what's going on in his bedroom.

		stan's voice
	so, mary's coming over tonight.

joel looks up.
