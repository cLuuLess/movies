a soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered
friends.

a couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.

		man
	i...i... i... find you physically
	repulsive!  i can't even look at you!

they look at each other in silence.

a little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession
of boys.

the aftermath of a car accident from the driver's pov.

mary having an abortion.
