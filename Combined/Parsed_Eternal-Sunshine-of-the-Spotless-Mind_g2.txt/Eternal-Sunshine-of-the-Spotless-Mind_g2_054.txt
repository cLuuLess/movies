int. joel's apartment - night

joel and clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the tv.
it's hard to make out what they're watching.
they sit on opposite ends of the couch.  they look bored.
the scene quickly degenerates.  the room fades.

		patrick's voice
	okay, but there's more.

joel listens.

		patrick's voice (cont'd)
	after we did her, i went to where she
	worked and i asked her out.

joel looks over at the faded clementine across the couch.
she stares straight ahead at the tv.

		stan's voice
	patrick... do you know how unethical...

		joel
	that must be the guy i saw you with.

		voice-over
	in the bookstore that night.  the skinny
	guy.

there's a click and joel finds himself in --
