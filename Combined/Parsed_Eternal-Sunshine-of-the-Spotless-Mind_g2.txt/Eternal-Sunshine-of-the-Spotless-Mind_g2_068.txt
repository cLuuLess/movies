ext. charles river - night

joel and clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
river.  they look up at the stars.

		joel
	...die right now, clem.  i'm just...
	happy.  i've never felt that before.  i'm
	just exactly where i want to be.

clementine looks over at him.  her eyes are filled with love
and tears.  then they get vague.  the scene is being erased.
joel is panicked.

		joel (cont'd)
	clem, no!  this can't keep happening.
	please!  oh, fuck!  please!

crazily, joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
scenes: he and clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
cheese and tomato soup together in bed, joel watching her
sleep, them drinking at a bar.  he arrives at a decayed
version of his first meeting with mierzwiak.

		mierzwiak
	we can help you through this.  why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about --

		joel
	you have to stop this!

		mierzwiak
	what?  what do you mean?

		joel
	i'm trapped in my head and everything i
	love is being erased!  stop it now!

		mierzwiak
	yes, but... i'm just something you're
	imagining.  what can i do?  i'm in your
	head, too.
