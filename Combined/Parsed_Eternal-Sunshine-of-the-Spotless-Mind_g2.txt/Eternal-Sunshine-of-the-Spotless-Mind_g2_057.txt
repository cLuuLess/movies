int. bar - night

it's noisy and crowded.  joel and clementine sit at a small
table.  she is drunk and staring off, blankly.

		joel
	so, um --

		clementine
		(swiveling head toward him)
	would you get me another, joely?

joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.

		clementine (cont'd)
	thanky!  thanky!

joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.

joel is paying the bartender.  he turns with the drink to
head back to the table.  he sees clementine flirting with a
man in joel's seat.

joel is at the table.  clementine looks from her
conversation.

		clementine (cont'd)
	joel, this is mark.  he likes my boobs.
	he came over special to tell me that.
	isn't that nice.  he doesn't think i'm
	fat.

the scene starts to fade.  mark rises.

		mark
	i didn't know she was with someone, man.

		clementine
	s'okay, mark.  joel doesn't like my
	boobs.
		(stage whisper)
	i don't think he likes girls.

the bar gets quiet and vague.

		joel
	you're drunk.

		clementine
	you're a whiz kid.  so perceptive, so --

clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.

a doorbell buzzes.  joel looks up.
