int. rob and carrie's living room - night

joel sits across rob and carrie, mid-40's.

		joel
	why would she do that?

		carrie
	i don't know, honey.  it's horrible.

		joel
	she's punishing me for being honest.  i
	should just go to her house.

		rob
	i don't think you should go there, joel.

		joel
	yeah, i don't want to seem desperate.

		carrie
	maybe you need to look at this as a sign
	to move on.  just make a clean break.

		joel
	i don't know.  i'm so... i can't believe
	she'd be so goddamn immature!

		rob
	joel, look, the thing is --

		carrie
		(agitated, interrupting)
	joel, honey... we have to feed the dog.
	would you just wait here?  just a second.

joel nods, confused, as rob and carrie leave the room and
close the door behind them.  joel hears a hushed argument
ensue in the hall.  he notices the dog asleep on the floor.
he grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  a
subscription card falls to the floor.  he picks it up and is
about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
a subscription card at all.  it reads:

 clementine kruczynski has had joel barish erased from her
  memory.  please never mention their relationship to her
		 again.  thank you.

		     lacuna ltd.
		     610 11th avenue, ny, ny

joel stares at the card, incredulous.

later: rob and carrie are now back in the room.

		carrie (cont'd)
	you weren't supposed to see that.

		joel
	they can't erase memories.  it's a joke.
	it's a nasty clementine hoax.

		carrie
	sweetie, we called the company.

joel just stands there.

	lacuna:  noun.  a blank, a missing
	portion, especially in a manuscript.
