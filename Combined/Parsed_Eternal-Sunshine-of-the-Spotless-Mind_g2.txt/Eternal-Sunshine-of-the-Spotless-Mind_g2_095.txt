ext. joel's apartment building - continuous

the woman is at her car.  stan watches from the van.
mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.

		mierzwiak
	hollis!  hollis!

		hollis (the middle-aged woman)
	i knew it, howard.  i don't even know why
	i bothered to copy the damn address.

		mierzwiak
	it didn't start out to be this.  i came
	here to work.  it's a one-time mistake.

mary is right behind mierzwiak now.  hollis is in her car.

		mary
		(heroically)
	mrs. mierzwiak, it's true.  and it's not
	mr. mierzwiak's fault.  i'm a stupid
	little girl with a stupid little crush.
	i basically forced him into it.  i swear.

hollis turns, looks at mary and then at mierzwiak.

		hollis
	don't be a monster, howard.  tell the
	girl.

stan is out of the van now, listening.  mary shivers in the
cold, hugs herself.  there's a long silence.  then:

		mary
	tell me what?

hollis and mierzwiak have locked eyes.  mary looks back and
forth between them.  hollis starts her car.

		hollis
	poor kid.  you can have him.  you did.

she drives off.  mary watches howard with increased
foreboding.

		mary
	what, howard?

		mierzwiak
	we... have a history.  i'm sorry.  you
	wanted the procedure.  you wanted it
	done... to get past.  i have to finish in
	there.  it's almost morning.  we'll talk
	later.

he shuffles inside.  mary stands there, unable to digest
this, struggling in vain to remember.  stan watches.

		stan
	let me take you home.

mary shakes her head "no."  she walks off, dazed.
