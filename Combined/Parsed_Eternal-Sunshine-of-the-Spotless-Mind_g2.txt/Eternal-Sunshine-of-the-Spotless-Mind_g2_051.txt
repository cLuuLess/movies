ext. street - continuous

it's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
there is obscured in darkness.  joel wanders it.  in the
distance clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
she doesn't get any farther away.  it's lonely.

		patrick's voice
	see, remember that girl?  the one we did
	last week?  the one with the potatoes?

joel looks up, startled.

		stan's voice
	yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  was.
