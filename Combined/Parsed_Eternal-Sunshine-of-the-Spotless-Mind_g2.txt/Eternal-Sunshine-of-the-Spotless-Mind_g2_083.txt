int. car - night

clementine and joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
the characters on the screen are saying.

		clementine
	but can't you see... i love you, antoine.

		joel
	don't call me antoine.  my name is wally.

		clementine
	yes, but i can't love a man named wally.

she starts to fade.  the scene starts to fade.  joel
remembers their previous plan.

		joel
	they found us before.  the plan didn't
	work.  i don't know what to do now.

		clementine
		(mouthing to woman on screen)
	hide me somewhere deeper?  somewhere
	buried?

joel grabs her.  they run off just as the scene decays into a
husk behind them.
