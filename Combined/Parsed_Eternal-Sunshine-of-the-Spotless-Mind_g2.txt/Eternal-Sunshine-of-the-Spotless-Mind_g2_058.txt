int. joel's apartment - night

patrick opens the door.  mary stands there in a winter coat,
carrying a backpack.

		mary
		(coolly)
	oh, hey, patrick.

		patrick
	hi, mary.  how's it going?

she walks past him.

		stan
	hey, you.

stan and mary kiss.  she looks down at joel as she takes off
her coat.

		mary
	it's freezing out.

		stan
	you found us okay?

		mary
	yeah.
		(re: joel)
	poor guy.
		(looking around)
	have anything to drink?

		stan
	we haven't checked.

		mary
	well, allow me to do the honors.  it's
	fucking freezing and i need something.

she heads into the kitchen.  stan turns back to monitor the
slivers of light.

		patrick
	mary hates me.  i've never been popular
	with the ladies.

		stan
	maybe if you stopped stealing their
	panties.

		patrick
		(guilty beat)
	okay, there's more, stan --

stan looks over at patrick.  mary returns with a bottle of
scotch and two glasses.

		mary
	hey, hey.

she pours the whiskey.

		mary (cont'd)
	oh, patrick, you didn't want any, did
	you?

		patrick
	nah, i don't know.

mary hands a glass to stan.  she holds hers up in a toast.

		mary
	blessed are the forgetful, for they get
	the better even of their blunders.

mary and stan click glasses.

		mary (cont'd)
	nietzsche.  beyond good and evil.  found
	it my bartletts.

		stan
	that's a good one.

		mary
	yeah, i can't wait to tell howard!  it
	seems really appropriate.

		stan
		(a little sulky)
	it's a good one all right.

		patrick
	what's your bartlett's?

		stan
	it's a quote book.

		mary
	i love quotes.  so did winston churchill.
	he actually has a quotation in bartlett's
	about bartlett's.  isn't that trippy?

		patrick
		(trying to engage)
	yeah.  cool.

		mary
	"the quotations when engraved upon the
	memory give you good thoughts."

		patrick
	very cool.  trippy.

		mary
	i like to read what smart people say.  so
	many beautiful, important things.

		stan
	yup.

		mary
	don't you think howard's like that?
	smart?  important?

		stan
		(beat)
	yup.

		patrick
	definitely!

		mary
	i think he'll be in bartlett's one day.

stan focuses on the monitor.  mary pours herself another
drink.

		patrick
	definitely.
