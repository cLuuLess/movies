int. waiting room - day

it's modern and well-appointed.  the old woman enters, sits
behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the
drawer.   she takes some pills with water.  an old man
enters.

		old man
	how are you today, mary?

		old woman (mary)
	let's see... still dying, howard.

		old man (howard)
	you don't have to jump down my throat.  i
	was trying to be nice.

		old woman (mary)
	well, don't try.  it's unbecoming on you.

old howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
old mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  we watch the
color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
another old woman enters the office.  old mary looks up,
seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.

		old woman (mary) (cont'd)
	may i help you?

		second old woman
	i'd like to make an appointment.

		old woman (mary)
	i think the doctor is free this morning.
	he can probably take you right away for
	an initial consultation.

the second old woman smiles gratefully.
