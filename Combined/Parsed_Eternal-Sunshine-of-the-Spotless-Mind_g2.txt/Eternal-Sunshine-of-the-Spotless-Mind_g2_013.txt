int. train - a bit later

joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain.  after a moment the door
between cars opens and clementine enters.  joel looks up.
clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
where to sit.  she settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car.  joel looks out the window.  he feels her watching
him.  the train is picking up speed.  finally:

		clementine
		(calling over the rumble)
	hi!

joel looks over.

		joel
	i'm sorry.

		clementine
	why?

		joel
	why what?

		clementine
	why are you sorry?  i just said hi.

		joel
	no, i didn't know if you were talking to
	me, so...

she looks around the empty car.

		clementine
	really?

		joel
		(embarrassed)
	well, i didn't want to assume.

		clementine
	aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  take the
	leap and assume someone is talking to you
	in an otherwise empty car.

		joel
	anyway.  sorry.  hi.

clementine makes her way down the aisle towards joel.

		clementine
	it's okay if i sit closer?  so i don't
	have to scream.  not that i don't need to
	scream sometimes, believe me.
		(pause)
	but i don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to write or something.

		joel
	no, i mean, i don't know.  i can't really
	think of much to say probably.

		clementine
	oh.  so...

she hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
came from.

		joel
	i mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
	here.  i didn't mean to --

		clementine
	no, i don't want to bug you if you're
	trying to --

		joel
	it's okay, really.

		clementine
	just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
	i have a long trip ahead of me.
		(sits across aisle from joel)
	how far are you going?  on the train, i
	mean, of course.

		joel
	rockville center.

		clementine
	get out!  me too!  what are the odds?

		joel
	the weirder part is i think actually i
	recognize you.  i thought that earlier in
	the diner.  that's why i was looking at
	you.  you work at borders, right?

		clementine
	ucch, really?  you're kidding.  god.
	bizarre small world, huh?  yeah, that's
	me: book slave there for, like, five
	years now.

		joel
	really?  because --

		clementine
	jesus, is it five years?  i gotta quit
	right now.

		joel
	-- because i go there all the time.  i
	don't think i ever saw you before.

		clementine
	well, i'm there.  i hide in the back as
	much as is humanly possible.  you have a
	cell phone?  i need to quit right this
	minute.  i'll call in dead.

		joel
	i don't have one.

		clementine
	i'll go on the dole.  like my daddy
	before me.

		joel
	i noticed your hair.  i guess it made an
	impression on me, that's why i was pretty
	sure i recognized you.

		clementine
	ah, the hair.
		(pulls a strand in front of her
		 eyes, studies it)
	blue, right?  it's called blue ruin.  the
	color.  snappy name, huh?

		joel
	i like it.

		clementine
	blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
	wondering.

		joel
	yeah.  tom waits says it in --

		clementine
	exactly!  tom waits.  which song?

		joel
	i can't remember.

		clementine
	anyway, this company makes a whole line
	of colors with equally snappy names.  red
	menace, yellow fever, green revolution.
	that'd be a job, coming up with those
	names.  how do you get a job like that?
	that's what i'll do.  fuck the dole.

		joel
	i don't really know how --

		clementine
	purple haze, pink eraser.

		joel
	you think that could possibly be a full
	time job?  how many hair colors could
	there be?

		clementine
		(pissy)
	someone's got that job.
		(excited)
	agent orange!  i came up with that one.
	anyway, there are endless color
	possibilities and i'd be great at it.

		joel
	i'm sure you would.

		clementine
	my writing career!  your hair written by
	clementine kruczynski.
		(thought)
	the tom waits album is rain dogs.

		joel
	you sure?  that doesn't sound --

		clementine
	i think.  anyway, i've tried all their
	colors.  more than once.  i'm getting too
	old for this.  but it keeps me from
	having to develop an actual personality.
	i apply my personality in a paste.  you?

		joel
	oh, i doubt that's the case.

		clementine
	well, you don't know me, so... you don't
	know, do you?

		joel
	sorry.  i was just trying to be nice.

		clementine
	yeah, i got it.

there's a silence.

		clementine (cont'd)
	my name's clementine, by the way.

		joel
	i'm joel.

		clementine
	no jokes about my name?  oh, you wouldn't
	do that; you're trying to be nice.

		joel
	i don't know any jokes about your name.

		clementine
	huckleberry hound?

		joel
	i don't know what that means.

		clementine
	huckleberry hound!  what, are you nuts?

		joel
	i'm nut nuts.

		clementine
		(singing)
	oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
	darlin' clementine?  no?

		joel
	sorry.  it's a pretty name, though.  it
	means "merciful", right?

		clementine
		(impressed)
	yeah.  although it hardly fits.  i'm a
	vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

		joel
	see, i wouldn't think that about you.

		clementine
		(pissy)
	why wouldn't you think that about me?

		joel
	oh.  i don't know.  i was just... i don't
	know.  i was... you seemed nice, so --

		clementine
	now i'm nice?  don't you know any other
	adjectives?  there's careless and snotty
	and overbearing and argumentative...
	mumpish.

		joel
	well, anyway... sorry.

they sit in silence for a while.

		clementine
	i just don't think "nice" is a
	particularly interesting thing to be.

the conductor enters the car.

		conductor
	tickets.

joel hands the conductor his ticket.  the conductor punches
it and hands it back.

		clementine
	what is nice, anyway?  i mean, besides an
	adjective?  i guess it can be an adverb,
	sort of.

the conductor turns to clementine.  she fishes in her bag.

		clementine (cont'd)
	it doesn't reveal anything.  nice is
	pandering.  cowardly.

		clementine (cont'd)
	and life is more interesting than that.
	or should be.  jesus god, i hope it is...
	someday.
		(to conductor)
	i know it's here.

the conductor and joel watch as she gets more agitated.

		clementine (cont'd)
	i don't need nice.  i don't need myself
	to be it and i don't need anyone else to
	be it at me.

		joel
	okay.

		clementine
	shit.  shit.  i know it's here.  hold on.

she dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
frantically through.  joel sees the book she was reading in
the diner.  it's the play by stephen dixon.

		clementine (cont'd)
	damn it.  damn it!
		(there it is)
	oh.  here.

she hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  he
punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.

		conductor
	next stop southampton.

the conductor heads into the next car.  clementine shoves
stuff back into her purse.  her hands are a little shaky.
she pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
opens it, and downs it.  joel is watching all of this but
pretending not to.  she looks out the window for a while.
the train pulls into the station.  the doors open.  nobody
gets on.  the doors close.  the train pulls out.

		clementine
	joel?  it's joel, right?

		joel
	yes?

		clementine
	i'm sorry i... yelled at you.  was it
	yelling?  i can't really tell.  whatever,
	i'm a little out of sorts today.

		joel
	that's okay.

		clementine
		(stares out window)
	my embarrassing admission is i really
	like that you're nice.  right now,
	anyway.  i can't tell from one moment to
	the next what i'm going to like.  but
	right now i'm glad you said, "that's
	okay" to me.  that was nice of you.

		joel
	it's no problem.  anyway, i have some
	stuff i need to --

		clementine
	oh, okay.  well, sure, i'll just...
		(stands, throws bag over
		 shoulder)
	take care, then.

		joel
		(pulling journal from
		 briefcase)
	probably see you at the book store.

		clementine
		(heading toward other end of
		 car)
	unless i get that hair-color-naming job.

clementine sits and stares out the window.
