ext. charles river - night

clementine and patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
and look up at the night sky.

		patrick
	i could die right now, clem.  i'm just
	happy.  i've never felt that before.  i'm
	just exactly where i want to be.

clementine looks over at him.  their eyes meet.  she sobs.

		clementine
	i want to go home.

she hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
continues, now running.
