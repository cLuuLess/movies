int. joel's apartment - day

namoi is red-eyed from crying.  she is packing things in
boxes.  joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
to say.  she holds up a book.  the scene starts to fade.

		naomi
	yours?

		joel
	you take it.  i don't know.

she tosses it in a box.

		joel (cont'd)
	naomi, i really value our relationship.
	i hope it's possible for us to stay in
	touch.

		naomi
	don't do this to me now, joel.  really.
