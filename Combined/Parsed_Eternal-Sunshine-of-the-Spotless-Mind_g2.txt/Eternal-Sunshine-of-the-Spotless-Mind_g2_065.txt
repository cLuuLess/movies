int. clementine's apartment - continuous

clementine watches out the window as patrick nears.  she's
crying.  he makes his way up her front stairs.  she swings
open the door and hugs him.

		patrick
	oh, baby, what's going on?

		clementine
	i don't know.  i'm lost.  i'm scared.  i
	feel like i'm disappearing.  i'm getting
	old and nothing makes any sense to me.

		patrick
	oh, tangerine.

		clementine
	nothing makes any sense.  nothing makes
	any sense.

she pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at patrick.

		clementine (cont'd)
	come up to boston with me?

		patrick
	sure.  we'll go next weekend and --

		clementine
	now.  now!  i have to go now.  i have to
	see the frozen charles!  now!  tonight!

		patrick
	um, okay.  i'll call my study partner.

		clementine
	yay!  it'll be great!  i'll get my shit.

she runs into the bedroom.  patrick is at the phone and
realizes he doesn't know joel's number.  after a moment's
thought, he *69's.  the phone rings.

		joel's voice
	hi, it's joel.  please leave a message
	after the beep.

beep.

		patrick
		(whisper)
	stan, it's patrick.  pick up.

		stan's voice
	hey, where are you?

		patrick
	i got into a situation with the old lady.
	can you handle things tonight alone?  i'm
	really sorry, man.
