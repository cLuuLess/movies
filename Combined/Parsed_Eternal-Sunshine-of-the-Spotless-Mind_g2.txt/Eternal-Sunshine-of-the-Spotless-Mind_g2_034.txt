int. mierzwiak's office - day

joel and mierzwiak are in the sitting area.  joel looks at
the tape recorder.

		mierzwiak
	i'm sorry you saw one of our notification
	cards.  you never should have.

		joel
	well... i did.

		mierzwiak
	we can help you through this.  why don't
	you start now by telling me everything
	you can remember about your relationship
	with clementine.

		joel
		(thinks, then:)
	it was a mess.  i don't know how it got
	this way...

		patrick's voice
	it's kind of a dump, don't you think?

joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.
