int. publishing house reception area - day

it's grand and modern.  random house-knopf-taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters.  an old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  she
seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  the young receptionist,
dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.

		receptionist
	oh, hi.

		old woman
		(apologetically)
	hi, i was in the neighborhood and thought
	i'd see --

		receptionist
	i think he's in a conference.
	unfortunately.  i'm really sorry.

		old woman
	would you just try him?  you never know.
	as long as i'm here.  you never know.

		receptionist
	of course.  please have a seat.

the old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
lap.  she stares politely straight ahead.

		receptionist (cont'd)
		(quietly into headset)
	it's her -- i know, but couldn't you just
	-- yes, i know, but -- i know, but she's
	old and it would be a nice -- yes, sorry.
		(to old woman)
	i'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
	it's a crazy time of year for us.

the receptionist gestures toward a christmas tree in the
corner.  its ornaments are holograms.

		old woman
	this book -- it's essential that people
	read it because --
		(gravely, patting the
		 manuscript)
	-- it's the truth.  and only i know it.

		receptionist
		(nodding sympathetically)
	maybe after the holidays then.
