int. mierzwiak's office - moments later

stan enters.  mierzwiak is pale and pacing.

		mierzwiak
	she should not have done this, stan.  as
	mad as she was... as justifiably --

		stan
	i don't know what you're talking about,
	howard.

		mierzwiak
	mary has stolen our files and is sending
	them back to people.

		stan
	jesus.

mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
looking in on the lab, where patrick has clearly taken over
stan's position.  he is in the process of interviewing a sad
young woman.

		young woman
	... so i called everybody i know and
	asked them to tell me everything.  now i
	know my entire history with him, but it's
	in the form of a story, i'm losing my
	mind.

		mierzwiak
	this is why people must never be told.
	it's like waking a --

		young woman
	i don't know what to do.  before i
	thought i was depressed for no reason.
	now it's like i've been assigned a
	reason.

		patrick
	this never should've happened, ma'am.
	we'll take care of it.

		mierzwiak
	i know you don't like me much, stan, but
	please talk to mary.  she of all people
	should know this is a dangerous thing
	she's doing.
