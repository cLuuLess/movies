int. clementine's apartment - later

joel and clementine review their separate lacuna packages
together.

		clementine
	says you were closed off, non
	communicative, never told me what you
	were feeling.

		joel
	says you were a bully...

		clementine
		(laughing)
	a bully?  moi?

		joel
	that's what it says.  you drank too much,
	you picked on me for being passive and
	timid.

		clementine
	well, sounds like me.  sorry, man.
		(reading)
	says you were jealous and suspicious.

		joel
	says you would sometimes disappear all
	night, then brag to me about your sexual
	conquests.

		clementine
	did i use the term "sexual conquests" or
	is that your way of putting it.

		joel
	i don't know.

		clementine
	doesn't sound like me.

		joel
	says you were a slob, leaving trails of
	panties and dirty socks in your wake.

		clementine
	says you were constantly calling me a
	slob.
		(laughs)
	it's sexy that we were like a married
	couple, griping and overly-familiar and
	bored.  don't you think?

		joel
		(considering)
	i sort of do.  but i only see it as a
	fantasy version of reality.  cleaned up
	enough to be erotic.

		clementine
	we should have sex.  it's old hat for us.

she smiles at nervous joel.

		clementine (cont'd)
	you know my body like the back of your
	hand.

she unbuttons her blouse.

		clementine (cont'd)
	every curve, every freckle.

she takes off her shirt.  he stares at her.  he has clearly
never seen this body before.

		joel
	you're so beautiful.

she approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
waist for the first time.
