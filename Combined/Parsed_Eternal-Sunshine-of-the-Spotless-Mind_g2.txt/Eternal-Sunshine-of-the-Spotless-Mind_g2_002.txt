int. tiled hallway - day

the old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall.  she stops to catch her breath, then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them.  when
she arrives at one topped by an ll, she slips a card in a
slot.  a plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  she
sits in the chair; it rises.
