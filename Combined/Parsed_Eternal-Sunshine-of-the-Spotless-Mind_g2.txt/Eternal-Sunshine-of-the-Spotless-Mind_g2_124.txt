int. house - continuous

joel enters the darkened and clementine closes the door
behind him.

		joel
	i knew.

		clementine
	i knew by your nervousness that naomi
	wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
	criminally trespass.

		joel
	it's dark.

		clementine
	yeah.  what's your girlfriend's name?

		joel
	naomi.

she's searching through drawers for something.  she pulls out
a flashlight, shines it in joel's face.

		clementine
	ah-ha!  now i can look for candles,
	matches, and the liquor cabinet.

		joel
	i think we should go.

		clementine
	no, it's our house!  just tonight --
		(looking at envelope on
		 counter)
	-- we're david and ruth laskin.  which
	one do you want to be?  i prefer to be
	ruth but i'm flexible.
		(opens cabinet)
	alcohol!  you make drinks.  i'm going
	find the bedroom and slip into something
	more ruth.  i'm ruthless at the moment.

she runs upstairs, giggling.  the room is drying out, turning
into a husk.

		joel
		(calling after her)
	i really should go.  i really need to
	catch my ride.

		voice-over
	i didn't want to go.  i was too nervous.
	i thought, maybe you were a nut.  but you
	were exciting.  you called from upstairs.

		clementine (cont'd)
		(flat)
	so go.

		joel
	i did.  i walked out the door.  i felt
	like i was a scared little kid.  i
	thought you knew that about me.  i ran
	back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
	humiliation.  you said, "so go" with such
	disdain.

		clementine (cont'd)
		(poking her head downstairs)
	what if you stay this time?

		joel
	i walked out the door.  there's no more
	memory.

		clementine
	come back and make up a good-bye at
	least.  let's pretend we had one.

clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
way through the decaying environment.

		clementine (cont'd)
	bye, joel.

		joel
	i love you.

she smiles.  they kiss.  it fades.

		clementine
	i --
