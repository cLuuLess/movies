int. joel's apartment - night

joel sits in the quiet living room.  the scene is fading.

	naomi.

		voice-over
	on the couch.  dark.  quiet.  i wondered
	if i had made a terrible mistake.  i
	almost reached for the phone about a
	thousand times.  i thought i could take
	it back, erase it, explain i had
	momentarily lost my mind. then i told
	myself we weren't happy.  that was the
	truth.  that what we were was safe.
	it was unfair to you and to me to stay in
	a relationship for that reason.  i
	thought about clementine and the spark
	when i was with her, but then i thought
	what you and i had was real and adult and
	therefore significant even if it wasn't
	much fun.   but i wanted fun.  i saw
	other people having fun and i wanted it.
	then i thought fun is a lie, that no one
	is really having fun; i'm being suckered
	by advertising and movie bullshit... then
	i thought maybe not, maybe not.  and then
	i thought, as i always do at this point
	in my argument, about dying.
