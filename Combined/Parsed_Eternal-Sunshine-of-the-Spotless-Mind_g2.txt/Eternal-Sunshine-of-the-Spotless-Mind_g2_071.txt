ext. forest - day

joel and clementine are hiking, clementine in front.

		clementine
	such a beautiful view.

		joel
		(looking at her)
	yes indeed.
		(snapping out of memory)
	fuck!  they're erasing you, clem!

		clementine
	oh?

		joel
	i hired them to.  we're in my brain.  but
	i want it to stop, before i wake up and
	don't know you anymore.

		clementine
	wow.  um, well... can't you just force
	yourself awake?

		joel
	i don't know.

he concentrates.  nothing happens.

		joel (cont'd)
	aaargh!  it's horrible!  i'm trapped!

he starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
feet, screaming.  but even while he's doing this the memory
and clementine are fading around him.
