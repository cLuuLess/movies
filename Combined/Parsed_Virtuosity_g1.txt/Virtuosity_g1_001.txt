ext. downtown street
1
two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street.
hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban
jungle.
the sidewalk is crowded with people.  so is the street.
too many people, not enough cement.  los angeles, 1997.
summer, probably august.  103 degrees.  heat shimmers off
the horizon.  making the sky look peculiar.
the men keep running.  past a guy sitting at a bus stop,
watching a television in his lap.  you hear the newscaster.
newscaster (v.o.)
as l.a.p.d. officers gather
evidence at this grisly crime
scene, you can only ask yourselves
-- what kind of lunatic would
commit such unthinkable crimes?
(a beat)
the three adjectives which best
describe this killer are sadistic,
intelligent, and dangerous...
the guy pays little little attention to the broadcast.  he
seems almost bored by it.  like this kind of news is com-
monplace.  or he's got more important things on his mind.
everybody is sweating.  including the two men struggling
to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians.
their uniforms are freshly pressed.  their shoes just
recently shined.  hair tightly cropped.  faces perfect-
ly shaved.  clearly men proud to wear the badge of the
los angeles police department.  the guy in the lead is
parker barnes
his body is a running back's.  his endurance a mara-
thoner's.  his face one you'd want for your own.  he's
in his 30s.  if he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous.
his partner is john donley, late 20s, eager to prove
himself.  he struggles to keep up with parker.  john ac-
cidently knocks over several pedestrains.  they give no
reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on
their way.
parker and john keep charging.  their conversation breath-
less:

i can't get over how different you
look.
parker
(ruefully)
five years can be a bitch, huh?
john
five years ago, i'd already been
in two.
(a beat)
you sure you know where you're
going?
parker
trust me -- i'm a cop.
