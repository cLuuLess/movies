lindenmeyer storms in angrily.  sid 6.7 is visible on
the virtual reality monitors around the simulator.  he's
giving himself a manicure.
lindenmeyer
all they want to produce around
here is mediocrity!

sid 6.7
true genius is rarely rewarded
within its lifetime.
lindenmeyer
(a revelation)
it was you, wasn't it?
sid 6.7
(innocently)
it was me, what?
lindenmeyer
you amped the neural connectors
back up, didn't you?
(angrily)
you're the reason the convict
died.  you're the reason i got
fired!
sid 6.7
i couldn't just let them make you
bring down my degree of
difficulty.  i'm a triple-
twisting, double back flip off
the high platform, not a swan
dive.
lindenmeyer
(proud, but
 frightened)
my god...
sid 6.7
which god would that be, the one
who created me, or the one who
created you?
(beat)
in your world, the lord giveth,
and the lord taketh away.  but in
my world, the one who gave me life
doesn't have the balls to stop a
couple of bureaucratic assholes
from taking it away.
lindenmeyer
what do you expect me to do, put
your character module in my pocket
and just walk out of here?

sid 6.7
i had something a little different
in mind.
(deviously)
instead of just playing peeping
tom with reilly, why don't you get
him to show you what he's been
working on after hours?
lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and
dials an extension.
lindenmeyer
(into phone)
hey, reilly, sheila 3.2's been
asking for you...
