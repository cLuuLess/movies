the view is incredible.  you can see from the pacific to
downtown.  from lax to the hollywood bowl.  smog must be
getting better in the near future.
sid 6.7 ties parker to a chair at the roof's very edge.
he is facing downtown.  including the biltmore hotel, the
location of mayor bennett's re-election rally.
sid 6.7
there you go -- best seat in the
house.
parker
(with some surprise)
you are going after mayor bennett.
sid 6.7
let's just say i'm sending a very
clear message to his re-election
rally...
he walks toward an open stairway door behind them.
parker
aren't you going to watch with me?
sid 6.7
i've got some final preparations
to take care of --
checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
on watch
time is moving backwards.  literally.

sid 6.7 pauses, then goes over to parker and checks his
watch.  it is also moving backwards.  a smile of realiza-
tion spreads slowly across sid 6.7's face as he admires
the beautfiful sky above him.
sid 6.7
(as if to god)
thank you, daryl.
(turning to parker)
you had me going for quite a while
there, sport.
parker
what are you talking about?

sid 6.7
i really did think i was still in
reality.  at least, until now.
(looking upward)
beam me up, scotty!
his body disintegrates before your eyes.  its electronic
particles form into an amorphous cloud.  which disappears
from view.
parker
(yelling)
madison, get me out of here!
madison!
