int. madison's bedroom
81
madison enters wearily, late afternoon.  exhausted from
the events of the last two days, she starts to undress.
her clothing is filthy.  so is her skin.  she could use
a good shower, and a better massage.
madison examines the various cuts and bruises she's re-
ceived along the way.  not exactly war wounds, but to
somebody used to sitting behind a desk, they are.
she absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes
into her bathoom.  madison looks at her face in the
mirror.  she's looked batter.  after splashing cold
water on her face, she comes to the same conclusion.
madison takes two aspirin.  and then two more.  wishing
they would take effect immediately.  finally hearing the
news on the tv, her entire demeanor changes instantly.
madison rushes in front of the television to see a report
of parker's escape from the prison transport.
madison
oh, shit!
grabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the
door.
