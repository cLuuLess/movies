dozens of tvs on display.  there is a different channel on
each.  the audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming.
sid 6.7 enters, making his way to a big screen tv with
the local news in progress.
reporter #2 (v.o.)
... commuters travelling anywhere
near the biltmore hotel downtown
tomorrow evening should allow
themselves at least 30 extra
minutes to get home.  security for
mayor bennett's re-election rally
is going to be so tight that all
bus and subway routes passing
through the area are being
re-routed...
sid 6.7 changes the channel to a different news broad-
cast.  parker's folsom county prison i.d. photograph is
shown alongside a photograph of madison from one of her
book covers.
sid 6.7
(to the tv)
don't you two make a pretty
couple.
the news broadcast zooms in on parker's picture.
sid 6.7 wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his
face.
sid 6.7
we really do have so much in
common.  but i refuse to be
upstaged...
he changes the channel back to the first news broadcast.
a reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where
sid 6.7 had terrified the patrons.
sid 6.7 turns to the other customers in the store.  most
of them are watching other channels.  he goes over to a
control pad on a counter and presses several buttons.
now every tv in the store has the news with the reporter
outside the bar on.  a skinhead, sporting numerous nazi
swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of
the tv to a dodger baseball game.
sid 6.7 walks over to the skinhead and changes the
channel back to the news.
skinhead
you don't wanna fuck with me, man.

he moves to the next tv over and changes the channel to
the baseball game.  sid 6.7 moves over with him, stand-
ing directly behind the skinhead as if also interested in
the dodgers.
sid 6.7
(singing softly)
take me out to the ball game...
take me out for the fun...
he places his hands on the skinhead's head and
efficiently snaps his head around, breaking his neck.
sid 6.7
buy me some peanuts and cracker
jacks... i don't care if i ever
come back...
he drops the skinhead to the floor, never once taking his
eyes off the tv.
on tv
a dodger game is in progress.  a pop fly is caught by
the center fielder.  the runner at third tags and heads
for home.  the play at the plate is close.  the umpire
calls the runner out.
the camera pans to the massive screen over left field to
show the instant replay.  reactions of the fans around
the stadium are shown in closeup.  the fans also respond
to seeing themselves on the massive screen.

sid 6.7 watches the tv intently, completely ignoring the
horrified customers circling around him because of the
dead skinhead at his feet.  a salesman, who'd been
demonstrating a videocamera, tapes sid 6.7 from behind a
customer.
salesman's pov - handheld video
as sid 6.7 realizes he's being videotaped, his entire
face seems to light up.  playing directly to the camera,
he clearly loves being in the spotlight.  the attention.
the focus.  it's suddenly as if he's had years of
training.  he is completely at ease.  and simply
captivating.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
(direct address)
i'm sorry i can't do more for you.

sid 6.7 (v.o.) (cont'd)
(pointing to
 the skinhead)
public service really isn't my
forte.
he walks into an extreme closeup and kisses the lens.
then reaches out of frame to help the increasingly shaky
salesman steady the camera.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
but rest assured...
(a beat)
a star is born.
