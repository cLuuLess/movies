is hidden.  cox and deane look on.

deane

madison
ms. deane, you wanted to see me?
deane
we have an emergency situation
which requires somebody with
expertise in criminal psychology.
under the authority vested in me
by the president, i'm giving you
temporary re-assignment.
madison
what's the assignment?
deane
you're going to put your theories
to practice.  i'm sending you into
the field.
the barber moves back from parker, revealing his clean-
shaven face.  it takes madison a moment to recognize
him with his cleaned-up appearance.
madison
(double-taking him)
quite an improvement.
(looking him over)
hair well above the collar --
standard, l.a.p.d. regulation.
(suspiciously to
 deane)

doing in the field?
