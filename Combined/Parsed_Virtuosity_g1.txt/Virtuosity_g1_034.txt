every device imagineable.  parker and madison survey the
scene with nothing but their eyes.
lying in the middle of the living room are the four
victims:  the affluent couple and the first two cops to
arrive.  their bodies were left in similar condition to
reilly's.  except their heads have been interchanged.
parker and madison turn their attention to a message writ-
ten in blood on a wall.  it reads:  death to the pigs.
madison
(knowledgeably)
he was re-enacting charles manson's
labianca murders.
parker
manson didn't kill the first cops
to arrive on the scene.
madison
whoever did this wanted to do
charlie one better -- to improve
upon what was already done.
parker
charlie!  you say that like
you're close, personal friends.
madison
i've spent over 50 hours
interviewing him.

seeing the blood bath on

them how it should be done.
