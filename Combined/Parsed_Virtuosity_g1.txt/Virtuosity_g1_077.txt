a guy in dodger baseball cap and jacket.  walking calmly
away from the stadium.  he descends down an escalator
into a recently-built subway station.  it is sid 6.7.
parker
charges after him.  a heat-seeking missile locked on

she does the best she can to follow after him.  people
knock into parker as hard as he does them.  a human
