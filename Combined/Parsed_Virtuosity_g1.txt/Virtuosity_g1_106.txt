sight.  looking for just an inch of him to stick out
from behind madison's terrified face.

sid 6.7
(to parker)
i wouldn't pull the trigger if i
were you --
parker
why's that?
cox advances toward sid 6.7 from the side of the bridge.
cox's gun out and ready.  his finger on the trigger.
cox
hey, sid, what were you planning
on doing with the c-4?
sid 6.7 turns his head in surprise toward cox as a rifle
is fired in the distance.  cox steps directly in the
sniper's line-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for
parker through the chest.  cox drops to the bridge.
parker
nooooooo!!!
he rushes to cox.  parker drops to his knees, cradling
cox's head.  cox is not long for this earth.  looking up
to parker, he tries to talk.  but nothing comes out.
parker
(compassionately)
don't worry, i know.  i know.
cox's eyes roll back in his head.  parker then closes them
and gently lays his head on the sidewalk.
parker turns his head toward sid 6.7, who's released
madison and is jumping over a railing to the street 20
feet below.  parker rushes to the railing.
