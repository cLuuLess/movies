which is also the highest, sid 6.7 veers out of view.
parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor.
sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen.
parker searches methodically.  efficiently.  he finally
spots sid 6.7.  who has parker's head lined-up perfectly
in his gun-sight.  parker is a sitting duck.  boom!
parker dives behind affluent shopper 2.1, who takes a
bullet in his ascot.  parker quickly grabs him, and uses
his body as a shield against sid 6.7's constant gunfire
until parker arrives behind a marble column.
sid 6.7
(surprised at
 parker's
 ruthlessness)
we really aren't that different,
are we?
what he cannot see is that behind the column, affluent
shopper 2.1 is auto resetting.  parker puts his gun to
the shopper's head.
parker
(whispering)
don't move, and don't make a
sound.  got it?
affluent shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly.  parker
collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from
behind it.  firing in sid 6.7's direction.  each bullet
finds its mark.
absorbing the blows, sid 6.7 backs up againt the atrium
railing.  taking one final shot, he falls backward.  over
the railing.
