sid 6.7 remains visible on the various monitors around
the room as lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
(from the monitors)
don't be angry with me, daryl.
lindenmeyer
(beat)
did you recognize the son-of-a-
bitch who got away?
sid 6.7
should i have?
lindenmeyer
think hard -- it'll come to you...
wallace enters briskly.

wallace
you embarrassed me in front of the
highest-ranking law enforcement
official in the country.
(beat)
do you have any idea how much
money you just cost me?
lindenmeyer
the reason you insisted on testing
my system with prisoners is
because of the increased risks
involved with increased realism.
wallace
of the six prison inmates you've
tested -- all of whom have had at
least some military or survival
training -- only mr. barnes is
still breathing.
lindenmeyer
i'm still making adjustments...
wallace
you've had a year-and-a-half to
make all the adjustments you want,
lindenmeyer.
(moving closer)
elizabeth deane does not give
second chances.  neither do i.
you're fired.
lindenmeyer
(hysterical)
i'm what?!
wallace
(relishing his
 authority)
you are to turn over the sid 6.7
program, and all its
documentation, for immediate
destruction.  is that understood?
lindenmeyer
(restraining himself)
i understand... i understand
perfectly.
wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door.  on the
monitors, sid 6.7 starts walking toward you.  into a
closeup.

sid 6.7 (v.o.)
(from the monitor)
hey, wallace, you really think you
can shut me down?
wallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief.
wallace
(to lindenmeyer)
how does he know who i am?
lindenmeyer
(pointing to
 microphone)
he hears... everything.
wallace
(approaching the
 monitor)
as a matter of fact, i do.
he exits.
on monitors
around the room, sid 6.7 walks to a pay phone and dials a
number.
