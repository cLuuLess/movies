int. lindenmeyer's duplex
31
madison races through the broken front door to find
parker checking his weapon.  before she can speak, he
motions for madison to freeze and be silent.
parker hears something.  something moving inside the
duplex.  his every movement is now that of a predator.
madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse.
she does not handle it with confidence.  parker shakes
his head.
madison
(quietly)
you've got a problem with me
carrying a gun?
parker
do me one favor -- if you shoot
at anything, make sure i'm
nowhere near it.
parker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms
furiously.  his movements are aggressive.  madison
searches other rooms methodically.  she is not timid.
just inexperienced in the field.
she passes a video camera mounted on a tripod.  pointed
out the window at a neighbor's bathroom.  dozens of
cassettes surround the tripod.  the labels are dated --
covering every day of the last month.

parker and madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen
with their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other.
madison puts down her gun.  parker does not.  the noise
persists.
parker
(looking through
 his sight)
bang...
he smiles wickedly, and continues on.  madison takes a
deep breath, then resumes her search.  parker and madison
end up --
