cox and deane watch the operation through a large window.
madison enters, carrying a folder labelled:  inmate
#673429 a/k/a parker barnes.  she withdraws several
photographs from the folder, placing the first one in
front of deane.
madison
this is parker barnes six years
ago.  the most decorated cop in
the history of l.a.p.d. special
investigations division...
the photograph is in black and white.  but as we move in
closer, it takes on color.  as well as comes to life, then
distorting.  becoming surreal.  resembling one of the
images from parker's cell.  then mutating into something
else.
intercut with:
parker's eyes
darting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues
dreaming.  you now realize you are seeing what he is
seeing:
flashes of color.  shapes.  mostly blurs.  a splash of
gold.  along with some yellow.  more images from parker's
cell.  both taking feminine form.  one adult, one child.
madison (v.o.)
this is parker with his wife and
daughter.  beautiful young
family, weren't they?
the bright colors melt into darker, more brooding images.
flashes of men's faces.  melting into urban decay.
unhappiness.  technology.
madison (v.o.)
this is the group of cyber
anarchists parker was closing in
on.

melancholy turns violent.  glimpses of weapons.  death.
explosions.  death.  blood.  death.  caskets.
tombstones.  images moving so fast, it's hard to tell
what they are.  nothing literal.
madison (v.o.)
this is what parker's wife and
daughter looked like after they
were kidnapped and executed.
weapons firing.  bombs exploding.  images of rage in all
its forms.  many of which you've already seen.  making one
thing now clear:  the paintings in parker's cell represent
his life.  what he was.  what he lost.  and what he is.
madison (v.o.)
this is what the cyber anarchists
and two people who just happened
to be in the wrong club at the
wrong time looked like after
parker finished with them.
tears.  hopelessness.  detonation.  and finally blackness.
complete and utter blackness.
cut to:
elizabeth deane
looking at the fifth photograph which madison has placed
in front of her inside the viewing room.
deane
(unfazed)
that's also where mr. barnes lost
his arms to mathew grimes' booby
trap.  what's your point, dr.
carter?
madison
(forcefully)
letting a lunatic like parker
barnes loose in the free world is
like lighting a fuse.  at some
point, he will go off -- you saw
what happened in the simulator.
the risk to the public is
unacceptably dangerous.
deane
not if you're with him every step
of the way.

the man played judge, jury, and
executioner with eight people's
lives.  he lost control and is
capable of doing it again.
deane
i understand the risks involved
here.  but there is nobody better
qualified to go after sid 6.7
than barnes.  and, there is nobody
who knows him better than you.
if a situation becomes volatile,
you will find a way to quell it.
i have complete confidence in you.
