parker's landing isn't pretty.  finally getting to his
feet, he sees the sid 6.7 character module is about to be
run over.
parker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself.
the approaching car screeches to a halt next to him.  it's
driven by lindenmeyer.  at gunpoint.  madison sits behind
him, her gun to his head.
wham!  the car behind them obviously wasn't prepared to
stop so quickly.  the bumpers of two cars are now inter-
twined.  neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon.
madison pulls lindenmeyer roughly out of the car.  she
drags him to parker, who is still on his knees, clutching
the sid 6.7 character module.  sirens approach in the
distance.
madison
(to parker)

parker
a bomb's going off tomorrow night,
but i have no idea where.
lindenmeyer
(a beat)
there is only one way to get any
more information out of sid 6.7...
they scan the area for a new mode of transport.  and
find one stopped at a dumpster down the block:  the
garbage truck.
