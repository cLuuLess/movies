int. parker's cramped prison cell
18
it's night.  light is dim.  his bed is empty.  the wall
next to it completely bare, except for the five christmas
cards sent each year by chief cox.
the other two walls in the cell, however, look very dif-
ferent.  they are completely covered with primitive
paintings -- darkly-colored, surreal images.  imagine the
lascaux cave paintings as works-in-progress.  painted by
dali.  except these images were created by parker barnes.
he kneels in a corner, working intensely on another
image.  completely lost in concentration.  his hands, his
clothing, covered in paint.  he almost appears to be part
of the artwork.
the work is intricate.  it clearly takes parker a very
long time.  which gives him something to do during the
nights he is unable to sleep.  which is most of them.
he is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to
the constant taunts echoing throughout the cell block.
threats of the ugliest, most vile kind.  the kind parker
has had to live with every night for the last five years.
pausing to admire his work, parker finally hears the
taunts.  his face becoming a mixture of frustration,
guilt, and anger.  parker immediately resumes painting.
