madison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and
hides.  she is still very dizzy.  and trying to keep
the sound of her breathing to a minimum.
sid 6.7 enters quietly.  a hunter on the prowl.  moving
very slowly.  then lunging very swiftly.  he continues
the hunt.
if madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer.  her
heart pounds.  her forehead perspires.  sid 6.7 is getting
closer.

sid 6.7 checks inside closets.  cabinets.   anywhere
large enough for a human being to fit.  he is practically
standing over her.  looking.  listening.
sid 6.7
how does it feel to know you're
going to die.  what are you
thinking about?
lights in the building suddenly come on.  several engi-
neers can be heard entering.  it's 8 a.m. -- the start of
a new day.  the facility is quickly becoming populated.
after giving one last look around, sid 6.7 reluctantly
gives up the hunt, and exits.  madison does not move until
she is certain sid 6.7 has left the building.

madison scrambles out of her hiding place.
