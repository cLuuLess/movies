int. prison cafeteria

parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates.  the
food is unrecognizable.  the air thick with humidity and
cigarette smoke.  nobody is talking.  just staring.  at
parker.
parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then
returns his utensils to a bin.  and heads to the bath-
room.  all eyes following parker's every move.
the other inmates then turn their attention to a man of
incredible size following parker.  6' 6", 225 lbs.  his
face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered
long ago.  this is big red.  he follows parker into the
bathroom.
