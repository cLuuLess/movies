ext. downtown street - madison
43
buying two coffees from a downtown street vendor.  she
returns to the squad car, which is barely moving.
traffic is at a near standstill because of an accident.
parker drinks his coffee black.  madison adds two creams,
two sugars.  the cackling from the police radio continues
unabated.
parker
i forgot what real coffee tastes
like...
madison
you know, considering you've only
been out of prison for seven
hours, you're re-adapting quite
well.
(a beat)
wait, i didn't mean that the way
it sounded.  i meant...
parker
don't worry about it, all right?
madison
dammit, i hate sounding so
clinical all the time.  all i
meant to say was i thought you
were doing well, but then i...
parker
relax.  i know what you meant.

madison
i ruin so many moments by
analyzing them when i should just
be living them.
parker
then why don't you start
practicing and keep your mouth
shut for a while?
madison stops herself from speaking.  it isn't easy for
her.  parker cracks a faint smile.  you hear the police
radio.
dispatcher (v.o.)
... report of a possible hostage
situation inside a bar on the
corner of figueroa and sixth.
description of the perp matches
the surveillance photographs from
letac taken this morning...
madison
that's only a couple blocks from
there.
parker
i'll meet you there.
tossing his coffee out the window, he opens the door.
madison
(deadly serious)
don't get out of the car.
parker
stop me.
he gets out, running down the sidewalk.  he flies past
the cars inching down the block.
madison
parker!  parker!
(a beat)
shit!
she climbs into the driver's seat, spilling hot coffee on
herself.
on sixth street
parker bolts recklessly through the downtown street.  a
hunter hot on the trail of his prey in an urban jungle.
