int. prison transport
parker goes absolutely berserk.  viciously punching the
steel mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin
on his knuckles is shredded.
parker
you... mother... fucker!  i'm
going to kill you!!!
sid 6.7
now, is that any way to talk to
an old buddy?  i mean, just
because i'm carrying around the
joy of killing your family inside
me doesn't mean we can't be
friends.
parker
grimes, you're dead!
he savagely hurls himself against his confines.  bone
vs. metal.  don't try this at home.
sid 6.7
i'm sorry, the party you're
trying to reach is not answering.
is there anyone else you would
like to talk to?
parker
dead!  you hear me?

you really are pathetic, you know
that?  mathew grimes is only one
letter in my alphabet.  he is
nothing compared to me.
parker is completely spent.  mentally and physically.  he
slumps in a corner.  out of breath.  bleeding.  sore.
all he can do is stare out through the portal's mesh at
sid 6.7.
sid 6.7
you could say thank you, you
know?  i'm giving you your
freedom, short-lived though it
may be.

a little-known fact about the
locater implants prison inmates
now receive upon release is that
they contain a pinhead capsule of
neural toxin.  the satellite they
use to track you can also trigger
release of the toxin with
microwaves.  after transmission,
the implant's host dies within 30
seconds.

it won't take long for them to
get your termination authorized
once they learn of your escape.
now who would you rather go
after, killer, them or me?
he releases the rear door lock.
