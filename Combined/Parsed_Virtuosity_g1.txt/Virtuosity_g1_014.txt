int. letac - next day

synthetic body parts laying strewn around one of the
stations in letac.  it's a good bet this is the same
technology attached to parker's elbows.
there are also various shapes and sizes of robots,
androids, and other synthetic forms.  the most human-
looking ones are the least functional.  the least human-
looking ones, the most functional.
you follow a remote-controlled, box-shaped robotic sentry
moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a
subway station.  it is being operated by clyde reilly,
20s, a hardware genius who has spent too much time in
windowless rooms.
hidden from reilly's view, lindenmeyer, the software
expert who created sid 6.7, stares jealously through a
narrow gap in a partition.  trying to contain his anger.
and failing.  especially as...
wallace enters the station, carrying a bottle of dom
perignon and two glasses.  wallace hugs reilly, who does
not return the gesture.

wallace
congratulations, reilly...
he pops the cork, and pours their glasses.
wallace
(toasting)
to the first letac engineer to go
into production on two prototypes.
reilly
as long as you keep overpaying me,
i'll be the first to go into
production on three, and four, as
well.
wallace
as long as they keep overpaying
me, i'll keep overpaying you.
(dropping the
 revelry)
just make goddam sure you can have
10 of them ready for deployment
around the city by next month.
reilly
mr. wallace, i could have 10 of
them ready by tomorrow.
wallace
(beat)
do they have to look so...
robotic?
reilly
at this stage, you either get form
or function.  you said she wanted
function.  i gave you function.
what are you complaining about?
he remote controls the robotic sentry to chase wallace
out of the station.  lindenmeyer can no longer be seen
through the gap in the partition.
