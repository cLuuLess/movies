int. l.a.p.d. headquarters - conference room
80
an aide rushes through the door to cox, who's briefing
deane and wallace on what he has learned.
aide
parker barnes just escaped from
the prison transport.  both of
the guards are dead.
the aide exits.
cox
(to deane)
barnes wouldn't kill two innocent
guards.
deane
he would slaughter eight people
sitting in a room, but not two
prison guards?
cox
do i need to remind you what
happened to his wife?  to his
daughter?
(with conviction)
i will stake my reputation that
barnes didn't kill those guards.
deane
you already have staked your
reputation.
(a beat)
mayor bennett and i have been
friends a long time.  since grimes
tried to kill him, it doesn't
take a rocket scientist to come
to the conclusion that sid 6.7
might go after him, too.
(a beat)
bennett's re-election rally is
tomorrow night and we already
have enough trouble on our hands
with one psychotic on the loose.
(to wallace)
the fail-safe on-line yet?
wallace
on-line and at your disposal.
cos
(to deane)
what fail-safe?
