madison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer.
via modem, she connects with the l.a.p.d. criminal
library.
she rifles through data concerning mathew grimes, who was
the leader of a cult of cyber anarchists.  he was known
as the charles manson of technological terrorism.

grimes was an expert at media manipulation.  he delighted
in publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way.  the
mayor of los angeles, bob bennett, who offered
increasingly higher rewards for grimes' capture, was
grimes' primary nemesis.
l.a.p.d. special investigations division officer parker
barnes managed to stop grimes from killing mayor bennett.
grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating parker with
false leads and lawsuits.
you see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley.  a
note is pinned to her clothing.  the note reads:  "hey,
parker, this one's for you."
grimes then kidnapped parker's wife and daughter.  parker
located the group in a club, but only in time to witness
their deaths.  parker then killed everybody in the club,
including the six cult members and two completely
innocent people.
madison stares gravely into the screen.

grimes, you better not be the
dominant.
