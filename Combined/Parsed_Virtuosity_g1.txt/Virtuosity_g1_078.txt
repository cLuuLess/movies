both.
he races down the tunnel to the north/south trains.
madison heads down the other.  her determination begin-
ning to win out over her inexperience.
parker
hesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound
side of the tracks.  further down the tunnel is the
escalator to the north-bound trains.  parker chooses
the escalator closest to him.

passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted
above them.  except for parker, who scans the crowd.
then across the tracks.
on north-bound platform
in the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching
the tv screen.  he is watching parker.  through his gun
sight.  sid 6.7 pulls the trigger.  boom!
on south-bound platform
parker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet.  he
scrambles behind a pillar for protection.  only to see
the guy standing behind him wasn't as lucky.
