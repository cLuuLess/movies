next morning
chief cox stares angrily at parker.  madison sits next
to him.  behind them is a mirrored wall.
cox
(reading from a list)
... illegal search of lindenmeyer's
duplex.  eleven civilian vehicles
damaged or destroyed.  twenty-four
citizen complaints.  and the calls
are just starting to come in...
(to parker)
i forgot what it's like to have
you on the streets.
madison
any sign of lindenmeyer?
cox
none.  he could be hiding, he
could be helping sid, or could be
in little pieces on santa monica
beach.
(a beat)
any idea what sid's going to do
next?
madison
until we know what new influences
are affecting him, we can't be sure.

cox

don't know shit.

wallace and deane look through the two-way mirror.
deane is on the phone.
wallace
(re:  parker)
it makes me nervous just seeing
him in a uniform.
(a beat)
i will never forget the first time
i saw the photographs from the
crime scene.
deane
(hanging up
 the phone)
neither will the public.
(a beat)
the media has caught wind of his
pardon.  unless mr. barnes starts
giving me some tangible results,
i'm going to put him back in his
cage.
