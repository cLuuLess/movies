lindenmeyer looks on with awe as sid 6.7 grows a new head
right before your eyes.  you've never seen anything like

sid 6.7

sid 6.7 wades through the trash toward lindenmeyer.
sid 6.7

bringing me back to life a second
time, daryl?
lindenmeyer

he reaches out to give lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him

sid 6.7
you made me a composite of 183 of
the most vicious people who ever
lived.
(a beat)
what do you think i'm doing?
lindenmeyer
i'm begging you... please don't
kill me!  please!
sid 6.7
(reasssuringly)
don't worry.  through me, you will
live forever...
