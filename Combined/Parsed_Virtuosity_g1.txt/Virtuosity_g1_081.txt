the college student standing in front of sid 6.7 gets
winged in the shoulder.  not a serious wound, but a
painful one just the same.

the bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon
impact, missing sid 6.7 entirely.
the student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain.
sid 6.7 crouches beside him.
sid 6.7
(yelling)
what's wrong, convict, your arms
need adjusting?  or maybe it's
your head.  maybe you aren't ready
to be back out in the real world,
yet...
parker's pov
the top of sid 6.7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two.
parker
fires again.  repeatedly.  moving closer and closer to
the edge of the platform, trying to get a better angle
while he still has a shot.
parker moves to the very edge of the platform.  his arm
extended out over it.  completely oblivious to...
subway train
rocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform.
madison
leaps off the descending escalator on the south-bound
side and rushes to parker.
she pulls parker back just before the train reaches him.
had his arm still been raised, parker would have lost
his arm a second time.
they tumble to the floor.  a passenger rushes to madison.
passenger #1
(pointing to parker)
lady, you gotta stop him!  he's
gone crazy!
passenger #2
he just shot an innocent bystander!
madison
(forcefully to parker)
what were you shooting at?

parker gets to his feet.  madison doesn't take her eyes
off him.
passenger #1

passenger #2
do something!
parker
(to madison)
sid's getting away.
he heads toward the up escalator.  his back now to madison.
she aims her gun at him.
madison
parker -- stop!  stop!  don't make
me shoot you --
parker
(not looking back)
if you're gonna do it, better do
it now.
he keeps right on going up the escalator.
madison
lines up her shot.  hands shaking.  with both fear and
determination.  her finger presses down on the trigger
... but she can't do it.
madison
dammit!
she chases after him.
