sid 6.7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young
woman sitting among several others.  you hear the sound
of tires screeching to a halt outside.
sid 6.7 remains unconcerned.  he toys with the woman,
pointing the gun in her face, then pulling it back.  her
expression changes instantly.  dramatically.
sid 6.7
i just love how responsive you
are.
cop #1 (o.s.)
freeze!
two cops stand in the doorway, weapons aimed at sid 6.7.
the cops inch closer to him.
sid 6.7
(not turning around)
the ushers were not supposed to
seat you until intermission.
cop #1
put the gun down, nice and...
sid 6.7 spins around and fires twice before he can
finish his sentence.  both cops receive identical wounds
in their shooting arms, reminding you of the wounds
parker and john first received in the opening virtual
reality sequence.
sid 6.7 takes a bow, as if on stage.
sid 6.7
thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
you've been a real pleasure...
as he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the
mirror behind the bar.  sid 6.7 has never seen his own
image in the real world before.  he likes what he sees.
