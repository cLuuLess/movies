int. law enforcement technology advancement center

a.k.a. letac.  the facility is a converted aerospace
research building in pacoima.  funded by government black
book dollars.
the look is a mixture of industrial grim and high-tech
sparkle.  banks upon banks of computer equipment.  wires,
cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.
in complete disarray to the uninitiated.  but to those
in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its
kind in the world.
the building is partitioned into dozens of stations.  at
each station, a leading engineer in his field is franti-
cally readying a prototype for demonstration.  each new
technology designed to help fight the new cold war...
the war on crime.
the atmosphere is competitive.  voices are loud.  tension,
anticipation in the air.  only a lucky few will have their
inventions approved for production.
letac is, quite simply, los alamos from 1940 meets sega
from 1994.
at a station in the middle of the room, two unconscious
bodies lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps
made of polyurethane.
each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through
it at points designated as neural primes.  each needle is
directly connected to the participant's nervous system.
the tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected com-
puters surrounding the beds.

each of these components isn't much to look at on its own.
but together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part
of something very new -- a revolutionary law enforcement
training device whose name you read:  virtual reality
criminal investigation simulator.
to be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed
involving parker, john, and sid 6.7 took place within
virtual reality, not the real world.
dozens of small character modules, similar to today's
nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into the system's
main console.
each of the modules bears a name and number, such as
maitre d' 1.7 and sheila 3.2.  there is no character ver-
sion number greater than 4.0.  until you see the module
labelled sid 6.7.
the simulation timer stops at:  17 hours, 52 minutes, ll
seconds.  a clock reads:  3:04:32 p.m.
four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual real-
ity monitors positioned around the station.  one of the
men wears an l.a.p.d. uniform.  his name is william cox,
40s.  his nameplate reads:  chief of police.
one of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor.
intently following the action on screen.  studying it
clinically.  her name is dr. madison carter, late 30s.
she is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take
a back seat to her intelligence.  she is one of the coun-
try's foremost authorities in criminal psychology.  her
concerns are empirical.  her quest is knowledge.  she has
little in common with the other observers.
the other man is frederick wallace, 50s, chairman and ceo
of letac.  expensive suit.  commanding, powerful.  but not
as commanding, or powerful, as elizabeth deane, 60s, the
presidentially-appointed crime czar.
elizabeth deane is solely responsible for the funds allo-
cated to letac.  as well as which prototypes will move on
to production.
deane
(quietly to wallace)
what did cox pull him out early
for?
wallace
barnes used to work for him when
he was still a cop in the field,
remember?

don't remind me.
lab assistant remove the polyurethane skull caps from
the two unconscious bodies.  the acupuncture needles
remain in the caps.  you can now see the faces of the
participants:  parker and john.
parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually
returns to consciousness.  he looks very different than
his virtual rendering:
his hair is long and ragged.  his face is unshaven.  a
scar across his cheek.  a hoop earring in one ear.  his
outfit a filthy prison uniform.
john's outfit matches parker's.  physically, he looks as
clean-cut as his virtual rendering.  except that he is
convulsing.  violently.
his flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus
around him.  like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure.
it's ugly.  frightening.
parker
(barely conscious)
somebody... do something!
two paramedics burst through the doors and rush to john.
the paramedics inject him.  fibrillate him.  repeatedly.
the simulator's designer, daryl lindenmeyer, 40s, high-
strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by
the equipment protectively.  he is far more concerned for
the safety of his machines than he is for john's life.
john's body goes limp.  his vital signs flat.  the para-
medics record the time of death and cover the body with a
sheet.  they begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.
deane
(annoyed to wallace)
what the hell happened?
wallace
(pointing to needles)
lindenmeyer developed neural
connectors that tap directly into
the nervous system.

wallace (cont'd)
if the simulator isn't calibrated
properly, experiencing death in
this level of vr is like
experiencing death within a dream.
the experience becomes real.
deane
(angrily)
simulations are supposed to give
participants practice in realistic,
dangerous scenarios while
protecting them from the risks
they are exposed to in the real
world.
wallace
(annoyed, to
 lindenmeyer)
i was assured the problem was
corrected.
lindenmeyer
i did fix it.  i told you i did.
i don't know why it happened again.
deane
again?
cox
(a beat)
my first two pairs of convicts
suffered the same fate.
deane
(coldly, to wallace)
why wasn't i told?
wallace
black book dollars, black book
operation.  you pay me for results,
not for how i get you there.
cox
(to deane)
i'll tell you one thing -- there
is no way in hell we should allow
any real officers to train in this
damn thing.

deane
then about all i've spent $37
million developing is a very
expensive way to control the
prison population.
after giving wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his
hand-stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-stud-
ded cufflinks, she exits.  wallace follows after her
quickly.  you now notice that the chair dr. madison carter
had occupied is now empty.  she left a while ago.
cox remains.  lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator
as if it were his child.  there are several scratches, but
no major damage.  he looks relieved.
parker
(struggling to sit up)
he... only had a year left on his
sentence.
lindenmeyer
(annoyed)
how much do you think i care?
parker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at
lindenmeyer.
lindenmeyer
(hysterical)
don't touch me!... don't touch me!!!
he flails his arms wildly.  nearly spasming.  this is
clearly a man who should never drink coffee.  two armed
guards, who've been standing in the background, pull
parker off lindenmeyer and throw him to the ground.
lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put
parker in handcuffs and leg chains.
cox
i'll walk him out.
the guards back off as cox helps parker to his feet.
cox
(to parker)
you all right?
parker
(still clearing his
 head)
why'd... you pull me out?

donley started experiencing the
attack for real.  if i hadn't
gotten you out, the same thing
would have happened to you.
(a beat)
you may not believe this, parker,
but i still consider us friends.
he helps parker toward the exit as he continues having
difficulty with his balance.
