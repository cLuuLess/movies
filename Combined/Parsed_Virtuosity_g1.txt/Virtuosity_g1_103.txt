sid 6.7 talks into the payphone.
sid 6.7
be a reporter -- figure it out for
yourself.  all i'm going to tell
you is that at 8:00 tomorrow night,
i will become legendary...
parker and madison
reach the top of the stairs.  sid 6.7 remains on the
phone, his back toward parker and madison.  they split-up,
winding their way through the crowd waiting for an
arriving bus.
as the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move
toward the opening doors.  obscurring parker's view of
the payphone.
parker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see sid
6.7 holding madison in front of him, his gun to her head.
parker trains his weapon at sid 6.7.  he doesn't have a
clean shot.
sid 6.7
(to parker)
brings back memories, doesn't it?
