parker races out the door.  boom!  that was left knee
cap.  he tumbles to the street.  his gun flying from his
hand.  parker crawls desperately toward his weapon.  but
not fast enough.  sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.
sid 6.7
so close, and yet, so far...
he kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his
gun at parker's head.
sid 6.7
it's really too bad you have to
miss the grand finale.
parker
i thought you liked me being in
the audience.  don't you want me
to see it?
sid 6.7 pauses to think about it.
sid 6.7
(considering the idea)
you know, i do want you to see it.
he shoots parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of
his legs useless.
sid 6.7
i want you to have a bird's eye
view...
