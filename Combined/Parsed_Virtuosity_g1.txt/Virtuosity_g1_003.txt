parker charges through sous chefs chopping vegetables,
who work undistracted.  the vegetables look plastic.
parker turns a corner, stopping fast.  at the other end
of the aisle stands sid 6.7, who presses his gun against
the head of a frightened busboy.  sid 6.7 holds the bus-
boy's body in front of his own as a shield.
parker
(to sid 6.7)
where's john?
sid 6.7
performing solo.
(a beat)
enjoying the concert so far?
advancing up the aisle, parker levels his gun at sid 6.7
with his good arm.  now, all work comes to a stop as the
sous chefs watch the showdown.
parker
recital's over, asshole.
he fires directly through the chest of the innocent busboy,
hitting sid 6.7.
the sous chefs gasp in horror as the busboy drops through
sid 6.7's grasp to the floor.  dead.
sid 6.7 stares at parker in disbelief.  blood is now vis-
ible flowing from a bullet hole in sid 6.7's shoulder,
which was caused by the same bullet.  sid 6.7's arm dan-
gles uselessly.  his gun lies on the floor.

sid 6.7
(surprised, but pleased)
you and me aren't so different,
after all...
parker agains pulls the trigger.  click.  click, click.
no bullets.
sid 6.7
like a violin without strings...
he takes off around the corner.  grabbing another clip
from inside his uniform, parker goes after him.  only to
stumble over something  sid 6.7's bowling bag.  blood
flows through its zipper.  you now realize the object
inside is not a bowling ball.
beside the bowling bag lies john's body, which is convul-
sing.  his hands have been tied to bare electrical wire.
john is being electrocuted.  parker kicks away the wires,
but not in time.
parker
shit!
he scans the room for sid 6.7.  parker has no idea sid 6.7
is standing directly behind him.  sid 6.7 grabs parker by
the throat.
sid 6.7
i told you i was going to perform
a new piece with you.  it's called,
'first you suffer, then you die.'
hope you like it.
parker gags, unable to breathe.  he then starts to dema-
terialize from within sid 6.7's grasp.
sid 6.7
(as if to god)
nooo!!!  you can't take him, yet.
i'm not finished!
john's body also de-materializes as parker disappears
entirely.
the blood seeping from sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and
starts retracting into his body.  along with his bone
fragments.  his shoulder is healing itself.  right before
your very eyes.  we pull back to reveal what you are see-
ing is:

on a monitor
the scene continues seamlessly.  sid 6.7's skin heals over
his shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
proper places.  no scar whatsoever.
his clothing also returns to perfect condition.  literally,
as good as new.  this is known as automatic resetting.
the previously dead busboy also auto. resets.  his wound
healing by itself.  we pull back further to reveal the
monitor is one of several.
