ext. madison's house
38
madison walks up the steps to the front porch.  she is
immediately intercepted by her daugher, karin, 7, who
bursts out the front door and leaps into her arms.
karin
mommy's home!  mommy's home!
karin's baby-sitter opens the door for madison as she
carries her daughter inside.
parker stares from squad car in surprise.  even dis-
belief.  he had no idea madison was a mother.
moments later, karin comes out and sits on the front
steps.  staring at parker.  with fascination.  curiosity.
wondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting
in a police car outside her house.  but not saying a
word.
parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conver-
sation with her.  a multitude of expressions passing over
his face as memories of his own daughter flash through
his mind.
