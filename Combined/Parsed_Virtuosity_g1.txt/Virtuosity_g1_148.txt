int. guest conductor dressing room
142
the door is opened by the guest conductor, who is dres-
sed in a tuxedo, as well as large earrings.  his hair is
long and red.  his complexion is pale, nearly white.
and his eyes are piercing green.  you might describe this
look as punk meets classical.
guest conductor
(annoyed beyond belief)
are you just going to stand there,
or do you want something?
shaking with concentration, sid 6.7 turns his hair red.
(nano-organisms can do this, as well as the following.)
he then grabs his hair and pulls it out, extending it to
the exact length of the guest conductor's.
sid 6.7 then changes his complexion to match the con-
ductor's.  as well as his eye color, the other facial
features.  the guest conductor can't believe his eyes.
by the time sid 6.7 is finished modifying himself, he
may not be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor,
but even his mother would have to look twice.
sid 6.7
it's show time.
he shoves the guest conductor back into his dressing
room.  sid 6.7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed
.38.  he slams the door behind him.
