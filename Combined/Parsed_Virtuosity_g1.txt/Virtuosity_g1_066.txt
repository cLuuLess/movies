int. electronic store - one hour later
58
we pull back to reveal you're now watching a recording
of sid 6.7 on videotape, along with parker, madison,
and a dozen other cops, inside the electronics store
an hour later.  the tape is re-wound.
madison
(to parker)
whatever he was doing here was
only the start.
parker
start of what?
madison
i don't know, yet.  what we do
know is his performances are
increasing in scale, not
decreasing.
(a beat)
whatever it is, he isn't
finished...
she moves closer to the screen as the tape is played
back.  madison studies sid 6.7 intently.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
(recorded)
but rest assured...
(a beat)
a star is born.
madison
(to another cop)
you mind playing that part again?
her request is obliged.

madison
freeze it there --
she stares at sid 6.7, who is looking directly at her.
madison
(as if to sid 6.7)
you've discovered media, haven't
you?  you like the attention...
the power... you like being a star.
what are you going to do next,
star?  what are you going to...
her attention turns to the upper right corner of the
screen, where onlookers are visible watching sid 6.7.
their faces blurry.  but even out of focus, it isn't
hard to recognize lindenmeyer.
madison
(as if to lindenmeyer)
you do like to watch, don't you?
(to the surrounding
 cops)
if any of you are looking for
daryl lindenmeyer, that's him...
she points to lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to
parker, who's standing exactly where sid 6.7 was when
he killed the skinhead.  parker does not look at madison.
his eyes are fixed on the tv in front of him.
madison
it's not juse sid 6.7's performances
that are increasing.  stars need
bigger and bigger audiences.
(a beat)
whatever sid is going to do next,
it's going to involve media.
parker
you like baseball?

on tv

the baseball game continues.  players take the field at
the start of a new inning.  the outfielders can't help
but glance at the beautiful woman being shown in closeup
on the massive screen over left field.
announcer (v.o.)
i'll tell you, whoever's operating
the stadium's closed circuit
cameras must have fallen in love
because that beauty in j section
has been on the stadium's big
screen for over a minute now...
