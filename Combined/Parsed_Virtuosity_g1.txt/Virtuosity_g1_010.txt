he stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides,
as he is strip searched.  every portion of the body in
which someone could hide something is closely inspected.

procedure.  he opens his mouth as wide as possible.
pulls his earlobes forward to reveal behind them.  then

which is then returned to him.
