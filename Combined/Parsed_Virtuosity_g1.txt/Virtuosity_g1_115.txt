ext. top of garbage truck
108
parker lands on the back of the truck.  right next the
opening-and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive
trash compactor.  his gun tumbles from his hand, falling
to the street.
this sequence is identical to the one you previously wit-
nessed.  it is as if we've jumped back in time.
sid 6.7 dives on top of parker, putting him flat on his
stomach.  and his face against the steel teeth.  sid 6.7
chokes parker.  hard.
sid 6.7
i have to tell you, i do enjoy
you, parker.  i really don't want
to have to kill you...
the sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no
idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.
parker and sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal
jaws.  the machine makes an awful, grinding sound.  not
unlike the sounds parker and sid 6.7 are making.  the
fight is primal.  savage.  and moving at 30
miles-per-hour.

parker
what c-4... was cox talking about?
sid 6.7
let me put it to you this way...
whether i'm here... or whether i'm
not... i'm leaving an indelible
mark on the world tomorrow night.
parker
where did you plant the c-4?!
he should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
questions, because he's losing.  parker takes a wicked
shot to the face, and but then blocks the anticipated shot
to his groin.
sid 6.7 still manages to put parker'shead between the
compactor's jaws.  which are closing.
with every last ounce of effort he has, parker hurls his
legs up into sid 6.7.  which throws sid 6.7 into the
compactor.
sid 6.7 frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as
the steel jaws close in on him.  he gets his hands out.
then his head...
except parker now does something different.  just before
sid 6.7 is decapitated, parker jams a metal rod between
the compactor's steel teeth.  then grabs sid 6.7 by the
throat.
parker
(fiercely)
you can't die until you tell me
where the c-4 is.  where is it?!
sid 6.7
(choking)
my... secret.
he slams the back of his head into parker's nose.  break-
ing it.  parker reels back in pain.
sid 6.7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth.  the
jagged metal cutting into him, striping him with blood.
the blood then begins to retract.  sid 6.7's wounds, once
again, heal themselves.
sid 6.7
too bad you can't regenerate...
as the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the
street.  parker goes after him.  still in excrutiating
pain.  we pull back to reveal what you are seeing is...

the scene continues seamlessly.  as you may now be guess-
