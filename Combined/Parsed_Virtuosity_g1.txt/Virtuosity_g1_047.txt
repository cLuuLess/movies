dangling from the steering wheel.  parker has been free
the entire time.

as she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel,
parker wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face.
parker
sometimes, i like being part
machine.
annoyed, madison tosses him the car keys.  he starts the
engine and drives.
parker
why didn't you tell me you had a
daughter?
madison
i prefer keeping my professional
life separate from my personal
life.
parker
(a beat)
she's beautiful, you know?
madison
thank you.
(a beat)
her name is karin.
she turns on the police radio.
parker
want to tell me the real reason
we stopped at your house?
madison
i told you, it was on the way and
i wanted to change clothes.
parker
you should practice lying more
often.  you're awful at it.
(a beat)
where to?
madison

sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his
programming.
parker
what does that mean?

madison
now that he's in the real world,
there are no longer limitations on
his behavior like there were in
virtual reality.  sid is going to
evolve.
parker
sounds to me like a well-educated
way of saying you have no idea
what to do next.
madison
what i do know is that whatever
he's becoming, sid 6.7 is going
to be even worse than he was
before.
parker
then all we can do is stay mobile
and alert.  he's got to make a
move sometime, and we've got to be
ready when he does.
(a beat)
welcome to police work.  you
better like coffee.
he turns up the police radio.
