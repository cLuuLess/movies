int. cal tech computer lab - sid 6.7 cd-rom

being inserted into a disc drive inside the cal tech
computer lab.  very high-tech.  sitting at the computer
is alexiev borgen, 60s, the "grand old wizard" of the
facility.  parker and madison sit next to him.  around
them, young lindenmeyers are everywhere.
alexiev
(remembering fondly)
daryl lindenmeyer was only here
briefly, one semester at most.
but he was singularly the most
brilliant student i ever had in a
classroom.  he created programs
so beautiful, so lyrical, they
were almost like symphonies...
parker
can you tell us what's on the
disc?
alexiev
(working the

 computer)
there is... one program with
approximately 1.3 million lines of
programming.  it is thoroughly
secured, which is not surprising
considering lindenmeyer created
it.
madison
think you can get into the
program?
alexiev
(with appreciation)
hard to say -- lindenmeyer's
protection mechanisms were always
diabolically clever.
parker
you should see what he's been up
to recently.
