the room isn't clean.  the technology is outdated.  a
large, female nurse applies epoxy-like sealant to the
synthetic skin on parker's fingers.
nurse
i still don't know why they wasted
this fancy, new technology on you.
every time i fix you up, you only
go and mess it up again.
she sandpapers off the excess sealant.  then places his
elbow into an electronic sensitivity adjuster.
nurse
tell me how this feels...
she pricks parker's finger with a pin.

she does so, then pricks parker's finger again.  he
grimaces in pain.
nurse

parker

rather have no hands at all?
