cox and madison head back toward l.a.p.d. headquarters.
they are in mid-conversation:
madison
(with regret)
i should have told him.
cox
don't blame yourself.  in your
shoes, i don't think i would have
told parker, either.
(a beat)
so do you think grimes has
become the dominant personality?
madison
i'm not sure.  my guess is that's
what sid wants us to think.
cox
(a beat)
you think he's that smart?
madison
captain, i'm afraid of how smart
sid 6.7 is.
(a beat)
but i'm even more afraid of what
he's becoming.
