madison and lindenmeyer watch parker on screen.  madison
still has her gun trained on lindenmeyer, who notices a
warning light start to flash.  he turns to parker's
unconscious body lying on the bed.  lindenmeyer looks
concerned.
madison
what's wrong?
lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console.

lindenmeyer
he's developing a hemisphere
imbalance.
madison
talk so i can understand.
lindenmeyer
if i don't adjust the level of
neural information each side of
his brain is receiving, he won't
be able to walk when i take him
out of vr.
madison
then fix it.
as lindenmeyer moves to parker, madison stays right with
him.  her gun aimed at lindenmeyer's head.  lindenmeyer
carefully removes one of the neural connectors from
parker's skull cap.  before removing another, he looks
for a safe place to put the connector.
lindenmeyer
i need you to hold this.  it can't
get any dirt on it.
madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do.
lindenmeyer slowly give the neural connector to her free
hand.
lindenmeyer
all you have to do is hold the
needle at the base.  just make
sure not to jab yourself with the
point...
she clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her
gun with her right.  lindenmeyer removes a second neural
connector from parker's skull.
holding this second needle at the base, lindenmeyer makes
several adjustments on the neural management computer,
then moves slowly back to madison.
lindenmeyer
hand me the connector nice and...
he suddenly jabs his neural connector into madison's
right forearm.  madison has no time to react.  10,000
volts of electricity instantly courses through her body.
madison drops to the floor, unconscious.

the needle she had been holding falls from her grasp,
breaking the circuit.  she stops being electrocuted.
which saves her live.
lindenmeyer
(as sid 6.7 had
 said)
god, some people are stupid.
he sits back down at the simulator's main console, and
starts to type commands.  on the monitor, parker is vis-
ible exiting the shopping mall.
