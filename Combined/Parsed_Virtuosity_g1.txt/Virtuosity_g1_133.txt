int. letac - lindenmeyer's station - madison's pov
126
blurry.  of someone entering lindenmeyer's station in
letac.  you can't tell who it is, at first.  but you can
see the person is male.  and wearing lindenmeyer's pants.
you now see the person is sid 6.7.
madison forces herself into consciousness.  or as close to
it as she can get.  her expression is one of complete and
utter terror.
sid 6.7
dr. carter -- i've been hoping
we'd get a moment together...
mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind
several of the computers which make up the simulator.
sid 6.7 advances calmly toward her.
sid 6.7
you know so much about me, i was
hoping to learn a little bit about
you.  you see, i'm doing research,
too...
he looks behind the computers where you last saw madison.
she is no longer there.  sid 6.7 begins searching for her.
he passes a virtual reality monitor on which parker can
be seen clinging for life.
sid 6.7
(to the monitor)
hang in there, parker.

on the monitor, parker looks all around him, trying to
determine the voices origin.
madison crawls out of lindenmeyer's station.  sid 6.7
just catches sight of her, and goes after her.
