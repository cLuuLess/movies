int. parker's vehicle
49a
madison leans out the window, aiming her gun at sid 6.7,
as parker speeds toward the gridlock.
parker
nail the fucker.
madison's determination battles her inexperience.  sid 6.7
gets off the first shot.  crack!  that was the windshield
by parker's head.  he ducks down, driving blind.
parker
any time now...
madison fires.  nowhere close.  she adjusts her sights
and fires again.  the result is the same.

parker
what's the problem?
madison
i'm doing the best i can!
boom!  that was sid 6.7 shooting their front left tire.
parker loses control of the vehicle.
on street
parker's vehicle slams into a car stopped in front of
them.  air bags save parker and madison from injury, but
also prevent them from getting out of the car with any
speed.
by the time they do get out, sid 6.7 is long gone.
parker stares at madison with pure hatred.
