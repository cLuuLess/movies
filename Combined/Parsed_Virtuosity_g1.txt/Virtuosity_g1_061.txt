int. hollywood bowl - daryl lindenmeyer
54
watching the news on a pocket tv on a wooden bench that
morning.  both proud and horrified at the monster he has
unleashed upon the world.  you hear the classical music
in the b.g.
lindenmeyer begins to laugh.  uncontrollably.  the sounds
echoing.  as we pull back, you realize the bench is one
of many inside the hollywood bowl.
lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands.
he glances down at the members of the los angeles
philharmonic as they rehearse for an upcoming
performance.
whatever the event is, it's going to be big.  dozens of
technicians surround the stage, setting lights, cameras,
microphones, etc., for a live, pay-per-view broadcast.
