ext. top of garbage truck
104
parker lands on the back of the truck.  right next to the
opening-and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive
trash compactor.  his gun tumbles from his hand, falling
to the street.
sid 6.7 dives on top of parker, putting him flat on his
stomach.  and his face against the steel teeth.  sid 6.7
chokes parker.  hard.
sid 6.7
i have to tell you, i do enjoy
you, parker.  i really don't want
to have to kill you...
the sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no
idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck.
