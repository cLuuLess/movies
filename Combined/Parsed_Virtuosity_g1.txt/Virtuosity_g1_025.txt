parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room by a
guard, who then exits.  waiting for parker are chief of
police cox and elizabeth deane.
parker
(to cox)
you're wasting your time.  i'm not
going to play any more of your
goddam games.
cox
parker barnes, i'd like you to
meet crime czar elizabeth dane.
parker
(not shaking hands)
it's too early in the morning for
me to be cordial.  you got any
coffee?
deane
i watched your simulation, mr.
barnes.  very impressive.  you
know you're the only one to ever
go up against sid 6.7 who is
still alive.
parker
only because i got pulled out
early.
deane
nobody else ever got anywhere
near him.  nobody else...
understands him like you do.
parker, looking at her incredulously, moves his index
finger circularly, as in get on with it, already.  cox
opens a folder and shows parker several photographs of
reilly, or what was left of him.
cox
these were taken inside letac an
hour ago.  pretty pictures,
aren't they?
parker
i've seen worse.
cox
name was clyde reilly.  hardware
specialist.

cox (cont'd)
(a beat)
letac surveillance cameras got a
picture of the perp as he left
the building.
he hands a photograph of sid 6.7 exiting letac to parker.
cox
we don't know how, but sid 6.7
made himself into an android.
deane
(correcting him)
you mean a nano-tech synthetic
organism.
cox
whatever.
parker
(looking at the
 photo)
jesus christ.
(a beat)
can you kill it?
cox
if you can catch him.
parker
(a beat)
not from in here.
deane
(revealing a document)
this is a full pardon.  it
authorizes your immediate release.
she slides an unsigned pardon across the table to parker,
making sure to stay beyond his arm's reach.  cox reveals
a worn, l.a.p.d. badge.  it was parker's.
cox
recognize this?  how would you
like your old job back?
deane
(to parker)
catch him and your record's clean.
parker
what happens if i can't catch him?

deane
if sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we
throw you back in here and you
serve the rest of your sentence.
parker
how do you know i won't run?
deane holds up a small device called a locater implant.
it is the size of a dime.
deane
this is the newest technology
approved for general
implementation.  it's called a
locater implant.  every parolee
gets one.
(a beat)
we're going to know where you are
every second for the rest of your
life.
cox
(leaning to parker)
if you try to run, i'll hunt you
down and kill you myself.
deane
(a beat)
yes or no, mr. barnes?
