whose wrists and ankles are cuffed, being led into a
prison interrogation room.  dr. madison carter sits at a
table, a visitor's badge clipped to her suit.  a notepad
in front of her.
madison
(to guard)
the cuffs won't be necessary.
guard
no offense, ma'am, but i don't
think that's such a good idea.
madison
i would like the following three
things in this order:  your mouth
shut, cuffs off, and your ass
outside the door.  any questions?
the guard removes parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up
his post outside the door.  the skin around parker's
wrists is blue where the cuffs dug into his skin.
parker sits across from madison.  she places a micro-
recorder in the middle of the table and presses record.
parker
you actually listen to all those
tapes?

madison
(wryly)
no, i just like the effect a tape
recorder has on you.
(beat)
how you feeling today?
parker
a little less than yesterday.
madison
in other words, par for the
course.
(beat)
how do you feel about the
simulation you participated in
yesterday?
parker
john died.
madison
i know.  i was there.  i saw the
whole thing.
(beat)
if i was your therapist, i would
have advised you against putting
yourself back into that kind of
situation.
parker
you're not my therapist.  you're
here to study me.  face it -- i'm
nothing more than a lab rat to
you.
madison
that's not true, parker.
parker
if i had died yesterday, you'd
have already dissected my brain
and analyzed it to see if i carry
any genetic predisposition toward
violence.
madison
(beat)
what was going through your mind
when you killed the busboy?
parker
not much.  he was just a computer
program.  nothing more.

madison
you didn't see the expression you
had on your face when you pulled
the trigger.  but i did.
(beat)
you kind of liked it, didn't you?
that thrill of going over the
edge again.  of taking out an
innocent bystander or two, as
long as you got the target...
parker
go to hell.
madison
it was just like before, wasn't
it?  wasn't it?
(beat)
but you are making progress.
instead of killing seven people to
get the one you're after, this
time there was only one other
person involved.
parker
enough!
the guard pokes his head in with concern.
madison
get out!
the guard quickly shuts the door.  madison turns to
parker.
madison
i need to know what snapped in
you.  what made you capable of it.
you have to make me understand.
parker
i don't have to do anything except
survive.  and it's taking
everything i've got just to do
that.
