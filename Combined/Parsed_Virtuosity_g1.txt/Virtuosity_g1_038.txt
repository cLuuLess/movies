int. lindenmeyer's office
looking around the room, madison shakes her head.
madison
this lindenmeyer's a real piece
of work.
parker
(looking at a
 book shelf)
maybe after they catch him, you
should write a book about him...
he runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two
books in particular.  their titles are:  understanding
the criminal mind, and criminal pursuit -- a
psychological guide for law enforcement.  they were writ-
ten by dr. madison carter.
parker
i'm surprised you didn't write
one about me.
madison
i'm still working on it.
noticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre-
looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor.  you read its
name:  maestro.
madison
remember a few years ago when
music schools were using a
computerized teaching tool that
accidentally started frying kids'
brains?
parker
i've been in prison, remember?
madison
the government must have figured
there was no better person to
create a psycho than a psycho.
parker
just like they figured there was
no better person to catch one...

madison elects not to respond.  she sits down at the
computer, which rests between busts of beethoven and
mozart, and begins typing at the computer.  she works
with efficiency.  knowing exactly what she's doing.  she
is now in her element.
from a shelf, parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice
inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup.  then flips
through one of the books written by madison.  only half-
interested.
madison
(keeping her eyes
 on screen)
i am the demon from the
bottomless pit...
parker
(remembering,
 not reading)
... here on earth to create havoc
and terror.  i am war, i am death.
i am destruction.  david berkowitz,
1977.
madison
i am impressed.
parker
(quoting)
for murder, though it have no
tongue, will speak with most
miraculous organ.
madison
who said that?
parker
hamlet.
(a beat)
what's david berkowitz got to do
with sid 6.7?
madison
(pointing to the
 screen)
he's part of the mix.  sid 6.7 is
a composite.
on computer screen
the graphics show you that sid 1.2 was a combination of
charles manson and billy the kid.

you see what look like two viruses, which represent each
criminal's psychological profile, attacking each other.
the result is a molten blob.
berkowitz was added to create sid 1.3.  a three-way
pyschological battle, more hostile than the first,
occurs.  sid 1.4, adding the terrorist, abu nidal, makes
the conflict even more violent.  and so on.
madison stares at the computer screen in awe.  parker
flips through cd-rom hard copies of the different
versions of sid.
madison
lindenmeyer put increasingly
complex combinations of criminal
psychological profiles together to
develop the ultimate villain.
parker
(understand)
creating a whole far more
dangerous than the sum of its
parts.
madison
but rather than selecting pieces
from each individual, he simply
let the stronger traits of each
individual cannibalize the weaker
ones.
she continues opening the files of the higher versions of
sid.  version 5.9 consists of 67 different profiles.
the visualized psychological battle is intense.  and
extremely violent.  the 6.7 version, with 183 profiles,
is even worse.
madison
it's a good bet a couple of the
dominant personalities teamed up
to overpower the others.
(beat)
the question is, which one of the
dominants then finally managed to
take control?
attempting to open the files of the composite profiles,
madison discovers they are protected by encryption.

madison
(re:  lindenmeyer)
he'll let us see the ingredients
that went in, but not how the soup
turned out after stirring.
madison scrolls through the list of 183 names,
stopping at the name mathew grimes.  alarm registers
on her face.  as parker comes over to look over her
shoulder, she quickly scrolls through the list to get
the name off the screen.  he holds the sid 6.7 cd-rom
in hand.
parker
this is getting you pumped up,
isn't it?  this is like the world
series to you.
madison
as a matter of fact, it is.
parker points to a name on the screen:  jeffery dahmer.
parker
remember the bowling ball bag sid
carried with him in virtual
reality?
madison
dahmer carried the head of one of
his victims in a bowling bag for
over a week.  kept it in his
locker while he was at work in a
candy factory.
(re:  sid 6.7 cd-rom)
we need to get a look at sid 6.7's
final profile.
parker
what we need to do is stop playing
with computers and go catch the
son-of-a-bitch before he kills
anybody else.
madison
in order to find him, we have
to understand what makes him
tick...
