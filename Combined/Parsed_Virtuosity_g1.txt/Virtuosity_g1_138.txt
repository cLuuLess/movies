deane
what did you find out?
parker
call off the manhunt looking for
me.  i didn't kill the transport
guards.
deane
it's already been called off.
witnesses confirmed you weren't
the shooter.
(a beat)
did you find out where the bomb
is?
parker
no, but i've confirmed the re-
election rally is the target.

how much c-4 is missing?
deane
enough to level an entire city
block.
parker
if i were you, i'd get every
demolition team in the city
searching in and around the
biltmore hotel.
deane
(with frustration)
demolition teams have searched
everywhere in and around the
hotel.  i don't know where...
parker
(interrupting);
sid is smart enough to know you'd
check everywhere in the immediate
area.  whatever the device is,
he's probably got it timed to move
into position just before it
detonates.
(a beat)
have the demo teams check every
subway tunnel, water pipe, gas
pipe, and sewer that goes under,
over, or into the arena.
