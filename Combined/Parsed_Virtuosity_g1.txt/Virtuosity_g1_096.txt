which reads:  linda davis barnes (1961-1992) and
christine mary barnes (1987-1992).  parker kneels in
front of it.  magic hour.
madison and cox wind their way to him through obstacle
course of tombstones.  parker stands as they arrive.  he
is wiped out.  there is no emotion left in him.
madison
we know you didn't kill those
guards.
parker
they're going to fry me for it,
anyway.
cox
nobody's going to fry anybody...
he approaches, holding the circuits he ripped out of the
locater transmission room.
cox
(re: circuits)
don't worry, they have no idea
where you are.
parker
you son of a bitch.  how could
you let them put the implant in
my head?  how?
madison
he didn't know about the neural
toxin.
(a beat)
i did.
parker
(matter-of-factly)
you knew the entire time?  can
you give me one good reason why i
shouldn't kill you right now?
cox
she saved your life, parker.  she
didn't have to, but she did.
parker
(turning to
 madison)
then i guess we're even.

madison
(a beat)
how did you find out about the
toxin?
parker
sid 6.7 told me after he killed
the two guards.  he suggested i
kill you rather than him.
madison
you're not capable of it.
parker
i pose an unacceptable danger to
the public, remember?
madison
i was wrong.
(a beat)
and i was wrong not to tell you
grimes was part of sid.  i
should have told you.  i won't
make the same mistake again.
she means it.  parker turns away, looking at his wife's
headstone.
cox
the son of a bitch is still out
there, parker.
parker turns toward him slowly.  emotion beginning to
return to his face.
parker
(a beat)
when this is over, will you get
this goddamn thing out of my
head?
cox
on my life, i promise you i will.
parker
if you're lying, i'll hunt you
down and kill you myself.
