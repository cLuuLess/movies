parker and madison race past the cars waiting to merge
into what is effectively a parking lot.  as is normal
for this thoroughfare, traffic is at a standstill.
sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen.  parker and madison
split-up, wading through different lanes of traffic.
startling the already frustrated motorists.  who roll up
their windows.  lock their doors.  and some of whom
reveal weapons of their own.
madison pauses, listening.  she has no idea that sid 6.7
steps behind her.  wham!  he cold cocks her with the butt
of his gun.  madison crumples to the street.
which now leaves parker a clean shot at sid 6.7's head.
boom!  boom!  two hits.  two head wounds.  sid 6.7 falls
behind a truck, losing his weapon.
before sid 6.7's wounds have finished regenerating,
parker is already on top of him.
parker
(neighborly)
hey, old buddy, old pal, good to
see you again.
he empties his clip into sid 6.7, then discards the gun.
as sid 6.7's wounds heal themselves, parker pounds him
mercilessly.
sid 6.7
(losing it)
you... ruined... everything!  i'm
going to kill you!!!
trading blows, he manages to get to his feet.

parker
now, is that any way to talk to an
old friend?
sid 6.7
(exploding)
barnes, you're dead!
he knocks parker back with a good shot to the face, then
disappears around a van.
parker continues the hunt.  quietly.  carefully.  tension
grows in the silence that follows.
he carefully makes his way around a truck.  only to see
sid 6.7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head.
wham!!!
parker is knocked on his ass.  dazed.  blood streams down
his cheek.  he staggers to his feet, blocking another
blow with his arm.  which snaps the wood in two.
parker grabs one of the boards.  he battles with sid 6.7.
the fight between parker and sid 6.7 is intense.
exhausting.  parker gives it everything he has.
madison appears behind parker, holding his gun.  she
wavers, having trouble keeping her balance.  she has even
more trouble aiming her weapon.
madison
hey, parker...
she moves around, trying to get a clean shot at sid 6.7.
which she does not have.
parker
how's your pulse?
madison
(totally focused)
i couldn't tell you.
parker
then shoot him already.
madison
duck!
without hesitation, parker hits the deck.  leaving
sid 6.7 completely exposed.  madison steadies her sight.

sid 6.7
(to madison)
you couldn't hit the side of a...
as he raises his two-by-four high over parker's head,
madison pulls the trigger smoothly.
in slow motion, you follow the bullet as it exits the
barrel of her gun.  and penetrates sid 6.7's skull
between the eyes and exits out the back of his head.
sid 6.7 collapses on the ground next to parker.
madison
what do we do now?
parker
you won't want to watch.  turn
around.
she does so.  parker reaches out of frame to remove the
sid 6.7 character module from within his skull.  then
reveals the character module in hand.
madison
what should we do with it?
glancing in the flatbed of a truck, parker gets an idea,
and knocks on the driver's window.  as the driver rolls
down his window, classic rock & roll music can be heard
from inside.
parker
mind if i borrow a couple of your
tools for a second?
driver
be my guest.
parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the
truck.  he offers one to madison.
parker
care to join me?
madison gladly accepts, takes the sledgehammer.  parker
drops the sid 6.7 character module onto the pavement.
and together, they start pounding the shit out of it.
wham!  wham!  in perfect time with the music.  which the
driver cranks even louder.  as we roll credits.
