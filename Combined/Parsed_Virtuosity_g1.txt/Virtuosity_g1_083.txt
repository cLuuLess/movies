30 minutes later.  the chaos outside dodger stadium has
subsided.  madison and two paramedics lead the bandaged
college student to an ambulance.
madison goes to parker, who sits quietly by himself.
elbows on his knees.  head between his hands.  staring
at the cement between his feet.
madison
(angrily)
do you have any idea the trauma
you put that kid through?!
parker doesn't respond.  all around them, a cacophony of
news broadcasts is heard.  from passing cars.  from boom
boxes.  from portable tvs.  over and over, you hear what
sid 6.7 had said while killing the woman in dodger
stadium:
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
(recorded)
hey, parker, this one's for you...
hey, parker, this one's for you...
as parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are
looking at the face of a wild animal.  eyes rabid.  jaw
clenched.  pure anger.  violence about to erupt.  without
fear.  without guilt.  the beast within has been unleashed.

parker
(in a whisper)
that's grimes...
madison backs away in fear.  parker rises gradually.
parker
(voice slowly rising)
the man who killed my wife... who
killed my daughter... who ruined
my life used to taunt me with that
line...
parker advances toward madison, who continues backing
away.
parker
(exploding)
grimes is back!  he's back!  he's
come back!!!
madison
(standing her ground)
no!  grimes isn't back.  he's
only one part of sid.  sid 6.7
is a hell of a lot worse than
grimes ever was.
(a beat)
get a hold of yourself!
she tries to grab him by the shoulders.  parker blocks
her arms away.
parker
(going nose-to-nose)
but he's in there.  and you knew
it, didn't you?  didn't you?!
she tries to back away, but backs herself against a
light pole.  madison has nowhere to go.  parker grabs
her by the collar, and shoves her against the pole.
hard.
parker
(hysterical)
god, you fucking know-it-all!
you've known all along and didn't
tell me!  why?!  were you afraid
i'd lose it?!  go over the edge?!
huh?!  is that what you were
afraid of?!  why didn't you tell
me???!!!

a prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to
them fast.  two of the prison guards met earlier jump out
of the transport, advancing on parker.  their weapons
aimed at his head.
guard
hands up!  now!
parker slowly raises his hands in the air.  a guard re-
lieves him of his weapon.
madison
(recovering)
what's going on?
guard
he's going back where he belongs.
deane and cox step out of the police vehicle.
deane
(to madison)
you were right, dr. carter.
letting a lunatic like barnes
loose in the real world did pose
an unacceptably dangerous risk to
the public.
(glancing at cox)
i should have never tried to
solve one problem by allowing the
creation of another.
(to madison)
chief cox will give you a ride
back to the station.  you will
provide him with any and all
information you have developed
thus far.
(to parker)
enjoy the rest of your sentence,
mr. barnes.
she exits.  cox and parker stand facing each other.  cox
wishes there was something he could do.  parker looks
completely out of it.  cox extends his hand.  after a
moment, parker takes it.  but his mind is way off
elsewhere.
guard
(forcefully to
 parker)
let's go.
madison looks on as parker is herded roughly into the
back of the prison transport.

parker...
parker shuts her up with a look.  there is nothing that
can be said.  the prison transport doors are slammed
shut.  the vehicle takes off.
