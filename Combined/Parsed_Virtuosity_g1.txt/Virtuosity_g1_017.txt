the stunningly-beautiful sheila 3.2. appears.  in very
revealing lingerie.  performing an outrageous strip-
tease.

sheila 3.2. (v.o.)
(seductively)
i hope watching me is as big a
turn on for you as dancing is for
me...
reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if
he could touch the contours of sheila 3.2's body.
reilly
oh, believe me, it is.  it is...
he is so aroused, he's shaking.  lindenmeyer, on the
other hand, appears almost uninterested.  he's used to
the routine.
on the monitor, sheila 3.2 continues her strip-tease.
slowly.  sensually.  licking her lips.  grinding her
hips.  putting on quite a show.
she removes her top, revealing ideal breasts.  she
fondles her nipples.  as well as the rest of herself.
lindenmeyer and reilly continue watching.  reilly can
barely control himself.
sheila is very, very good at what she does.  a virtuoso
stripper.  reilly is transfixed.  until lindenmeyer
pushes a button, blacking out the virtual reality screens.
reilly
hey!!!
lindenmeyer
show's over unless i get to see
what you've been working on after
hours.
reilly
(paranoid)
i haven't been working on anything.
lindenmeyer
(threateningly)
do i get to see it or not?
reilly
(a beat)
bastard...
(to a monitor)
sheila, don't go anywhere.  i'll
be right back.

he rushes out.  sid 6.7 appears on the various monitors
next to sheila 3.2.  he kisses her cheek.  caresses her
body.  sheila 3.2 enjoys the attraction.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
she's some of your finest work,
daryl.
lindenmeyer
all my work is my finest.
sid 6.7 continues appreciating sheila 3.2  as reilly
races back in, the monitors then all go black.
reilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by its
head.  he dangles the snake right in front of
lindenmeyer's face.  terrifying him.
lindenmeyer
(backing away fast)
get that fucking thing away from
me!
reilly
(laughing)
you're... such a wimp.
he grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through
the snake.  the half of the snake which drops to the
floor stops moving.
but the half still in reilly's hand begins regenerating a
new tail.  literally growing a new one.  lindenmeyer
can't believe his eyes.  he studies the snake closely.
reilly
watching your v.r. people auto
reset gave me the idea.
lindenmeyer
(in awe)
it's nano-technology, isn't it?
machines the size of molecules...
reilly
(proudly)
coordinated by polymer neural net.
lindenmeyer
(touching the snake)
it feels so... real.

reilly
it's better than real.  it's
synthetic flesh.  synthetic blood.
synthetic organs...
(a beat)
it's a physiological machine.
lindenmeyer
(awed)
this is supposed to be years away.
reilly
as far as the public is concerned,
it is.  the reason you got fired,
and i got my second demo into
production, is i'm a lot smarter
than you.  i never give my best
stuff away.
lindenmeyer
(restraining himself)
how do you kill it?
reilly
separate the character module from
the neutral net...
using lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's
head and removes a small character module connected to
to the base of the neutral net.  the snake stops moving.
it "dies."
reilly
... and you get nano-death.
(discarding the
 snake)
don't worry, i've got a bunch of
other ones.
lindenmeyer
amazing.  i hate to say it, but it
is.
reilly
i know.
(a beat)
i'm ready to incubate something a
little more advanced than a cold-
blooded reptile.  if you want to
experience the future, meet me in
my office in 15 minutes.  and
bring the sheila 3.2 character
module with you...

he exits.  as lindenmeyer reaches for the sheila 3.2
character module, sid 6.7 appears on the screen in front
of him and winks.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
you catching my drift?
lindenmeyer
i think i understand what you have
in mind...
peeling the label off the sid 6.7 character module,
lindenmeyer removes the module from its slots.  sid 6.7
disappears from the screen.
