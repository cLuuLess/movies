parker gets out of the car.  madison follows suit.
madison
what are you doing?!
he walks around the car, brushing past her.  then drops
to his knees at the side of the road.  he puts his hands
in the dirt, feeling the earth between his fingers.
parker
(meaningfully)
every day for the last five years,
i told myself someday i would be
out here again.  no more bars.  no
more guards.  no more fights just
to stay alive.
(a beat)
every day for the last five years,
i told myself that lie.
madison
it wasn't a lie.
parker
every time i said it, it was.  i
never really thought i was going
to make it.
taking a deep breath, he wipes the dirt off his hands.
then stands.
madison
you all right?
parker
(completely at ease)
fine.  never felt better in my
life.
(a beat)
see, i'm a good liar.
he gets back in the vehicle.  off madison's reaction,
we --
cut to:
40.

several tv reporters

talking live to their cameras on the street in front of a
beautiful, suburban home in toluca lake, which is now a
crime scene.  six pm.
reporter #1
(to her camera)
as l.a.p.d. officers continue
gathering evidence at this grisly
crime scene, you can only ask
yourselves -- what kind of
lunatic would commit such
unthinkable crimes?
parker and madison make their way through the curious
trying to see what's going on.  several reporters double-
take parker, then quickly instruct their photographers to
take shots of him.
parker and madison present their identification to the
cops keeping the curious at bay.
cop #1
(recognizing parker)
son... of... a... bitch.
parker and madison continue toward the house.  getting an
increasing amount of attention, particularly from the
other cops.  some look on with awe.  some with disdain.
but nobody is in between.
madison
(quietly to parker)
you ready for this?
parker
don't worry.  if i can't handle
it, i'll just kill everybody.
he gives her a brief smile.  which madison does not
return.  one of the other policemen tentatively
approaches parker.
cop #2
i've always wanted to tell you
that if the same thing happened to
me, i would do the exact same
thing as you -- if i had the
balls.
he extends his hand to parker, who shakes it.
(continued)
41.

continued:

cop #3
(to cop #2)
then you'd be a disgrace to the
badge, too.
he turns to parker, who is looking right at him.  not
with anger.  not with any emotion, really.  but it's
enough to scare the shit out of cop #3, who walks away.
