madison
were you able to get into the
program?
alexiev
yes.  but then i tripped over an
erasure mine.
parker
in english, please.
alexiev
i accidently triggered a
protection mechanism which erased
the entire program.
parker and madison turn to each other -- shit.
alexiev
it was very well hidden.  there
was no way to see it until it was
too late.
parker
(a beat)
it's not your fault.  we
appreciate you trying.
alexiev
look, i feel bad about this, so
i'm going to try to look into the
programming of his maestro
teaching tool for you.
(holding up keyboard)
i've had one sitting around for
years.  maybe i can learn
something that you'll find useful.
madison
let us know.
