int. shopping mall - first floor

sid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly
at you.  a 200 pound rock.  wham!!!  he lands face down
in the marble floor.  the impact is bone-crushing.  sid
6.7 does not move.
until he begins to regenerate.  his fluids begin return-
ing to his body.  his bones regaining proper form.  within
seconds, his body appears as good as new.
(note:  technically, because this is vr, the proper term
would be auto. reset.  but since sid 6.7 thinks he's in
the real world, regenerating is what he thinks he's
doing.)
sid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off.
sid 6.7
man, what a rush.
(yelling up to parker)
adios, amigo!
grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.
