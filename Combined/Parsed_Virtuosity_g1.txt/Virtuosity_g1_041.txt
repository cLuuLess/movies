the bartender is a low-tech robo-tender.  patrons sit
quietly, drinking themselves into oblivion.  sid 6.7
takes a seat next to a businessman slumped at the bar.
sid 6.7
(thoughtfully)
ever had one of those days where
you decide something important
about yourself?  you know, where
you say, 'i'm not just what i've
been programmed to be.  i can do
what i want, when i want, how i
want, because i'm my own peson'?

(slurring)
you one of them new age assholes?
sid 6.7
just a soul on a personal journey.
what i've realized is that i'm
capable of anything.  i have to
start expanding my horizons...
the robo-tender rolls over to sid 6.7.
robo-tender
(digital, scratchy)
want... a... drink?
sid 6.7
to think you constitute one of my
ancestors --
he shoots the robo-tender between his mechanical eyes.
the businessman smiles, like he's thought about doing
exactly the same thing.
businessman
listen, buddy... thinking big is
fine... but you shouldn't forget
where you come from, either.
sid 6.7 thinks about it.  long and hard.
sid 6.7
you know, you're absolutely right.
(pointing)
would you mind sitting over there?
he points to a table with several other businessmen.
businessman
what for?
sid 6.7
every orchestra is divided into
sections.  like instruments sit
with like instruments.  now be
a good instrument and sit with
your own kind...
he lifts the businessman off his bar stool and carries
him to the table.
