parker's pov - across tracks
passengers rush in every direction.  some are screaming.
some are crying.  nobody knows who fired the shot.  or
where to go.  but everyone is going somewhere.
including sid 6.7, who makes his way through the flurry
of movement toward the up escalator.  it is difficult
to keep sight of him.
parker
moves toward the edge of the platform, aiming his gun
across the tracks.  those around him quickly back away.
parker
(yelling)
everybody get down!
only about half the passengers on the north-bound side
can hear him above the screaming already going on.
sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen.
parker
(screaming)
get down!!!
the rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a
college student listening to music on headphones.  he
is riding the escalator up.  sid 6.7 stands behind him,
using the student as a shield.
parker's pov
as sid 6.7 ascends, slight portions of his body are
momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways
with the music coming from his headphones.  parker
does not have a clean shot.
in ten seconds, sid 6.7 will disappear from view com-
pletely and parker will have no shot at all.  a momentary
sliver of sid 6.7 becomes visible.  an inch-and-a-half at
most.
parker
doesn't hesitate.  he lines up his shot and pulls the
trigger.
