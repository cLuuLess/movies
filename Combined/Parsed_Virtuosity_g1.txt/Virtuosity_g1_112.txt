parker and sid 6.7 continue battling next to the compac-
tor's lethal jaws.  the machine makes an awful, grinding
sound.  not unlike the sounds parker and sid 6.7 are
making.  the fight is primal.  savage.  and moving at 30
miles-per-hour.
parker
what c-4... was cox talking about?
sid 6.7
let me put it to you this way...
whether i'm here... or whether i'm
not... i'm leaving an indelible
mark on the world tomorrow night.
parker
where did you plant the c-4?!
he should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking
questions, because he's losing.  parker takes a wicked
shot to the face, and then the groin.  sid 6.7 holds
parker's head between the compactor's jaws.  which are
closing.
with every last ounce of effort he has, parker hurls
his legs into sid 6.7.  which throws sid 6.7 into the
compactor.
the steel jaws immediately close in on sid 6.7, who
frantically tries to climb out.  he gets his hands out.
then his head.  but that's about it.
without emphasizing graphic detail, sid 6.7 is decapitat-
ed.  his lifeless body drops back into the compactor.
his head tumbles to the street.  the force of the impact
causes the sid 6.7 character module to separate from
the neural net.
the character module scatters into the street.  parker
immediately jumps off the truck after it.
