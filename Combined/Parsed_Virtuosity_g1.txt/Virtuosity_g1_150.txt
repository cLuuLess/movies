int. hollywood bowl - guest conductor
144
whose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in
a truly magnificent performance of tchaikovsky's fifth
symphony inside the hollywood bowl.
the guest conductor waves his baton wildly.  passion-
ately.  brilliantly.  getting the absolute best from the
members of the orchestra.
the musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed
to the musical limit.
as the guest conductor turns to the next page of his
sheet music on the podium, you notice seven small, high-
frequency sensors above an upcoming musical measure.
the sensors are wired together.  when the seven notes
are played in sequence, an electrical pulse will be trig-
gered down the wires which run down the side of the
podium, beneath the stage.
