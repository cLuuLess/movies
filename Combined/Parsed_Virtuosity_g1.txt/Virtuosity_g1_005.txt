the building is heavily-guarded.  razor wire, land mines,
armed sentries.  nobody who shouldn't be here gets any-
where near here.
cox leads parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport.
the two guards walk behind at a distance.  two more by
the transport.  the chain between parker's legs keeps his
steps short.
cox
what the hell did you have to shoot
the busboy for?
parker
he was a computer program for
crissake.
cox
you were supposed to act as if
everything was real.
parker
real, my ass.  it's an overblown
game.
(a beat)
anybody ever catch that fucking
psycho?
cox
before you, nobody else had gotten
close enough to sid 6.7 to take a
shot at him.  hell, nobody else
had even been able to start
tracking him before he got to
them.
(eyeing parker's
 scar)
new scar -- you making it okay in
there?

parker
(head down)
i'm getting by.
he starts walking ahead of cox.  distancing himself.
cox
(pausing for
 emphasis)
you've got to know i tried keeping
you out of general population.
goddam politicians...
his voice trails off as parker turns around, and heads
directly toward him.
parker
(locking eyes)
you want to know how i'm doing?
every day, i lose a little bit
more of myself.
(beat)
i'm becoming something else, and
it scares the hell out of me.
he turns back toward the transport.  cox follows.  two
armed guards open the back doors for parker, then stand
poised with weapons out and ready.
