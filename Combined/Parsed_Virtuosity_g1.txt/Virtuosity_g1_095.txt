the room is still under construction.  wallace stands be-
hind a technician sitting at a console in front of a
massive electronic map tracking several convicts, includ-
ing parker.  the technician is typing in an elaborate
termination code.
technician
who are we going to fry?
wallace
just an unrepentant criminal who
is apparently going to die from a
previously undiagnosed brain
tumor.
cox enters, concerning wallace.
wallace
what are you doing here, sir?
cox
just paying my last respects.
he surveys the electronic map, locating parker.  just as
the lights go black.  wallace and the technician
immediately panic.
wallace
what happened?!
technician
i don't know.  we've lost all
power!
cox
the heat's been causing brown-
outs all over the city.  get
above ground until it's
restored.
wallace and the technician rush out of the room, up the
emergency stairs.  cox sets to work ripping out the con-
sole's circuitry.  by the time he's finished, the equip-
ment in here won't be able to toast a piece of bread.
