int. lindenmeyer's station in letac
109
parker lies unconscious on a bed.  he is connected to the
simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane
skull cap, just like he was before.
the sid 6.7 character module is plugged into the system's
main console.  lindenmeyer sits at the controls.  madison
next to him, her gun aimed at lindenmeyer's head.
they are both watching parker chase sid 6.7 on the monitor
in front of them.  parker continues experiencing intoler-
able pain.  a clock reads 4:00 am.  they are the only
ones inside the entire facility.
lindenmeyer
i told you this would work.  by
setting back the clocks, he has
absolutely no idea he's in virtual
reality.  he still thinks he's in
the real world.
madison
(a beat)
what's wrong with parker?
lindenmeyer
(innocently)
how should i know?
madison
(getting an idea)
show me his physical sensory level.
she clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the
barrel against lindenmeyer's ear.  he does as told.  on a
panel by the console, you read:  participant physical
sensory level:  670%.
lindenmeyer
i wonder how that...
madison
turn it down!
lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%.
