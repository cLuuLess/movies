graffiti covers the walls.  red uses a stained urinal,
then turns to the stalls.  a pair of prison-issue shoes
and socks are visible beneath one of them.

time to hurt...
red kicks in the door to the stall.  revealing a pair of
shoes and socks stuffed with a prison shirt.  red hears
something behind him.  and turns around slowly.
parker stands barefooted and shirtless.  scars are
visible around each arm just below the elbow.  you will
learn what these represent momentarily.
parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than
red.  but the punch parker delivers to red's face makes
you think it's the other way around.

you hear the sound of metal crushing bone.  red is thrown
backwards into the stall.  blood splatters from his
mouth, adding another shade of redness to his face.
another angle
red's teeth stick out of parker's fist.  parker pulls out
the teeth.  he does not bleed.  nor seem in pain.  metal
is visible beneath the surface of his skin.
for the first time, you notice small tattoos on the out-
sides of his palms.  they read:  "wentlow model 17-l,"
and "17-r," followed by serial numbers.
red charges parker wildly.  parker dodges him like a
matador does a bull.  then brings his fists down savagely
on the back of red's head.  his skull cracks.  red drops
to the floor.
parker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck.
choking him.  red staggers to his feet.  his eyes wide.
his face now even redder.
parker maintains his mechanical grip.  red finally
succumbs to the lack of oxygen.  he drops to his knees.
parker does not relent until he feels the barrel of a
gun at the back of his head.

fun's over.
parker lets go, dropping red to the wet, filthy floor.
