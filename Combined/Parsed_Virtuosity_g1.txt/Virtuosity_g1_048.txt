int. upscale nightclub

sid 6.7 has separated the patrons into four separate
groups:  older men and women, and younger men and women.
all are frozen in their seats with fear.
sid 6.7 points the gun at one group, then another, waving
his arm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were
a baton.  sid 6.7 clearly enjoys this game of terror.
he delights in the patrons' fear, and revels in his power
over them.
sid 6.7
good... very good... nice...
(pointing at a woman)
you -- in the middle -- don't
hold back.  give it to me!
he fires his gun just above her head.  she screams in
terror.

sid 6.7
that's better...
he continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking
ever increasing emotional responses from his
"instruments."  a guy entering the bar does a quick about
face.  gone by the time sid 6.7 glances at the door.
sid 6.7
god, i hate interruptions.
(to the patrons)
once again, from the top --
boom!  he shoots again, just missing a man's foot.
