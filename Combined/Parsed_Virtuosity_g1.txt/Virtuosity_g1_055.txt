int. parker's vehicle
47b
parker's eyes are locked on the road with fierce deter-
mination.  madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and
excitement.  she holds onto the door handle for dear
life.
parker
being on the street's a little
different than sitting in an
office all day, isn't it?
madison
(gritting her teeth)
enjoying yourself?
parker
you know i am.
madison
this isn't a game, parker!
parker
(re:  sid 6.7)
tell him.
sid 6.7 (v.o.)
(over police radio)
glad to see you're on the case,
officer barnes.  or should i say,
inmate 673429...
madison
(in disbelief)
that who i think it is?
parker turns to her, then picks up the radio.
parker
(into radio)
call me whatever you want,
asshole.
parker accelerates even faster.  closing the gap between
them and sid 6.7.
intercut with:
48
