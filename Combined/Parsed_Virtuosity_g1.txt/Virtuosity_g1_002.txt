int. expensive french restaurant
2
well-dressed patrons.  lavish food.  classical music.
one man sits alone.  enjoying sumptuous escargot.  his
name is
sid 6.7
sadistic.  intelligent.  dangerous.  30s.  incredibly
handsome.  almost perfect.  frightening.  the kind of
eyes that draw you in, then make you want to run like
hell.
sid 6.7 finishes the last of his snails and washes it
down with fine chardonnay.  he savors the tastes.  then
delicately wipes the corners of his mouth.
parker and john
enter through the front doors.  catching their breath,
they unholster sidearms.  the maitre d' approaches.
oblivious or uncaring about their weapons.
maitre d'
(accented)
good afternoon.  may i help you?
parker and john completely ignore him.  john follows
parker as he moves through the restaurant, scanning each
patron intently.  the diners glance at the officers' guns
with mild curiosity, but not alarm.
john
what are we looking for?

parker
it's in the eyes...
john
what'll they look like?
parker
(a beat, staring)
like mine.
they split-up.  the maitre d', still facing the front
doors, repeats his greeting to no one in particular.
maitre d'
good afternoon,  may i help you?
parker spots sid 6.7 across the room.  without hesitation,
the hunter charges his prey.  gun out and firing.  not
what you would call standard police procedure.
bullets riddle sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair.
he lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath
his table.
john charges from the other direction until a woman gets
up from her chair, standing directly in john's line of
fire.
john
(to the woman)
lady, move!
before she can do so, sid 6.7 stands behind the woman,
grabbing her and throwing her across the table into
parker.  crash!  they tumble to the floor.
in the same movement, sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside
his jacket and shoots john in the shoulder before he can
fire.  john's gun flies from his hand.  sid 6.7 advances
toward him.
parker struggles to his feet.  aims his weapon.  sid 6.7
does the same, but without looking.  boom!  parker gets
a bullet through his shooting arm.  his wound identical
to john's.  parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his
arm goes limp.
parker charges him wildly, but sid 6.7 brutally kicks him
in the stomach.  in perfect rhythm with the symphony play-
ing in the b.g.  parker doubles over, gasping for breath.
another kick drops parker to his knees.

sid 6.7
(to parker)
i'm going to rehearse with your
friend a while, then i'll be back
to perform a new piece with you.
he grabs his bowling bag and slams it into john's head,
knocking him out.  sid 6.7 puts john's unconscous body
over his shoulder.
sid 6.7
if you get hungry, i'd recommend
the escargot.  they're delicious.
he carries john and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen.
parker scrambles to his gun, and reaches after sid 6.7.
