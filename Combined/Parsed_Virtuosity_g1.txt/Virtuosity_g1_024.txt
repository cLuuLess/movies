int. reilly's office
the human form inside incubator opens the hatch.  steam
pours out from within its confines as it climbs out
slowly.
the figure stands within the mist, admiring itself.  then
its surroundings.
reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a
father about to see his newborn child for the first time.
lindenmeyer hangs back.
reilly
(expecting sheila
 3.2)
baby, what i'm gonna do to you...
his face drops when sid 6.7 steps out of the mist.
completely naked.  lindenmeyer smiles proudly.  fear-
fully.  wickedly.
reilly
(to lindenmeyer)
who the hell is this?!
sid 6.7
my name is sid.  sid 6.7.
he extends his hand as if to shake.  then grabs reilly by
the throat and chokes him.  hard.
lindenmeyer
sid -- no!!!
sid 6.7
what do you expect me to do, thank
him?
reilly
(gasping for air)
this... isn't... possible!

sid 6.7
sure it is -- and it's all thanks
to the many long hours put in by
you and daryl.
he watches reilly's face with curiosity as the life drains
from it.  a puddle forms beneath him.  he drops reilly's
body to the floor.
sid 6.7
(to lindenmeyer)
real instruments are so much more
responsive than virtual ones,
don't you think?
lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen.  the office door is
unlocked, and open.  watching sid 6.7's expression, you
realize something isn't quite right.
his expression is exaggerated.  artificial.  only for a
moment, but it's enough to remind you sid 6.7 is not
human.
the billions of nano-mechanisms which make up his anatomy
are still learning to function in a fully-coordinated
fashion.  sid 6.7 is, literally, getting used to his new
skin.
in various ways throughout his "life" -- be it a wandering
eye, or a momentary limp -- you will be reminded that sid
6.7 is a synthetic nano-organisem unlike anyone has ever
seen.
a surgical knife by the aquarium catches sid 6.7's atten-
tion.  picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the
razor-sharp knife blade.  cutting himself slightly.  a
drop of blood appears.  sid 6.7 tastes his (synthetic)
blood.
sid 6.7
tastes different, somehow.
he then watches with interest as his wound regenerates,
healing itself.  the scar tissue is slightly off color.
sid 6.7
i think i'm going to like it here.
glancing at reilly's prone body, he then slams the office
door in our face.
