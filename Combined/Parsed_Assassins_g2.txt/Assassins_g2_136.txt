     electra watches as bain moves along the plywood wall,
     covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out
     of the burned hotel.  he is carrying a long nylon duffel
     bag.

     at the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled
     loose and bain squeezes through, into the hotel.

                             electra
               he's inside.
