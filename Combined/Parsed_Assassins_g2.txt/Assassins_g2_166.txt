     int. burned hotel

     electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black
     plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  it hangs in the space
     between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor.

                             rath (v.o.)
               he's coming, electra!  get out now!

                             electra
               oh, god.  i see it!

     she reaches for it, but it's too high.

                             rath (v.o.)
               electra, listen!  you have got to
               come to the bank for the money!  the
               money!

     she is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back
     toward the stairs.

     just as she grabs the rail, she hears bain storming into
     the lobby below.

     she begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly.

     bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.
