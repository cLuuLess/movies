     int. cab

     rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat.  his other
     hand grips the door handle.

     as he waits, watching the intersection, he notices the
     cabby's id pinned to the dashboard.

     leaving the gun in his jacket, he reaches for the id card.

     he rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the
     seat, the door behind him opens.  someone gets in and
     closes the door.  rath peers into the rearview mirror.

     it is bain.

     for the first time we realize that the front and back of
     the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass.

     there is an awkward silence as rath sits, unsure.

     bain looks at him.

                             bain
               is there a problem?

                             rath
               no.  no problem.  the airport,
               right?

                             bain
               right.

     the cab pulls out of the intersection.
