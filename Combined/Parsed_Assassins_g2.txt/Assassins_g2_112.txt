     int. bathroom

     electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water
     running through her fingers as she adjusts the
     temperature.

     after a beat she hears a small crash, a glass breaking.
     it is followed by other muffled noises, a woman giggling
     and a thumping.  the sounds are coming from the other side
     of the tub wall, from the other suite.  electra puts her
     ear against the tile to listen.

     the water filling her tub is too loud for her to hear.
     she turns it off.

     there is more bumping and thumping, the woman laughing and
     then, the laughs shorten into soft whimpers.

     electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving
     up toward the over-head fan and ducts.

     the sounds get louder as she moves closer to the vents,
     until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub,
     listening to what is clearly the sounds of two people
     making love.

     their moans and shrieks climax and electra smiles.
