     int. bank

     a bank official walks over to the window, carrying a
     printed receipt, with a very bright smile.

                             official
               senor rath, we have received your
               transfer.

     he hands rath the receipt.  he glances at it, checking the
     zeros.  there are seven of them.

                             rath
               good.  now i'll need to close this
               account.  i'd like you to ready the
               paperwork.

     the smile fades.

                             official
               you wish to close this account
               today?

                             rath
               that's correct.

                             official
               how would you like the funds?

                             rath
               american currency.

                             official
               this will take some time.

                             rath
               i have all day.
