               it's irony.  that's what it is.  but
               the real irony is that you won't
               know it's irony until you're sitting
               over here.

     bain isn't listening.  instead he's watching, everyone who
     walks near them.

                             rath
               when you walked in here and you saw
               me, sitting here, waiting; the first
               thing that went through your head
               was that you were a dead man.

     this catches bain's ear.

                             rath
               you're thinking that you've been
               sold out.  that's the only way i
               could know you were out there.  why
               would you think this?  because you
               don't trust your contractor.  you
               don't trust anyone.  it's automatic.
               it's the first and last commandment.
               it's the only thing that keeps you
               alive.  so, try as i might to tell
               you the truth, you can't believe me.
               do you see the irony of the
               situation?  it's kind of funny,
               isn't it?

     bain is not laughing.
