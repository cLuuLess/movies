     int. lobby

     electra comes down the stairs.

     outside the large glass door she sees ken, jennifer's
     boyfriend, leaving.

     on the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under
     the door, addressed to jennifer morgan.

     electra looks out the front door window, making sure that
     ken is gone.

     she picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket.
