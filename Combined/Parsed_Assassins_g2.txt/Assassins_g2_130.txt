     ext. outdoor cafe

     the cafe is off the plaza.

     electra sits at a patio table.  down the street she can
     see the back of the burned-out hotel.

     she hears rath in her ear-piece.

                             rath (v.o.)
               all right.  i'm in the bank.  he'll
               move now.  how are you doing?

     she is nervous.

                             electra
               i'm ready.
