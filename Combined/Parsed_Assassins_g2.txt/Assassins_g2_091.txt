     int. hotel room

     electra and rath enter the room together but they are both
     immediately alone.

     she walks across the room to a chair in the corner,
     curling into it even as nikita jumps up and curls into her
     lap.

     he sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of
     the room and sits.

     they watch each other.  silence.

     between then is the liquor cabinet.  rath knows a good
     idea when he sees one.

                             rath
               want a drink?

     her face is as expressionless as nikita's.

     he pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down.
     takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.

                             rath
               okay...

     he returns to his table with his drink.

                             rath
               i'm not good at this sort of thing,
               but we don't have a lot of time, so
               i'll just go ahead and get started.
               first:  you.  i ask myself, 'what is
               she thinking?'

     her body tightens, coils.

                             rath
               simple.  she's scared.  she's almost
               been killed twice and now she is
               alone in a room with a man that she
               believes is an... assassin.

     another deep pull on the bourbon.

                             rath
               furthermore she was brought here not
               entirely on her own accord which
               only increases her fear and
               suspicion.  thus, as long as she is
               afraid, her first, maybe her only
               thought will be escape.  does that
               leave me any other option?

     he slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping
     out his gun.

                             rath
               no.

     crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it
     to her.  she looks at it.  back at him.

     he puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks
     to the bar.

     she picks up the gun.

                             rath
               the gun is silenced.  she could
               shoot me right now.

     she stands, nikita jumping from her lap.

                             rath
               she could take the car and be far
               from here before the maid comes in
               the morning, but --

     she starts squeezing off rounds; the lamp explodes, the
     chairs around him erupt, tufts of white stuffing leaping
     into the air.

                             electra
               shut up!

     he freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.

                             electra
               stop trying to tell me what i'm
               thinking!

     she moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.

                             electra
               i'll tell you what you're thinking
               -- you think i'm not going to shoot
               you but right now you're not so
               sure, are you?

     a slight shake of the head, no.

                             electra
               you're thinking that maybe it was a
               mistake to give me this gun, that
               maybe i'm not going to think about
               things logically because i'm a woman
               and i'm freaked out and i'm going to
               do something impulsive and
               irrational -- right?

     she fires the gun to both sides of his head.  he's
     surprised to be alive.

                             electra
               you don't know shit about me!  now
               sit down!

     he returns to his chair and sits with the same expression
     she had worn sitting a moment ago.

     she opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles
     of liquor.  she sucks it all down and throws the bottle
     across the room.

     grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.

                             electra
               okay.  how did you find me?

                             rath
               you're the computer hacker, you tell
               me.

                             electra
               you didn't know anything about me.

     nikita rubs up against her leg.

                             electra
               nikita?

                             rath
               yellow pages.  v for veterinarian.
               there aren't that many.

     she nods, slurping at her bottle.

                             electra
               you're one of them, aren't you?

                             rath
               'them'?

                             electra
               an assassin?

                             rath
               until a minute ago.

                             electra
               what does that mean?

                             rath
               if i still was what i used to be,
               you would not be pointing that at
               me.

     electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.

                             electra
               who is that other guy?

                             rath
               another contractor.

                             electra
               someone hired both of you?

                             rath
               no.  they hired bain.  the contract
               would have been mine, but bain took
               it from me as he took the previous
               one.

                             electra
               so this is something between you and
               him?

                             rath
               he stole the contract knowing that
               i would come after him.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               because he is trying to retire me.

                             electra
               he wants to kill you?

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               the nature of the business.  you
               remove your competition.

                             electra
               and you want to use me to get him?

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               forget it!

                             rath
               we don't have a choice.

     she fires the gun, pocking the wall behind him.

                             electra
               don't tell me i don't have a choice!

                             rath
               right.

                             electra
               i'm two seconds away from making my
               choice which means you've got two
               seconds to tell me why i shouldn't
               shoot you.

                             rath
               it's simple.  you need me.  i need
               you.  and we will both need money.

                             electra
               i don't need you to get the money --
               my money!

                             rath
               if it hadn't been for me, you would
               be dead.

     she's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.

                             electra
               i don't need the money.

                             rath
               this is something that is never
               going to end.  you can never work in
               the business again with this
               contract, because he will find you.
               to survive, you have to go into deep
               hiding.  and that's going to take
               money, a lot of money.

                             electra
               then you can have the disks and i'll
               just walk out that door --

                             rath
               if you walk out that door, bain will
               still come after you.

                             electra
               why?

                             rath
               because he took a contract on you.
               he'll come for you and he'll find
               you.

                             electra
               you don't know that -- you're trying
               to scare me.
     
                             rath
               no.  it's the truth.  i know what
               you are.  like me, like bain, you're
               a ghost, you're not part of the real
               world.  you don't have a social
               security number.  you don't pay
               taxes.  you've probably used ten
               different names over the last ten
               years.  a long time ago something
               probably happened, something illegal
               and you ran, you disappeared and it
               was easy.  you think you can do it
               again.  but i'm telling you, fading
               from the law is nothing.  no matter
               what you do, where you go, i swear
               to you that bain will find you.

                             electra
               how?

                             rath
               right now, as we sit here, he is
               tearing through your apartment.  he
               is digging through your drawers,
               emptying your closets.  he will take
               your telephone and address books,
               your appointment books.  if you keep
               a diary, he is reading it.  he'll go
               into the kitchen and find out what
               kind of food you eat, liquor you
               drink, cigarettes you smoke.  in the
               bathroom he will find any
               prescription drugs you take and
               where you get them filled.  if you
               have video tape or recordings he
               will watch and listen to all of
               them.

     she is coming unglued.  imagining him watching her tapes,
     going through her possessions.  she is moving, pacing,
     ready to explode.

                             electra
               oh jesus jesus...

                             rath
               he will know everything about you.
               everything.  i know, because i've
               done it.  once you've been inside a
               mark's home, you're in their head.
               if you're any good, you'll find the
               mark in a week, and bain is good
               because i was the best and i
               couldn't take him.

     she whirls and starts firing the gun, firing it
     everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in
     whistling hot wads of lead.

     when she stops, he starts to say something but she levels
     the gun at him.

                             electra
               shut up!  all right!  you've said
               enough!

     she forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample
     bottles.

                             electra
               i need to think... to be alone.

     with the gun and an armful of booze and nikita following
     at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the
     door.
