     int. burned hotel

     electra turns into the hotel room just as bain reaches the
     fifth floor.  there is no time.
     
     she slips into the closet, as bain whips around the corner
     into the room.  he rushes to the window, slamming himself
     against it.

                             bain
               you're gonna take me?  come on!
               come on, motherfucker!

     he bends down and from the hole that he fell into, pulls
     out the assault rifle.

                             bain
               take this!  take this, you fuck!

     electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood
     lathe.

     he pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through
     the wall.

                             bain
               motherfucker!

     he stands suddenly, perfectly still, gun aimed at the
     bank.

                             bain
               comeon-comeon-comeone-it'sover-
               gameover-comeon.
