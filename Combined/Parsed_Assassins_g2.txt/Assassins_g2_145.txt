     int. burned hotel room

     bain is rocking back and forth, breathing through his
     teeth.  he has to urinate.  bad.

     he is checking every face that comes out of the bank with
     the scope.  still nothing.

                             bain
               this is fucking insane.

     he grabs the empty plastic bottle, unzips his pants and
     begins refilling it.

     a man in a suit appears on the steps and bain fumbles the
     bottle, spilling it as he lifts the gun.  it is not rath.

                             bain
               fucking god dammit!

     he hurls the bottle of piss across the room.
