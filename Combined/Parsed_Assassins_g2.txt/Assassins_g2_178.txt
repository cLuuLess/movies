     int. burned hotel

     bain is twisting in mid-air, diving as --

     she fires again, moving at him.  a chunk of wood explodes
     as she misses.

     he falls, the burned floor shattering, charred joists
     shearing with the sound of breaking glass.

     she watches him fall through, hears him hit the floor
     below, ash and wood clattering around him.

     the gun trained on the hole, she peers over the edge, but
     he is gone.
