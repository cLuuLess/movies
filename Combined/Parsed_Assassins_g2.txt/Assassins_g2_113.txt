     int. bedroom

     it is dark now.  a single desk light is on, under which
     rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in
     their familiar pattern.

     electra comes out of the bathroom.  she seems very clean
     and fresh, wearing a long white t-shirt and thin robe.

                             electra
               that felt great.  you should try it.

     she watches him setting the pieces onto the board.

                             electra
               don't you ever get tired of playing
               the same game?

     he looks at her.

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               why not?

                             rath
               it helps me to focus.  it centers
               me, helps me think.

                             electra
               oh.  what do you think about?

                             rath
               work.  the things i need to get
               done.

     she sits across from him looking at the board.

                             electra
               do you think about the game?

                             rath
               yes.

                             electra
               but you've never figured out a way
               to win.

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               not even a stalemate?

                             rath
               no.

                             electra
               what happens if you do?

     this strikes rath as a very strange question and he is
     suddenly annoyed by her.

                             electra
               can i ask you something?

     he knows she will anyway.

                             electra
               what will you do if this works, if
               we get the money?

                             rath
               i don't know... maybe i'll live on a
               boat, sail to all the places i've
               never been.

                             electra
               that sounds nice.

     he finishes his glass of bourbon.

     she is not sure what to say next, if she should say
     anything at all.

                             electra
               i'm kind of tired.  i think i'd like
               to try and get some sleep.

                             rath
               you can have the bed.  the chair is
               fine for me.

     he pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from
     the ice bucket.

                             electra
               thanks.

     she slips out of the robe and in between the sheets.

     rath sits across the room, his back to her.

     she tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.

                             electra
               do you think he's here?

                             rath
               here?

                             electra
               in costa blanca.

                             rath
               yes.

     she thinks.

                             electra
               what do you think he's doing?

                             rath
               i don't know... but i'm sure he's
               not sleeping.

     she pulls the covers tightly to her chin.  her eyes do not
     close.
