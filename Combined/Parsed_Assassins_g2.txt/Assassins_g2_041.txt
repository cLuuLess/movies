     int. electra's apartment

     on the monitors, electra watches jennifer pick up the
     phone.

                             jennifer (v.o.)
               hi, mom, it's me.  ken and i just
               had a big fight.

     electra's pager suddenly sounds.  she shuts down the
     screens and pulls out the pager, checking the number.

                             electra
               crap.
