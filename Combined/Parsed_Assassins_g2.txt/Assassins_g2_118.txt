     int. hotel room - day

     rath is still at the table.

     the curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing
     through the open patio door.  they swell open and fall.
     it seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in
     the changing shape of the curtain.

     rath stands.  he walks to the open door.  standing in the
     frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below.

     he slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still.
