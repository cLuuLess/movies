     int. patrol car

     bain stares out the window, silent.

     behind his back, he takes hold of his left thumb with his
     right hand.

     the cop is playing with the gameboy.

     with a quick jerk, he yanks the thumb out of its socket.
     his expression remains perfectly blank.

     the thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand.  the skin
     stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his
     wrist.

     the cop turns as the switchblade clicks and bain sticks
     the knife through the wire mesh, into the cop's eye.  a
     font of blood arcs onto the windshield.

     grabbing hold of the driver's shirt collar, bain jabs the
     blade into the back of his neck.

     the driver screams trying to pull free of bain's grip.

     he slams on the brakes, groping for his gun and the car
     skids out of control.

     bain stabs the cop again, his gun firing wildly as --

     the patrol car starts to flip and roll.
