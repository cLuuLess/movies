     int. electra's apartment lobby

     standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is
     jennifer morgan.  what she was hoping for is not there.
     she looks up and sees electra.

                             jennifer
               excuse me --

     electra stops.

                             jennifer
               you live here, don't you?

     electra nods.

                             jennifer
               i'm sorry, this may sound really
               weird, but my friend told me he
               slipped a letter under the door here
               and i was wondering if you happened
               to see it?

     electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket.

                             electra
               letter?

                             jennifer
               yeah.  he said he saw a woman with
               dark hair going into the building
               when he dropped it off.

                             electra
               no.  i don't have it.

     electra's mouth opens and she backs away.  jennifer is
     bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.

                             jennifer
               i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to -- i'm
               sorry.

     she shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving electra
     in the lobby.

     electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to
     pocket.

     a worried expression tightens her face; the letter is
     gone.

     she opens the interior door, following jennifer up the
     stairs.
