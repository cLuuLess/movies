     ext. city street

     the cars screech to a halt in front of the restaurant.
     the cops jump out, drawing their weapons.

     bain throws his guns down, raising his hands in the air.

                             bain
               don't shoot!  don't shoot!  i give
               up!

     more cars come screeching up as the two officers hold
     their beads on bain.

                             cop
               hit the ground!  face down!  spread
               your legs!

     bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him,
     frisking him.  in this position the cop is unable to find
     the knife strapped to bain's forearm, but finds the
     gameboy.

                             bain
               hey, don't touch that!

                             cop
               shut up!

     the cop twists bain's arms behind his back, handcuffing
     him tightly.

     they drag him to his feet, a swarm of police and
     paramedics in the street.
