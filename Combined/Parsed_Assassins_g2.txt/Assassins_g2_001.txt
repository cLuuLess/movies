     ext. marsh - sunglasses - dusk

     the red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.

     two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
     less marsh.  it is fall, the first frost not far away and
     the foliage is brown and bare.  with the red-orange ball
     of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first
     appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
     mire.

     the man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.
     he is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  a .22 caliber
     gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.

     his name is robert rath.

     the other man is willie ketcham.  he is also wearing a
     very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
     brambles and mud.

     as he lifts his foot his gucci shoe is sucked off by the
     mud.

                             ketcham
               aw-shit!

     he balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in
     the air.  he looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.
     he looks at rath.

                             ketcham
               how much farther?

                             rath
               just a little ways.  up to those
               trees.

     about a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
     is a small cluster of trees.

                             ketcham
               oh, fuck it.

     he pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.
     he smiles.  it feels good.  he hurls the sock.  lifting
     his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  he
     grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,
     laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.

     rath waits, a faint smile.

     he manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
     both feet into the dark, wet earth.

                             ketcham
               hey, this feels kinda good.

     they move on, ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet
     deep pulling them out to make a splurching, sucking noise.

                             ketcham
               hey, do you mind if i talk a
               little?  i feel like, i don't
               know, talking i guess.

                             rath
               sure.

                             ketcham
               funny, i've never been a talker.
               my wife was always getting on me
               about that.  'say what you feel,
               tell me what's bothering you,
               you ve got to talk to me.'  i
               never would though.  not really.

                               rath
               why not?

                               ketcham
               i don't know.  part of me wanted
               to but part of me always said,
               'what's she going to be able to
               do?'  i don't know.  maybe i
               didn't trust her.

     he picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
     snowball.

                             ketcham
               my margaret... i loved her but you
               know what?  i cheated on her.  all
               the time.  i don't even know why.
               it wasn't the sex, margaret was
               great in bed.  i think if i wasn't
               married i wouldn't have even looked
               at some of those women.  i knew she
               couldn't trust me, so how could i
               trust her?  if she was here right
               now i'd think that i would tell her
               that i was sorry... 'course, if she
               were here right now, maybe i
               wouldn't feel like talking.

     he throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are
     too far.

                             ketcham
               i think i've heard of you.

                             rath
               it's possible.

                             ketcham
               you're pretty famous aren't you?

                             rath
               i hope not.

                             ketcham
               i know this may seem like a strange
               question, but can i ask you how
               much the contract was for -- not
               to insult you or anything, i know
               you're a professional, but just
               for me, i was just wondering.

                             rath
               it's a common question.

                             ketcham
               oh yeah?  i guess we still need to
               see that price tag.  like art,
               right?  you hang some painting
               that looks like baby-puke in your
               living room only if it costs a
               bundle.

                             rath
               a dime.

                             ketcham
               one hundred thousand?  that's it?
               jesus... is that a lot?

                             rath
               average.

                             ketcham
               shit... oh well.

     ketcham laughs.

                             ketcham
               i have been thinking about this
               for a long while.  i knew this day
               was coming.  i knew someday
               someone would make the call on me.
               i never thought about anyone that
               i had whacked.  what do you call
               it anyway?

                             rath
               taken.

                             ketcham
               'taken.'  that's nice.  when i had
               someone taken i would call our
               general contractor, transfer the
               money and as soon as i hung up the
               phone i forgot about them.

                             rath
               everyone who plays the game knows
               the rules.

                             ketcham
               that's exactly what i told myself.

     ketcham laughs again.  he is getting kind of giggly, like
     he's high.

                             ketcham
               i always wondered what i'd be
               thinking at this exact moment.  i
               imagined that i would be thinking
               about the fucker who contracted
               this, trying to figure out who
               it was...

     something occurs to him and he looks back at rath.

                             rath
               don't know.  that's how it works.

                             ketcham
               that's what our general contractor
               told us but how can you trust
               someone like that?

                             rath
               right.

                             ketcham
               i thought that i would be thinking
               about margaret, or work, or that
               i'd be having these deep, profound
               and depressing thoughts but i'm
               not.  i'm trying to think really
               profound thoughts, but i can't.
               it seems very funny to me.

                             rath
               what are you thinking about?

                             ketcham
               i'm thinking about moonpies.  ain't
               that funny?  i haven't had a
               moonpie since i was ten years old.
               right now, i'm thinking how much
               i'd love one.

                             rath
               and an r.c.

     he's 'laughing' and rath laughs with him.  ketcham suddenly
     stops laughing.  they are nearly to the cluster of trees.

                             ketcham
               can i ask you something?

                             rath
               go ahead.

                             ketcham
               what do other guys do?

     he looks at the trees, his voice dying in the wind.

                             rath
               everyone handles it differently.
               some are ready, some are not.

                             ketcham
               do they get down on their knees,
               begging and crying?

                             rath
               some.

                             ketcham
               when i thought about this, that
               was always there, in the back of
               my head, that image of me on my
               knees, crying.  it wouldn't go
               away and it would really upset me.
               it was something that i could never
               get away from... but now, i feel
               it's okay.  i feel good.

                             rath
               can i ask you a question?

                             ketcham
               anything.

                             rath
               why didn't you fade?

                              ketcham
               you mean quit?

                              rath
               yeah.

                              ketcham
               i used to think about it.  i had
               margaret.  she wanted kids.  i
               thought about moving somewhere
               far away like, europe.  i could
               see all of that, the first part,
               the getting away but i couldn't
               see that next part.  'then what?'
               so i'd stop thinking about it and
               go back to work.  you understand?

                             rath
               yeah.

     ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
     trees.

                             ketcham
               i always pictured that i would end
               in some land fill, under
               someone else's garbage.  i kept
               picturing those plastic diapers
               filled with some baby's green shit,
               covering me.  but this is nice...

     he looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black
     horizon.

                               ketcham
               look at that.  i haven't watched
               the sun set in a million years.
               do you mind?

                             rath
               no.

     ketcham stares at the last of the light.

                             ketcham
               nice... real nice.

     with his face hidden from rath he begins to cry.

     rath watches ketcham staring at the setting sun.  rath
     looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.

     when the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
     ening sky, we hear the gun, silenced, once, then the body
     falling into the mud.  after a beat we hear two more
     shots.

     ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,
     a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
     left by the dying sun.

     rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-
     ing alone in the middle of nowhere.
