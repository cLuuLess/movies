     int. costa blanca hotel - night

     bain is doing push ups.  he is naked except for his
     camouflage bikinis.

     he has his feet up on a chair, making it harder, the dip
     deeper.

     his body is gushing sweat, his face a burning red.

     he is like a piston firing up and down.  the muscles in
     his neck and shoulders are bulging cords.

     slowly, his arm begin to tire, the strain seen in his
     knotting and twisting expression.

     half way up, he collapses, feet falling off the chair.

     he rolls onto his back, rubbing a tricep.  it hurts.  he
     licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles.
