     int. cheap hotel - night

     the room is ugly.  shag carpeting, wood paneling and
     polyester patterned curtains.

     we hear a computer keyboard clicking away as we move
     across a table.  the hotel phone is in a modem, which is
     held together with duct tape.  between the modem and the
     computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of
     naked circuit boards.

     it is a very similar set up to rath's, only it has been
     put together with a fraction of the resources.

     bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off.  beside
     the desk-top is a six pack of old style beer, a bag of
     doritos and his gameboy.

     on the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel
     is his cleaned gun.

     bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down
     his beer.

                             contractor/screen
               where have you been, michael?

     he belches.

     he is communicating with his general contractor.

     on the table is a collection of personal objects, much of
     it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from electra's house.

                             bain/screen
               tracking the mark.

     bain fingers a pair of satin panties.  he smiles as he
     smells them.

                             bain
               i'm on the scent.

                             contractor/screen
               you're too late.

     bain slams his beer down.

                             contractor/screen
               i've learned from microcell, rath
               fulfilled the contract.

                             bain/screen
               how?

                             contractor/screen
               he took out the mark and sold the
               disks back to microcell.

     bain falls back in his chair, thinking.  he runs his hands
     through his sweaty hair.

                             contractor/screen
               michael?

                             bain
               no.  no.  no.  i don't believe it.

                             contractor/screen
               they money will be standard bank
               transfer.  we believe we will know
               where and when.

                             bain
               what?

                             bain/screen
               how?

     there is no response.

                             bain/screen
               how in the fuck do you know that?

     a long beat.

                             contractor/screen
               such language in front of a lady.

                             bain
               i don't give a fuck what you are.  i
               asked you --

     he hits the repeat key.

                             bain
                       (types)
               how in the fuck do you know that?

                             contractor/screen
               do you want rath or not?

     bain stares at the screen, thinking.  thinking hard.
