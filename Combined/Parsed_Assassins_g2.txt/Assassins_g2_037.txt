     int. cab

     rath studies bain.  there is a thin line of blood down his
     temple.  bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his
     gameboy, resuming his game of tetris.

                             rath
               how'd you cut yourself?

     their voices are distorted through the small electric
     amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal
     money exchanger.

     bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a
     bit surprised.

                             bain
               oh?  working.  a little accident.

     he wipes it off as best he can.

                             rath
               you a waiter?  you look like a
               waiter.

     bain is uninterested.

                             bain
               yeah.  yeah, i'm a waiter.

                             rath
               where?

                             bain
               what?

                             rath
               what restaurant?

                             bain
               uh, fontella's

                             rath
               so you're from around here?

                             bain
               no.  no i'm not.

     bain is getting agitated.

                             rath
               where you from?

                             bain
               what is this?

                             rath
               not too good at small talk, eh?

                             bain
               look, i'm real tired and i'm not
               interested in fucking chit-chat.

                             rath
               i know just what you mean.  i'm
               pretty beat myself.

     silence.

                             rath
               since you looked like a waiter, i
               had to ask what restaurant because
               of what happened at the trattoria
               roma.

     bain looks up.

                             bain
               why?  what happened?

                             rath
               didn't you here all them sirens?
               it's been all over the radio.  some
               guy shot leevio valli, and a bunch
               of bystanders, in the trattoria
               roma.

                             bain
               no shit.

                             rath
               yeah, it's terrible.  i mean valli,
               and i don't care what office he's
               running for, the guy's a crook.  he
               probably had it coming, but all the
               other people.  real sad.

                             bain
               yeah.

                             rath
               but they caught the guy.  i heard it
               all.  sounded like he just went
               berserk, fucking loco.  shooting
               anybody.  drugs, probably.

                             bain
               probably.

                             rath
               i'd love to sit in that jury.  send
               that s.o.b. right to the chair.

     bain allows himself a bemused smile.

                             bain
               sizzle lean.

     the cab passes the intersection for the airport.

     bain sits up.

                             bain
               what are you doing?

                             rath
               what?

                             bain
               that was peterson back there.  that
               goes to the expressway for the
               airport.

                             rath
               you're right.  talking too much
               again.

                             bain
               yeah well, you just blew your tip,
               pal.

                             rath
               what?  you think i'm running you up?

                             bain
               just do your job.

     rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park.

                             bain
               what are you doing?

                             rath
               get out.  you think i'm running you
               up?  get out.

                             bain
               you can't --

                             rath
               the hell i can't.  it's my cab.  i
               don't like you.  so, get the hell
               out!

     bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the
     dashboard and the missing id.

     their eyes meet in the rearview mirror.

                             bain
               holy fucking shit!

     the cab rocks as both men move.  instantly guns fill their
     hands.  bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the
     dead cops.  rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free
     from his jacket.

     bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops.  he
     looks at rath.  he wants him to run.  anyone who moves
     away from the bullet proof glass is dead.

     both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun
     sights.

     bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.

                             bain
               i get out, you got me.

     bain reaches over and closes the door.  he smiles knowing
     it is the right move.

                             bain
               now what?

     rath calmly uncocks his gun.

                             rath
               we're both going to the airport.

     bain nods.

                             rath
               sit back.  put your seatbelt on.

                             bain
               no fucking way.

                             rath
               okay, don't.

     bain thinks.

                             rath
               if either of us fucks around, the
               other can blow the fuel line.

     he points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs.

     bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching rath.

     rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his
     gun on the fuel line.

     he puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic,
     turning back towards peterson.

     they sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit
     the expressway.  bain can't contain himself, giddy on
     adrenaline.

                             bain
               jesus -- i'm being driven to the
               airport by robert rath.

     he laughs.

                             bain
               i can't believe this.  you rolled
               some cabby for the radio, then
               waited for an airport fare.

     he laughs again.

                             bain
               boy, that's fucking genius.  you're
               a fucking genius.  then you're just
               sitting there, bullshitting with me.
               man, no way i coulda done that!

                             rath
               what's your name?  we both know it's
               not nicholai.

                             bain
               holy shit!  robert rath wants to
               know my name.

     he leans back.  this is a big moment for him.

                             bain
               bain.  michael bain.

                             rath
               how long have you been freelance?

                             bain
               two years.  two long fucking years.

     something occurs to him and he leans close to the window.

                             bain
               hey.  what i don't get was why
               didn't you take the shot inside the
               restaurant?  i mean you had me, a
               free shot.  that's what i would have
               done.

                             rath
               it's just a shoot-out then.  sixty-
               forty, at best.  not my odds.

                             bain
               sounds like chickenshit --

     he laughs hard.

                             bain
               listen to me calling you
               chickenshit!

     he stops laughing and looks closely at the back of rath's
     head.

                             bain
               is that a wig?  shit, i hate wigs!
               wigs are the worst part of this job.
               i'd rather dye my hair than wear a
               wig.

     rath studies him.

                             rath
               you're wearing a wig now.

     bain chokes on his laugh.

                             bain
               god damn are you good.  everyone
               says you're so fucking good.  i just
               can't believe i'm still alive.  if i
               believed in god, i'd be down on my
               knees.  right now -- hey, how come
               you just didn't plug us all when we
               came through the door?

     rath does not answer.  bain smiles.  he knows something
     about rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.

                             bain
               shit if i was you, back there --

     he holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind rath's
     head.

                             bain
               game over.

     he laughs.

                             bain
               do you mind if i ask you a couple of
               business questions?  you know i was
               wondering how much you bid this job
               at?

     rath says nothing.

                             bain
               you don't have to tell me that.
               it's just, i know my bid was low,
               but was it too low?  i mean, did i
               seem like an amateur, like i didn't
               know what i was doing?

                             rath
               we both know what you were doing.

     bain moves close to the glass again, checking out rath's
     gun.

                             bain
               smith and wesson .22 with an eight
               inch silencer.  classic.  when i
               first heard you used that, i
               thought, shit, that's a lady's gun.
               now, it's all i use.  clean, real
               clean.

     he looks at the gun, still trained at the floor.

                             bain
               would you really blow us?

     rath does not have to answer.

                             bain
               oh!  i got a question.  jesus, this
               has been driving me crazy for years
               -- shit, listen to me.  i sound like
               some fucking fanboy.  i'm sorry, but
               i just got to ask you.  everybody
               talks about how you left the agency
               and got into the business and then
               how you went after the russian,
               nicholai talinkov --

                             rath
               tachlinkov.

                             bain
               yeah, that's it.  and he's like a
               fucking genius.  they said he shaded
               you over and over.  and in the end,
               he aced you again.  shaded and
               faded.  they say he's living on some
               greek island, but i say that's
               fucking bullshit.  i say you're the
               best and that you planted his ass.
               am i right?

     rath says nothing.

                             bain
               i bet i'm right.

     the car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the
     cleveland airport.

                             bain
               robert bain, driving me!  jesus
               fucking christ!

                             rath
               after those cops, you'll never be
               able to come back to cleveland.

                             bain
               who the fuck cares about cleveland.
               cleveland blows.  what kind of marks
               have they got here?  greasy mobster,
               teamster or some hand job
               politician.  i want the money marks.
               i want the marks that you get.

     a long beat of silence.

     the cab rumbles up onto the "departures" ramp which
     circles past all of the terminals.

                             bain
               so what happens now?

                             rath
               we go around once.

                             bain
               bullshit.

     he throws off his seatbelt.

                             bain
               you tell me that we're gonna go
               around once, then, while i'm
               checking out the lay of the land,
               you bail out and send me flying over
               the bridge.  right?  am i right?

     rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the
     police and airport security.

     rath studies the terrain.  bain studies rath.

     soon they have passed the entire airport.  rath nods.
     steering the car through traffic in onto a circle
     interchange that will bring them to the beginning.

     bain wipes the sweat from his face.

                             rath
               okay.

                             bain
               what?  what's okay?

     rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.

                             bain
               what are you doing?

                             rath
               there's a sand barricade up ahead;
               i'm going to ram this cab into it.
               the cab has an airbag, odds are good
               i'll survive.  but with this steel
               casing and bullet proof glass, odds
               for you are not so good.

     bain laughs.

                             bain
               oh man, that's sweet.  that's
               fucking sweet.

     the speedometer continues to climb.

                             bain
               you're bluffing.

     rath says nothing.  ahead, at the ramp to the terminals,
     is the sand barricade.

                             bain
               you're fucking with me.  you want me
               to jump.  i jump, you hit the brakes
               and bang -- game over.

     the cab is flying at its target.

                             bain
               no, no.  wait.  you don't want me to
               jump.  you're going to jump.  i'm
               stuck back here until it's too late.
               wham -- over!

                             rath
               i know you're going to jump.

     bain looks at him and then at the barricade.

                             rath
               you're still young.  young enough to
               still think you're indestructible.
               invincible.  you believe with utter
               certainty you can bail out at the
               last second and survive.

     the barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the
     windshield.

                             rath
               if you do survive, we'll see each
               other again.

     bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself
     out.

     rath jams on the brakes, tires screaming, steering into
     the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of
     sand as --

     bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped
     across water.

     a driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him.

     sand explodes from the impact and the cab bounces up over
     the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag
     balloons out of the steering wheel.

     bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a
     piece of roadkill.

     the cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the
     radiator spitting out a cloud of whistling steam.

     several cars lock up and collide to avoid bain; one car
     stopping inches from him.  a woman jumps out, rushing to
     the front of the car, but bain is gone.

     police cars roar up into the midst of the accident.  one
     of them pulling alongside the demolished cab.  the door is
     open, the airbag popped.  rath is gone.
