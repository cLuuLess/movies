               you're a businessman, right?  this
               is a business deal.  behind that
               counter, i have over ten million
               dollars.  i'll give you half of it,
               more money than you'll make in the
               next ten years if, you walk away.

     bain's face changes, muscles relaxing, the tension
     slipping out of him.

                             bain
               five million dollars?

                             rath
               that's right.

                             bain
               shit.  that sure is a lot of money.

     bain is smiling.

                             rath
               did you see how i did that?  magic
               wasn't it?

                             bain
               what?

                             rath
               you understand what's going on?  it
               makes sense, right?

                             bain
               oh, yeah.

                             rath
               what i just said, no assassin would
               say.  what i've said, only a mark
               would say.

     they stare at each other.

                             bain
               you think i would be an idiot to
               pass up five million dollars.

                             rath
               you would be.

                             bain
               you don't know a fucking thing about
               me.  you don't have the slightest
               fucking clue.

                             rath
               why don't you tell me.

                             bain
               i'll tell you this.  after
               cleveland, i thought i was lucky to
               be alive.  but now, here, i just
               realized that you were the lucky
               one.

                             rath
               now i'll tell you something.  it
               wouldn't fucking matter if i offered
               you one hundred million dollars.
               you'd still be thinking the same
               thing, that you're going to take me.
               and here i am, sitting through this,
               knowing it's bullshit, looking at
               you and the only thing going on in
               my mind, the only thing i can think
               is that, in just a few minutes i'm
               going to take you.

     bain jumps out of the seat.

                             bain
               yeah, okay!  i'm ready!  let's
               fucking go!

     he's walking, turning, watching everything, everyone.
     he's out the door.
