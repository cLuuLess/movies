     int. hotel paraiso elevator

     on one side of the elevator is a young couple who look
     like newlyweds.  they are cuddling, kissing and giggling
     as though they are alone.

     electra and rath are on the other side of the elevator.
     it is a strange contrast.

     electra is staring at them.

     rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world.

     the elevator chimes and opens.

     nobody moves.

     the doors chime again and start to close, as everyone
     realizes that this is their floor.

     rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back
     open.

     it is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and
     smiles politely, on the way out.
