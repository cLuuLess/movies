     int. electra's car - night

     the red "low fuel" light is on.

                             electra
               now what?

                             rath
               turn off the engine.

     electra twists the ignition and the car dies.  rath
     glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas
     station.

                             electra
               you want me to pump?

                             rath
               no, stay in the car.  i want you to
               understand something.  if i intended
               to kill you, you would already be
               dead.

     electra says nothing.

     he reaches over and takes the car keys.

     when he is out of the car, electra slowly releases the
     strangle-hold she had on the steering wheel.

                             electra
               okay, nikita, stay calm, think,
               breathe, think...

     electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as rath
     pumps the gas.  her eyes flash down to her bag.

     outside, rath watches electra through the windows.  she
     appears motionless.

     the electric gas counter races like a stop watch.

     in the car, electra eases her hand into her bag.

     the tank full, rath re-hangs the pump.  he walks around
     the car and heads for the station.

     electra waits until his back is turned.  she pulls her
     tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire
     stripper.  reaching under the dash, she yanks out a
     tangled handful of wire.

     she looks up; rath is inside paying.

                             electra
               come on, come on, it's a cake walk.

     her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping,
     stripping, twisting.

     rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking
     for him.  it takes only a second for him to realize what
     she is doing.

                             rath
               oh shit.

     he runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and
     strikes them; the battery grinds.

                             electra
               please, please.

     he is almost there when the engine fires.  she stomps on
     the gas, ramming the shift into drive.

     tires squealing, the car swerves forward as rath slams
     into it.  he bounces backward, falling to the ground.

     the car fishtails away, accelerating as rath rolls to one
     knee, his gun automatically in his hand.  he draws a bead,
     but, he does not shoot.

     with a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.

                             rath
               dammit.
