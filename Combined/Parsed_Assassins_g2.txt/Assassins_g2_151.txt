     int. bank

     bain charges into the bank, tearing off his sunglasses,
     scanning the room.  his face is a twisted grimace,
     streaked with black charcoal.  his body and clothes are
     covered in sweat and large salt rings.  his breathing
     labored.

     he sees rath sitting comfortably, calm, his suit not even
     wrinkled and realizes that rath has been waiting for him.

     his first instinct is to turn and run, but he stops
     himself.  he is confused, unsure.

     then, as though understanding he has no choice, he puts
     his sunglasses back on and strides over to rath, boots
     clicking against the polished marble.

     bain sits down in the leather chair across from him.

                             bain
               how'd you know?  just tell me that.
               how'd you fucking know?

                             rath
               i knew the same way in ten years
               you're going to know.

                             bain
               what does that fucking mean?

                             rath
               it means that i'm going to tell you
               things, even though i already know
               that you're not going to listen to a
               god damned thing i say.
