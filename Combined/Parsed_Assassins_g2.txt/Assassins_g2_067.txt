     int. hyatt hall

     bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of
     "tetris."

     suddenly, he stops.

                             bain
               yes!

     the display of the game reads "game over" and
     congratulates bain on a new high score.

     bain stands, smiling.  he puts the game in his pocket and
     starts down the hall.
