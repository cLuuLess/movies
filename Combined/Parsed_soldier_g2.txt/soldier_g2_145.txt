     int.  corridor - night

     sally and red are guarding a door to the trench when a clanking
     noise in the corridor behind them makes them turn and look.
     their jaws go slack with amazement.

     clanking toward them is todd, so armored and laden with fighting
     gear he looks almost like a medieval knight!  he says nothing as
     he looms closer to then, heading for the door.  the two of then
     shrink hastily out of his way.
