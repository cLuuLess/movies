     int.  earthen corridor/settlement - night

     someone is dragging a corpse down the smoky, lamplit corridor as 
     little nathan watches sandra tending to the bloody wounds of a
     pioneer lying on the floor.  as the corpse is dragged past
     nathan, the lifeless, vacant eyes stare right at the
     uncomprehending little boy.

     nathan sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, angie, sobbing
     uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds.  sandra is
     trying to help with the bandages and console angie at the same
     time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people groan
     and children cry out.

     nathan doesn't understand it, it's confusing.  men and women loom
     past him.  he wobbles off down the corridor, toddling away from
     the sounds of pain.

     shuk!  ka-shuk!  strange sounds come from a doorway ahead, the
     doorway to the meeting room.  chak!  klak!  shik chik ka chik!
     the sound of metal and metal, metal parts clicking and sliding.

     alone in the corridor, nathan toddles innocently forward, toward
     the sounds.
