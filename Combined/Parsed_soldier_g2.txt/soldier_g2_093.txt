     int.  crew quarters/"daddy" - day

     an oval hatch door swings open and sloan enters.

     veterans in coveralls, slumped or sprawled on steel-tiered bunks,
     scramble obediently to their feet, eyes on sloam.

                                   sloan
                   suit up, fellas.  time to go build
                   another play house.

     as veterans start to pull space suits from under the bunks, sloan
     turns her back on them...but hesitates before exiting as though
     expecting something.  sure enough, veteran riley speaks up.

                                   riley
                   sir.

                                   sloan
                   yes, riley, what is it?

     sloan says it even before she's turned.  she knew who it would
     be.
                                   riley
                   we haven't been issued weapons, sir.

                                   sloan
                         (as to a child)
                   you won't need weapons, riley.
                   you're not soldiers anymore.

                                   riley
                         (saluting)
                   yes, sir.

                                   sloan
                   you don't even have to salute
                   anymore.  a simple "yes, sir" will
                   do.

     riley swallows hard and with effort keeps his hand from saluting
     as he speaks.

                                   riley
                   y-yes...sir.

     sloan turns her back and exits.

     as the door closes, riley, unable to restrain himself any longer, 
     salutes hastily as we...

                                                       cut to:
