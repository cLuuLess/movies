     int.  dining commons/settlement

     red charges into the commons, shouting excitedly.

                                   red
                   they stopped shooting!  they stopped
                   shooting!

     he stops abruptly, seeing...

     a blazing fire, whipped by wind from a shel hole in the ceiling, 
     consuming tables in the far half of the commons...

     while jimmy pig, slade and sandra struggle with one end of a huge
     beam that's fallen at an angle on top of a trap door in the floor,
     the root cellar.

     ellen, with nathan in her arms, tommy, will, johnny and other
     children hover behind her, staring at...

     a six inch opening between the floor and the trap door where
     emma, judith and other children, unable to squeeze through the
     six inch gap, peer out with frightened eyes, trapped.

                                   red
                         (dampened)
                   they stopped shooting!

                                   jimmy pig
                         (to red)
                   give us a hand, dammit!

     as red joins the effort.  slade snaps at him sarcastically as he 
     strains against the heavy beam.

                                   slade
                   you think (grunt) that's good they
                   stopped?  it means (grunt) they're
                   comin' for us!  to (grunt) kill us!
                   that's good news, you think?

                                   sandra
                         (looking for hope)
                   sergeant todd (grunt, cough) said...

                                   slade
                   that he's gonna (grunt) stomp a whole
                   army?  couldn't if he wanted.

     the smoke is getting thicker.  emma and judith are coughing, 
     looking scared.

                                   sandra
                   he (grunt) knew them!  he said --

                                   slade
                   he's dead!  if he isn't (grunt)
                   dead, he joined 'em.  he don't
                   (grunt) care about us, he's a
                   soldier.  besides, we threw him out,
                   remember?

     sandra pushes at the beam with all her strength, fighting back
     tears of despair.

                                   sandra
                   he's not dead!

     the massive beam won't budge!  eyes wide with terror, emma and
     ruth peer out of their trap.

                                                       cut to:
