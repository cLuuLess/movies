     int.  bowels of the ship - night

     the timer on the bomb clicks into action, ticking off seconds and 
     blurring off the tenths.

     angle on sloan, punching a code into the device as she addresses
     the four veterans.

                                   sloan
                    okay, fellas, take it about a
                    hundred yards, then get back on the
                    double...unless you wanna fry.

     riley, his face impassive, opens a hatch, revealing the darkness

                    thirty minutes is awful tight!  we
                    have to launch and get clear of the
                    atmosphere.

                                   church
                    it's enough.  if we leave more than
                    enough, the enemy may get clear
                    somehow as well.

     as sloan shuts the hatch, she checks her watch.
