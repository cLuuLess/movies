     emma is ushering children through a trap door in the floor into
     the root cellar as jimmy pig ushers johnny into the room.

                                   johnny
                   where's my father?  where's my
                   father?

     johnny looks around urgently.

     sandra is bandaging tommy's arm while ellen, nathan, and will are
     huddling under a table in the most protected corner of the room.

     jimmy pig and judith exchange a pained look as jimmy pig pushes
     johnny toward sandra and the table.

                                   jimmy pig
                   johnny, get over under that table
                   with miss sandra and ellen and the
                   others.  miss judith, you better go
                   on down the root cellar with emma
                   and help with the ones down there.

                                   johnny
                   where's my mother?

     bah-dooom!  another fierce concussion twenty yards away shakes
     dirt from the ceiling.  ellen beckons from under the table...

                                   ellen
                   come on, johnny.
