     todd's head, caked with blood, appears from the junk like a man
     looking out of a cave.  wind seizes at his hair furiously.

     he looks up, sees four pale suns in the sky...just as a huge
     steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose

     far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of lines...and
     moving along one of the lines are four tiny figures...they could
     be humans...but maybe not!
