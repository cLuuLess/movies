     int.  cockpit/"daddy" - night

     church is in the cockpit now, hovering behind rubrick who's
     speaking urging into the radio mike.

                                   rubrick
                   this is daddy, come in, number two.
                   daddy calling number two...

                                   church
                   what about number one?  try
                   number...

                                   rubrick
                   i tried one.  i can't get either
                   one of them.

     sloan is pacing, looks sick to her stomach with fear.

                                   sloan
                   there was...some kind of...
                   guerilla action...

                                   rubrick
                   then we lost them...

     now church is pacing back and forth, panicky, ranting...

                                   church
                   you should have waked me sooner!
                   this is bad, very bad.  i never
                   should have let that clown mekum
                   test his wonder boy army on me.  "if
                   it ain't broke, don't fix it."
                   shit!  we don't even know what we're
                   up against.  how many...?

                                   sloan
                   we couldn't get any figures on enemy
                   troop strength.

                                   rubrick
                   not even estimates...

                                   church
                   we're sitting ducks here!  there
                   could be a couple of divisions!
                   more!  we don't even have the
                   weapons to arm the old soldiers.

                                   rubrick
                         (into the mike,
                          desperately)
                   hello...  hello, one. this is
                   daddy...
