     int.  cockpit/"daddy"

     white light from the blast briefly floods the cockpit as todd and 
     riley stare at the video monitor where mekum's video image is
     babbling frantically.

                                   mekum/video image
                    ...i need a report, captain.  it's
                    not just my ass, it's yours too!
                    you've got to stand by me on this.
                    i want you to come in right now...
                    right now!  do you understand me?
                    right now!

     riley turns to todd, looking a question at him.  todd meets his
     look and no words are necessary.

     riley reaches for the control switch as mekum continues babbling.

                                   mekum/video image
                    this is important for all of us, for
                    our careers.  there's going to be a
                    board of inquiry and --

     mekum's image cuts out mid-babble.

                                   slade's voice (o.s.)
                    that was the boss, huh?

     todd and riley turn to see slade in the entrance to the cockpit 
     addressing todd and the veterans collectively.

                                   slade
                    well then, i guess you fellas are
                    all right.  i guess i misjudged you
                    some.  where i said you were "a
                    buncha no good killer robots," i
                    mighta just overspoke myself.  as of
                    now, till it goes otherwise, you got
                    my sincere approval and support.

     with that, slade turns and exits.

     todd looks at riley, riley looks at todd.  what the fuck was
     that?
