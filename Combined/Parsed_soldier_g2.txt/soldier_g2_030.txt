     int.  "station" - day

     separated by fifteen yards, the two groups of soldiers, the new
     and the veteran, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly
     into space as they await orders.  occasionally a veteran will rub
     his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says
     anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away 
     deliberately, expressionless.  nobody flinches when a big door
     opens and pale light streams in.

     mekum is standing there in a poncho.

                                   mekum
                    melton, eight five.  forward.

     melton's face shows no expression as mekum continues.

                                   mekum (o.s.)
                    you've got sixty minutes.  go.

                                   melton
                    sir!

     melton heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as
     we...
