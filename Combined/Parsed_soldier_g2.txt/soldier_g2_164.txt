     as todd completes dressing his thigh, the crawler stops firing.

     silence.

     todd peers out, assessing the situation.

     todd's pov of the terrain.  vague glimpses of new soldiers
     slipping from cover to cover, never exposing themselves enough

     preparing to fight off an attack, laying out weapons, grenades,
     when...he freezes.  listens.

     behind the stillness he can hear the faint whistle that precedes
     the wind.

     hastily todd yanks his belt off.
