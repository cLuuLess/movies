     int.  other room - day - a little later

     todd's heavy boots come close to nathan, the cane clumps down,
     just missing him.

     nathan looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder
     at todd who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help
     of a cane.

     todd looks down at nathan.  their eyes meet for a moment.  todd
     is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear.

     sandra answers a knock at the door, opens it, revealing ellen,
     the ten-year-old, in the doorway.  behind her are johnny and
     will, as well as several other children of various ages.

                                   ellen
                    i came for nathan.

     but ellen's eyes are on todd and so are the others crowding
     behind her to peep over her shoulder.  they all want to get a
     look at todd, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat 
     shyly.

     sandra is wearing a parka too.  she picks up nathan from where
     he's sitting near todd's feet and carries him to the door, giving
     him a kiss, then handing him to ellen.

     nathan starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as
     ellen hugs him and comforts him.

     todd watches the drama as ellen and sandra comfort the child and 
     soothe his fears at being separated from his mother.

     nothing shows in todd's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate
     him.

     as ellen and her cohorts hurry off with nathan, they sneak over-
     the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, todd.

     just then mace, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the 
     bedroom and heads for the door.

                                   mace
                    let's go.  come on, sergeant.

     mace is heading out the door as we...

                                                       cut to:
