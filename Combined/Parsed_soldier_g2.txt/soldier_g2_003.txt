     int.  cage/basement room - day or night

     vicious teeth, savage snarls, tearing flesh as three fierce
     fighting dogs battle a single wolverine in large steel cage.

     the cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded
     by twenty two-year-olds seated on folding chairs and dressed in
     identical gray overalls.  as the two-year-olds watch the battle,
     amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears supered over
     the scene...

                                1994

     we discover in the shadows more anonymous men (and women), some
     of them in military uniforms, observing the children.
