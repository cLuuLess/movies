     int.  "station" - day

     a new soldier fills the frame, a perfect-looking man/boy of about
     twenty built like a linebacker, powerful looking with sculpted
     unscarred musculature.  he looks straight ahead, unblinking, and
     so does the one next to him, and the next one.  twenty of them
     are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was
     once a station of some sort.  they don't seem to respond to the
     chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights
     leaking sixty feet above them.

     wearing dripping ponchos, church, sloan, and rubrick are looking
     the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright-
     eyed blond colonel about thirty, named mekum, stands proudly by,
     glowing with satisfaction.

     the vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of
     stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty
     earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole
     arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and
     a sense of emptiness to it.

     sloan walks close to the line of new soldiers and studies one,
     her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies.  she breaks the
     long silence.

                                   sloan
                    well, they're...pretty.

                                   church
                         (to mekum)
                    what's so hot about them?

                                   mekum
                         (proudly)
                    very much improved.  in every way.

                                   rubrick
                    this is colonel mekum from q.  he's
                    their commanding officer.

                                   church
                         (dubious)
                    improved...how?

                                   mekum
                    as i said, in every way.  physically
                    and psychologically.  more
                    endurance, quicker responses, better
                    hand-eye, improved technical
                    training.  where the first
                    psychology gave you ninety-eight
                    percent obedience, this bunch gives
                    you 99.4.

                                   church
                         (dubiously)
                    mmmmmm.  weeell, you know my old
                    daddy was in maintenance and he had
                    a saying...

     rubrick and sloan exchange an eye-rolling private glance that
     means they've heard a lot of daddy's sayings.

                                   church
                    ...he used to say, "if it ain't
                    broke, don't fix it."

                                   mekum
                         (patronizing)
                    i...see.  i'm not sure i quite get
                    your...point...

                                   church
                         (indicating the
                          veterans)
                    well, the soldiers we've got now,
                    they've been through all kinds of
                    heavy shit...and they've always got
                    the job done.  now these new ones,
                    these "hot shots" of yours...what
                    kind of action have they seen?  they
                    are battle-tested, aren't they?

                                   mekum
                    that's up to you field guys.  h.q.
                    wants you to break 'em in when you
                    do the annual security sweep in
                    january.

                                   church
                    the sweep is just routine, not even
                    police action.  i'd like to see some
                    sort of...meaningful evidence...

                                   mekum
                    such as?

                                   church
                    maybe we could run some tests.  kind
                    of a comparison, the old and the
                    new...

     rubrick and sloan exchange a startled glance, but mekum doesn't
     seem fazed as we...
