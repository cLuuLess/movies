     int.  furnaces/furnace room - night

     a rage of flame!  the mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow
     fury, eight feet high.

     two men, burners, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear,
     laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing.  with
     effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly 
     consumed.  slowly the burners turn and trudge back for another
     load as we reveal a refuse bin, seven feet high, looming in the 
     shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace.  it's 
     overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom.

     the burners grab blindly and haul out the next object.

     it's romero's dead body.  they haul it out of the bin and let it
     flop limply to the floor where romero stares sightlessly at
     nothing.

     the burners stare at the body, exchange a blank look through
     their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward
     the flames.
