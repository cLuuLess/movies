     int.  other damaged corridor

     red scoots around another corner and... stops short...an armored
     torso a foot in front of his face.

     looking up, red looks right into the distorted face of caine 607.

     before red can react, caine 607's hand shoots out and snatches
     one of the axes.

     astonished, red backs up a step, and raises the other axe to
     defend himself.

     red's pov of caine 607 looming toward him, axe in hand.

     angle on red, turning and running.

     angle on caine 607 limping along, dragging his leg as red
     disappears around a corner.

     caine 607 rounds the corner in pursuit... and see only smoke,
     no sign of red.
