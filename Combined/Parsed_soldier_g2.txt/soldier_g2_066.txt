     int.  corridor (and meeting room) - day

     the children are peeking around a doorway, watching something in
     the meeting room.

     hawkins, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the
     children ahead.

                                   hawkins
                    you children are supposed to be
                    doing lessons.

     the children barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them.
     she looks at what they're looking at.

     what they're seeing through the doorway is todd, shirtless, doing
     an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises.  his muscular body
     ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks
     eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of 
     stitches, the puckered patches of burns.

     hawkins watches for a long moment, her eyes worried.

     in the midst of a slow graceful movement, todd suddenly whirls
     and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing
     speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all
     too obvious.

     even as hawkins and the children gasp silently, todd returns to
     the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that 
     preceded the deadly thrust.

     the children's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape.

     hawkins shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud
     to the children.

                                   hawkins
                    lessons.
