     int.  inside the trench

     todd looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench,
     sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench.

     sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, todd tries
     to scale the steep wall of the trench.

     whooooooooosh!  the surface of the water-filled trench bursts
     into flame.  a fiery river of flammable liquid.

     angle on new soldiers reacting to something!

     new soldiers' pov of todd, visible in the firelight as he rolls
     over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them.

     angle on the new soldiers firing as they move toward todd.
     they've got him now!

     angle on todd bellying toward a rusting turbine, disappearing
     from view.

     angle on crawler one, separated from todd's hideout by the 
     trench, pouring heavy fire on the spot where todd disappeared.

     angle on new soldiers communicating by hand signals as they move
     to surround todd.
