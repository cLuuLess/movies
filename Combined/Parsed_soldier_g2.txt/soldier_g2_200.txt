     ext.  inside the garden trench

     sitting up now, using a flashlight, caine 607 is examining a
     terrible gash in his thigh that reveals tissue and tendon.  the
     right side of his face is also badly injured, flesh torn, swollen
     and distorted.

     he pulls the first aid kit from his utility belt, opens it,
     focuses the light on the contents.

     selects a couple of pills.  swallows them.  considers.  takes two 
     more.  pulls out a hypodermic needle, injects his leg.  takes
     another needle, stabs his bloody cheek.

     his eyes glitter as he feels the rush from the drug.  he looks 
     dangerous again in spite of his condition.
