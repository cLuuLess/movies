     ext.  crawler/landscape

     two ominous new soldiers wearing plexi-goggles and bulky armor
     under their uniforms hang on the outside of the crawler in the
     wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big
     rocket rifles across their chests.  they're looking ahead toward
     the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly
     forward through the litter, an evil vision.
