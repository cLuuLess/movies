     ext.  alley/city - night

     frantic civilians, mostly women and children, are illuminated by 
     flashes from rocket fire overhead as they scramble for cover
     amidst heavy crossfire from automatic weapons.

     a terrified little girl, separated from her family, seeks shelter
     in a doorway when suddenly she's confronted by three soldiers in
     red uniforms looming over her.

     looking up in abject horror, she sees a red soldier casually pan
     his assault rifle, pointing the muzzle right at her from only a
     foot away, unmistakably flexing to fire.

     blam!  suddenly the red soldier is blown backwards violently,
     shot in the chest.

     angle on todd, visored, in a torn black uniform, firing again.

     blam!  a second red soldier goes down.

     click!  todd's weapon jams.

     as the little girl, amazed to be alive, watches open mouthed,
     todd swings his weapon like a club, attacking the third red
     soldier before he can aim.

     then she runs, leaving todd savagely beating the third red
     soldier to death.

     todd is delivering a final savage blow to the prone body when a 
     movement or shadow catches the corner of his eye and he whirls 
     savagely to defend himself from behind --
