     int.  bowels of the ship - night - seconds later

     rubrick, church, and sloan are still protesting as the veterans
     hustle them down the ladder toward the main hatch.

                                   rubrick
                    listen, you don't understand!  that
                    bomb is triggered!  it's on a timer!

                                   church
                    we have to get out of here!  all of
                    us!  you need us!  you need us to
                    operate the ship...

                                   sloan
                    you're fucking morons!  can't you
                    dimwits grasp that you're killing us
                    all!  you're killing yourselves!
                    there's only a few minutes left!

                                   rubrick
                    no!  no!  no!

     rubrick is shoved out the door into the night!
