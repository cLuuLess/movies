     ext.  junk mountains/landscape

     as debris from the ship tumbles down onto one of several huge
     mountains of junk that loom 800 hundred feet above a windswept
     terrain dimly lit by four pale suns, the bays close, and the
     rusty garbage ship glides away.

     eating it like acid.

     not far from a smoking piece of steel, we find todd's foot

     in pain as acid hits his exposed foot.  trapped in the debris, 
     battered and bloody and weak, he struggles to rise, fights the
     heavy objects pinning him, fights to avoid the dripping acid.  as
     the wind screams furiously, he continues to struggle against the
