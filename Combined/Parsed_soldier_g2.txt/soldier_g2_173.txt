     int.  crawler one

     the gunner is peering intently through his scope.

     gunner's pov through his scope: the infrared view with crosshairs
     is especially spooky because of the debris blowing eerily across
     the landscape as the gun whips back and forth, looking vainly for 
     todd.  suddenly the sight is yanked hard, sweeping violently
     over to pin a moving object...

     false alarm!  just another piece of blowing junk.  no sign of
     todd.
