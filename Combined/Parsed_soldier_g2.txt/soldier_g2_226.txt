     ext.  spaceship/"daddy"

     blast off!  big engines belch fire, illuminating the bleak
     landscape as the ship rises into the night.

     brightly lit by the ignition, sloan, still on her belly, sees the
     ship taking off.

                                   sloan
                    oh, my god!  oh, my god!

                                   church
                    there it is!  i see it!

     the bomb is clearly visible ten yards away in the dying glow of
     the takeoff.

     church bumps madly along the ground on his belly.
