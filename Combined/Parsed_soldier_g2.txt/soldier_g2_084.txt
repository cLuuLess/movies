     int.  bedroom - night

     mace and sandra are lying awake in the bed in darkness.  for a
     long moment they're both silent with the silence that comes in a
     heavy moment in a conversation.  then mace speaks, his eyes on
     the ceiling.

                                   mace
                   there's going to be a meeting.
                   people are upset about him.

                                   sandra
                   he's not fully recovered.

                                   mace
                   that's what scares people.  he gets
                   stronger every day.

     they're both silent for a long moment.  mace has something
     weighing on his mind that he hesitates to say...but finally he
     says it.

                                   mace
                   i've caught him..sneaking looks at
                   you.  at your body.

                                   sandra
                   i know.

     a heavy silence, then...

                                   sandra
                   are you afraid of him, mace?

     mace stares at the ceiling and speaks with difficult honesty.

                                   mace
                   yes.
                         (pauses, then)
                   god knows where he's been...or what
                   he's done.

     another pause before...

                                   mace
                   i've never been afraid of anyone
                   before...not this way.  i feel he
                   could break me in half...with no
                   real effort and no real...feeling.

                                   sandra
                   he told me he's afraid.

                                   mace
                   maybe he is.  it doesn't matter.

     mace is staring grimly at the ceiling as we...

                                                       cut to:
