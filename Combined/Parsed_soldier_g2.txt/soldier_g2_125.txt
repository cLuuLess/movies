     church and sloan look up from their card game again as rubrick
     sticks his head in the door to report the latest.

                                   rubrick
                   report from crawler one.  everything
                   under control.  no need for
                   assistance.

                                   church
                   there's resistance?

                                   rubrick
                   ineffectual.  about fifty
                   disorganized people with almost no
                   fire power.  three men are going in
                   to clean them out; one man's staying
                   with the crawler.

                                   church
                   humph.  sounds reckless, three
                   against fifty.  the old ones, the
                   veterans, they would have called for
                   support...just in case.

     again rubrick and sloan exchange a glance and an eye-roll at the 
     fretting old fuddy-duddy.  then sloan changes the subject
     brightly.

                                   sloan
                   speaking of riley and his old
                   soldiers...why don't we let them
                   start putting up the unit?  it's
                   gonna take forever in this wind.
