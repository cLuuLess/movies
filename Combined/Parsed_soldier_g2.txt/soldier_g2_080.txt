     the scarf!  it's been knitted with an elaborate and colorful
     design.

                                   jimmy pig's wife (o.s.)
                   jimmy knitted it himself.  he worked
                   on it for two months.

     sandra is examining the knitted scarf as jimmy pig and his wife
     stand in the doorway.

                                   sandra
                   it's beautiful, jimmy.  he'll love
                   it.

     jimmy pig looks very embarrassed.  he shrugs.

                                   jimmy pig
                   he saved my life out there.  i guess
                   mace told you.

                                   sandra
                         (nods)
                   you should give it to him yourself.
                   i think he's in the meeting room...
                   doing...exercises.

     jimmy pig nods, takes the knitted scarf back from sandra as we...
