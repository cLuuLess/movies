     ext.  barracks - day

     rain.  low buildings, boarded windows, slogans painted on the war-
     scarred walls, the makeshift barracks in one building, command
     quarters in the next.

     a lone figure, a man in a poncho, hurries through the downpour,
     passing the barracks, heading for the command quarters.
