     int.  other room

     nathan is wobbling forward with wide eyes as mace holds one of
     his hands and sandra holds the other.  they're teaching the child
     to walk, encouraging each step.  but when they let go, nathan
     totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass.
     mace and sandra laugh, making the whole thing a game, and nathan, 
     after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter.  it's a warm 
     moment until sandra, sensing a presence, turns toward the
     bedroom, suddenly serious.

     mace follows her look.

     todd is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door
     frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg
     heavily bandaged.

                                   sandra
                         (nervous)
                    you must be...you must be feeling
                    better.

     todd says nothing.  his eyes flick to nathan.

     mace is watching todd sharply.

                                   mace
                    we're teaching the boy to walk.

                                   sandra
                         (nervously filling silence)
                    he's late learning.  he was sick for
                    a long time.

     todd says nothing.  his eyes follow mace who's gone to the corner
     where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon.

     todd tenses.  ready.  dangerous.

     as mace turns toward him, mace doesn't notice the danger in
     todd's eyes.

                                   mace
                    i got something for you.

     he innocently approaches with the metal rod.

     super alert, todd watches mace hold the rod out to him.

                                   mace
                    here.

     todd looks mistrustful.

                                   mace
                    like this.

     mace demonstrates, using the rod like a cane.
                                   mace
                    see?

     expressionless, watches mace use the cane.

                                   mace
                    practice with it.  in a day or two
                    maybe you'll be strong enough to go
                    out to the garden with sandra.

     mace never even realizes how much danger he was in.
