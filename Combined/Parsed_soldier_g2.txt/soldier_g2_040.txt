     int.  refuse bin/furnace room

     burners' hands reach in and haul out another corpse, goines,
     dragging the body right over todd's body.

     as goines' shoe drags over todd's face, todd's eyes flicker
     stupidly.

     then goines' corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin.

     todd blinks, fighting for consciousness.  where is he?  he moves
     his head...
