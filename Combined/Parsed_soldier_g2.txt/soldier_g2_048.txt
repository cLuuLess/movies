     ext.  landscape and "junk mountain" - dusk

     tiny in the distance, the four figures are moving together along
     a cable, headed away from the junk mountain.

     at ground level now, todd is watching them, crouched behind a
     massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of
     its great bulk.

     peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the
     taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of
     "his" mountain.  the cable is twenty yards away in a "canyon" of
     junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed
     to the wind in order to get to it.

     he starts out from behind the transformer...

     whoooooo!  screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet,
     his arms flailing.  he comes down even further from the cable, 
     struggling to keep on his feet.  gritting his teeth, he fights
     the wind, struggles toward the cable.

     suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time
     as it whistles close to his head.

     todd drops to the ground and starts to crawl "under the wind,"
     toward the taut cable, and we...
