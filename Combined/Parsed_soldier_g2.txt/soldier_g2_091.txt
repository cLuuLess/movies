     int.  crawler

     the husky sergeant, caine 607, steers the vehicle and speaks into
     a radio mike at the same time.

                                   caine 607
                   crawler, crawler to daddy.  no
                   hostiles!

     the gunner beside him and the new soldiers in the back seat stare
     stoically out the windows as caine 607 replaces the mike.
