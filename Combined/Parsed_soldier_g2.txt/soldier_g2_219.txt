     darkness!  buffeted by the wind, riley and his companions lower
     the bomb to the ground and release it gently.  they're just
     turning to go back, fighting the wind, when riley senses
     something.  he takes the light from green and points it.

     the four veterans axe astonished at what they see.

     crawler one, battered and motionless, is abandoned only ten yards 
     away.

     the flashlight beam probes the blown out windshield, the scarred 
     chassis, pans across the back seat...and pans back urgently,

     for dear life.  he's wearing the scarf jimmy pig gave him.

     more children are watching anxiously.

     riley's stone face comes as close to expression as it ever

     the other veterans stare too, amazed.

     suddenly riley gives todd a smart military salute.

     angle on jimmy pig and slade exchanging a look of wonder.  what's 
     going on here?  they haven't a clue!  and we...
