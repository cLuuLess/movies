     int.  room

     todd's impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness
     he feels at what's happening to him.  tommy is seated on his 
     shoulders, he's got nathan in one arm and johnny is nervously
     looking up at him as he clutches at todd's huge free hand, and
     now a little girl, sarah, clutches at his combat pants as sandra 
     instructs her.

                                   sandra
                   sarah, you hang on to sergeant todd.
                   no matter what happens!

     clutching todd's combat pants fiercely, sarah looks up timidly at
     the big stonefaced man as sandra turns to ellen.

                                   sandra
                   ellen, go to the commons.  tell
                   jimmy pig and mr. slade that
                   sergeant todd says we have to leave
                   as soon as they get everybody out of
                   the root-cellar.  can you do that?

                                   ellen
                         (scared)
                   uh, yes, ma'am.

                                   sandra
                   it's all right.  the soldiers are
                   gone for now.  but be careful where
                   you walk.  and if it's too smoky,
                   just come back.

                                   sarah
                         (on her way out)
                   yes, ma'am.

                                   sandra
                         (calling after her)
                   tell them to bring all the food and
                   clothing they can carry.
                         (turning to the
                          children)
                   do you all understand that sergeant
                   todd here is going to help us, and
                   whatever he says to do you must do
                   immediately, as if he was your
                   father or your mother.

                                   sarah
                         (tears)
                   he's not my father!

     angle on todd's stone face.  unfamiliar territory.

                                   sandra
                   no... but he's our friend.  our good
                   friend.  do you understand?

     frightened faces look to the awkward "killing machine."

     todd looks like a statue decorated with children.

     johnny is sobbing as he hangs onto todd's giant hand obediently.
                                   johnny
                   i want my father and my mother!  can
                   he find where my father is?  i want
                   him to find my father!

                                   sandra
                   no.  no, he can't do that, but --

     a scream!  from the corridor!

     sandra freezes.  todd is alert, tense...and covered with
     children.

     sandra turns and runs for the door as todd starts to put the
     children down.  but he's awkward, slow, not his usual graceful
     self, trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables.
