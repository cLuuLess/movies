     todd, riley, and the third soldier converge stealthily,
     coordinating with hand signals.

     todd pulls the pin on a grenade, and riley and the third soldier
     kick in the door.

     todd tosses the grenade in as riley fires a withering barrage of
     automatic fire through the cellar door.

     bahwhoom!  the grenade explodes.

     then, riley, todd and the third soldier charge in.
