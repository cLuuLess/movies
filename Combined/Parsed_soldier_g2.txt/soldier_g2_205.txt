     carrying two axes red zips around a corner and freezes...

     red's pov of: a soldier, seen from behind, moving down a smoky
     corridor, helmeted, heavily armed, dangerous looking,
     unidentifiable.

     angle on red, terrified, waiting till the soldier (todd) has
     disappeared in the smoke.  then red hurries on down another
     damaged corridor, axes in hand.
