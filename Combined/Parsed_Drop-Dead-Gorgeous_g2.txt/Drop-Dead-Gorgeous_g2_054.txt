		...oh you betcha!  we're happier than 
		the day hanky got acquitted.  i get 
		made a judge, then the furniture store 
		hires us to paint the whole damn 
		thing.
			(removing cap)
		we're gonna use the money to get our 
		mamma a proper headstone.  oh, and 
		move her out to the cemetery.

	suddenly, hank runs full speed into the window.  bam!  he 
	falls to the ground inside.
