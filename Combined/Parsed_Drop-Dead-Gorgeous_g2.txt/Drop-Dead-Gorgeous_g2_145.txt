	colleen and terry smoke and drink at a tall tiki table 
	that's covered with empties.  in the b.g., a pageant 
	worker passes out pink bags to the contestants.  all the 
	while, two fat kids play "marco polo" in the pool.

		i can sum up our entire philosophy 
		with this glass.  i look at it and 
		say, "it's half full."  which, in the 
		beauty pageant biz means, "where the 
		hell's my waiter!"

	she laughs hard, then spins around in her chair.

			(screaming)
		stop with the fuckin' marco-polo 
		before i rip your fat little heads 
		off!
