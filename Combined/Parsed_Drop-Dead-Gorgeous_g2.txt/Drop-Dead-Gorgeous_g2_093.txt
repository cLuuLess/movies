	ext. loretta's trailer - porch - that night

	a very shaken amber paces.

				amber
		don't you get it?  i was supposed to 
		go first.  i was contestant number 
		one.  that light was meant for my 
		head.  if janelle hadn't wanted to 
		change numbers... god, i owe my life 
		to that deaf baby.

	loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand.

				loretta
		that was your mom.  she wanted you to 
		have this.

				amber
			(taking drink)
		really, loretta?

				loretta
			(avoiding eye contact)
		you-betcha.

				amber
		my mom wanted me to have this?

				loretta
		oh, shut up.  i thought it might help 
		you get some sleep.

				amber
		loretta, never have kids.

				loretta
		well god-love-ya for thinkin' i still 
		could.

	loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to 
	amber.

				loretta (cont'd)
		here, your ma did want you to have 
		this since your other one got toasted 
		and all.

	amber pulls out an elegant green gown.

				amber
		oh...my...god!  it's just like diane 
		sawyer's!  kcourse it's not a size 
		ten, diane was a little hippy back 
		then.  oh, thank you!  thank you!
