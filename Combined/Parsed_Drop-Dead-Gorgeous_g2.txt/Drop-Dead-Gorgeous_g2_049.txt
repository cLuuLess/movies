		"impartial?"  outside this house i'm 
		gladys leeman, president, civil 
		servettes - impartial as the day is 
		long.  but we're inside my home now 
		and i've gotta warn you, i'm wearin' 
		my "wife apron" and "mom hat."  so, i 
		can safely say that i'm the mother of 
		the most talented contestant mount 
		rose has ever seen.
