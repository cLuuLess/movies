	int. high school - gym - later

	michelle johanson is on stage, sitting on a stool, 
	wearing all black.  she smiles warmly.  then, with one 
	sweep of her hand across her face, her smile drops.  
	she's dead serious.

		fade in...earth.  the year is two-
		thousand twenty-four.  the question on 
		everyone's mind:  what is...soylent 
		green?

	she sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in 
	character," pained, near death, and overly dramatic.

	backstage - left - continuous

	amber, now in the leotard, talks to iris.  michelle 
	performs from "soylent green" in the b.g.

		mrs. clark, why are you doing this to 
		me?  why're you pretendin' you don't 
		know what's goin' on?

				iris
		amber, i'm sorry.  i really am.  but 
		you know the rules.  all talent 
		costumes hafta be okay'd by gladys 
		before the pageant.

				amber
		but, doesn't someone taking your 
		costume so you can't compete, overrule 
		that rule?

				iris
		sorry.  i-i don't make the rules.

				amber
		this, this... this is bullshit!

				iris
		amber atkins!  that is not american 
		teen princess language!

				amber
		good, kcause this isn't an american 
		teen princess pageant - it's, it's 
		nazi germany!

	amber storms off.

				iris
			(shaking head)
		where do they get this stuff...
