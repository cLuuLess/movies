	on stage "through the eyes of love" plays as janelle 
	performs her interpretative dance while signing the 
	words.  in the f.g., gladys appears very serious.

		i'll be honest.  this is a hard time 
		for me.  this is the part of the 
		pageant when you realize that tomorrow 
		night, all but one of these girls will 
		walk out of here a loser.  it's hard 
		for me to know how that must feel, but 
		i'm sure it doesn't feel good.

	in b.g., a big stage light falls on janelle's head.  
	crash!  gladys and camera rush the stage.  "through the 
	eyes of love" continues throughout.
