	int. larson funeral home - hallway - night

	a small sign on the door reads: "embalming - please 
	knock!"

	push into room.  amber, back to us, frantically applies 
	blusher to an old woman.  another body, covered with a 
	white sheet, is on the embalming slab.  the top and brim 
	of a hunting cap can be seen.  she turns around to see 
	the crew.

			(surprised)
		ahhh!  je-sus-christ-on-a-cross!
			(catching breath)
		look, number one rule in a funeral 
		home - never sneak up on the livin'.  
		you never know who could have an 
		embalming needle or skull saw in their 
		hand.  mr. larson's son learned that 
		the hard way - he's buried next to my 
		grandpa!

	amber turns to the slab to continue working.  she pulls 
	off the sheet to reveal brett, handsome football player, 
	still wearing his hunting plaid.
