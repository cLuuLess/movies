	int. high school - class room - night

	judges stare nervously at the camera - clip boards in 
	front of them.  hank's loud breathing from the paint 
	soaked bag is obviously getting on john's nerves.

				documentarian (o.s.)
		so who get's the crown?  how are you 
		going to figure this all out?

				john
		uh, we're gonna, y'know, compare 
		scores and uh, figure out a-a winner.  
		kcause we don't know the winner yet... 
		i mean, i-i don't know who jean and 
		harold picked.  no idea.  did gladys 
		send you in here?

				hank
		i know the winner!  i know the winner!  
		i know the winner!

				john
		no you don't!  shut your goddamn 
		mouth, you son-of-a-bitch!!

	nerves shot, john suddenly launches himself across the 
	table at hank.

				harold
		wait a second.

				john
		you shut it!  you goddamn retard!

	hank freezes, then starts to wail!

				hank
		ee-aaayeeee-aaaayouiaaaeeeeeeee!

				harold
		come on!  hankey here can't help it if 
		he was born crazier than a shithouse 
		rat!

	hank stops crying and goes back to the bag.

				john
		for fuck's sake, why didn't ya leave 
		him with a sitter?

	hank begins crying again.

				harold
		real nice.  you know the sitter's 
		dead.

								dissolve to:

	backstage - dressing room

	girls, in gowns, sit in silence.  becky and amber sit at 
	opposite ends of the room.  there's obvious tension.

				leslie
		so, anyone talk to janelle?

				amber
		yah-i brought her some flowers this 
		morning.  she's in the room next to my 
		mom.  she's super happy.

	girls ad-lib shock.

				tess
		she's happy?

				leslie
		why happy?

				amber (cont'd)
		oh -- the blow to her head made her 
		deaf...

	girls ad-lib "oh, i see.  okay-then." etc.  another long 
	beat of silence follows.  becky gets up to re-touch her 
	make-up.

				becky
			(losing it)
		oh, good lord!  what're they doin'?  
		lettin' the retard count votes?!

	contestants stare at her in shock.  iris enters.

				iris
		it's time, ladies.
