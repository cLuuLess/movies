		dad's thresher - she said the heavy 
		vibration helped her think, y'know?  
		but i know for a fact she only smoked 
		after a good drive.  you ask me or 
		anyone else who isn't scared to talk 
		about it - tammy was murdered.

		deal with crap like this...

		bullet to the head.

	she adjusts brett's red plaid hunting cap.

				amber (cont'd)

				mr. larson
