		yeah, you bet i do.  i mean, maybe 
		other people think i can't win a 
		beauty pageant.  but other people 
		didn't think i could beat out becky 
		leeman for president of the gun club, 
		either.  and i did.  i-i-it's just 
		like anthony robbins says, "i'm a 
		winner.  nobody can stop me but me!"
