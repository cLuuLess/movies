	ext. graveyard - day

	lovely hillside.  a pastor and town folk - heads bowed - 
	stand beside a fresh grave.

		that's why, dear lord, it's with such 
		great sorrow that we turn over to you 
		a young woman whose dream of ridin' on 
		a giant swan brought about her 
		untimely death.  maybe it's your way 
		of telling us to buy american.
