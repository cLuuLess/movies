	on molly howard

	wearing an atomic blast at hiroshima headdress.

		atomic power makes me, molly howard, 
		proud to be an asian-american.

	as she steps away from the mic, tess weinhaus, wearing a 
	huge ball of twine headdress, dances up to the mic.

				tess
		uh, this, uh, my uncle phil's world's 
		largest ball of twine, in bundy 
		minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me 
		proud i'm american - i kinda 
		misunderstood the assignment.

	the ball of twine falls to the floor and rolls off the 
	stage, still attached at one end to her head.

	backstage - dressing room

	pandemonium!  contestants change into their "physical 
	fitness" outfits.  (t-shirts with red flags, shorts) 
	civil servettes try to help.  a large picture of janelle 
	betz sits at her counter space.

	becky freezes, staring daggers at amber.

				becky

	the other contestants slowly clear a path between them.

				becky

				becky

	brewin'.

		snotty attitude, becky - bring it on.
