	int. betz living room - night

	mrs. betz, a large woman, holds a tray of bars.  crew 
	members reach in the shot and help themselves.  janelle 
	betz sits on the couch, signing everything she says.

				janelle
			(slow, due to signing)
		...my talent will be an interpretive 
		dance while i sing, "through the eyes 
		of love."  i have a dream of spreadin' 
		sign language around the world... mom?  
		would you be so kind?

	super: contestant #8, janelle betz

				janelle (cont'd)
		yeah.  well, see, uh, i have a dream 
		of spreading sign language around the 
		world.
			(to mrs. betz)
		mom, would you be so kind.

	mrs. betz quickly puts down the bars and goes to the 
	piano where she starts "through the eyes of love."  
	janelle begins to gesticulate and sign words in an overly 
	dramatic performance that looks like a bizarre seizure.  
	sound occasionally dips out as the boom operator reaches 
	for bars.
