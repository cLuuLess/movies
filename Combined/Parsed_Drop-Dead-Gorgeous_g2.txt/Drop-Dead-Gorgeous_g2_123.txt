	ext. mount rose street - back to documentary camera

	pan over to see gladys helping becky climb on the swan, 
	unaware of camera.  in b.g., documentary crew interviews 
	amber and leslie on their convertible behind the swan 
	float.

		c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it.  now 
		get up there.  ride it side-saddle if 
		you have to - like a horse.  c'mon, 
		now.

				becky
		it smells funny.  like gasoline.

				gladys
		oh for chrissakes, everything smells 
		like that in mexico.

				becky
		my dress'll reek.

				gladys
		listen, little missy, this cost your 
		dad a pretty penny.  now get your ass 
		up there and show me some teeth.
