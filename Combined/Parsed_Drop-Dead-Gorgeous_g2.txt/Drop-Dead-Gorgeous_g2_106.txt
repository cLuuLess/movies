	int. backstage

	camera follows amber as she storms over to backstage - 
	right where gladys watches michelle on stage.

				amber
		mrs. leeman?

				gladys
			(turning)
		huh?

				amber
		i-i'm wearin' this costume.  i'm, uh, 
		i'm gonna do my talent tonight.

				gladys
		oh really - i don't think so.
			(suddenly aware of camera)
		uh, amber, i hate to be the bearer of 
		bad news, but rules state that a 
		costume must be okay'd at least a week 
		in advance.  and this...
			(pointing to costume)
		this is why we have the rule.  my 
		goodness gracious, i couldn't allow a 
		neckline this low on stage.  we have 
		kids in the audience.

				amber
		but, you - i mean... it's not my 
		fault.  i-i... please?  i didn't do 
		anything wrong...

	amber starts to cry.

				michelle
			(climaxing)
		that's why... i must say...
			(raising arm upward)
		soylent green... is... people.

	she doubles over.  she's given it all.  applause.

				gladys
		oops, that's my cue.

	gladys starts out on stage as molly howard, dressed like 
	a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to amber.  
	she's twirling toy guns on her fingers.

				molly
		wish me luck.

				amber
			(drying her eyes)
		good luck, molly.

	one of molly's guns flies off her finger.  she goes to 
	retrieve it.
