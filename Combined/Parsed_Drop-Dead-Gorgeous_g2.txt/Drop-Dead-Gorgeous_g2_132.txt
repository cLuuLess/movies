	ext. loretta's trailer - day

	amber sits on the picnic table.  in the b.g., loretta 
	exits her trailer with a fed-ex guy.  she pats his buns 
	as he exits.  she approaches amber with a packet.

				amber (v.o.)
		i never liked her, but she didn't 
		deserve to die in the belly of a swan 
		like that.  the whole thing's just 
		kinda sad and lame at the same time.

				loretta
			(handing over packet)
		this came for you, sweetie.

				amber
		ah!  it's from state!  oh my god!

	amber rips it open and holds up a color brochure with 
	colleen and terry in a glamour shot on the cover.

				amber (cont'd)
			(paging through packet)
		it's all the stuff i get to do.  oh my 
		god, oh my god... okay, okay... we get 
		a "personal consultation" with a make-
		up artist -- eeeh!  okay, um, there'll 
		be a choreographer to the stars and, 
		oh no -- no way.  oh... my... god!

				loretta
		what?  for chrissakes, spit it out.

				amber
		i'll be stayin' overnight at... the 
		airport howard johnsons!

				loretta
		right by the airport - oh, amber...

				amber
		there's an indoor swimming pool!  
		ahhhh!

	loretta joins in the screaming.

				amber (cont'd)
		oh crap - i only got four days.  i 
		gotta practice!
