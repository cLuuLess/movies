		yah-so how kbout a big round of 
		applause for last year's mount rose 
		american teen princess, in a farewell 
		performance.  who could forget her lip-
		synching to "don't cry out loud," by 
		melissa manchester.  and here she is, 
		mary johanson!

	applause!  gladys exits.  taped music "it's my turn."  a 
	nurse pushes mary johanson out in her wheelchair, 
	complete with portable oxygen.  mary wears a gigantic 
	black wig and silver gown which hangs off her boney body.  
	she moves her lips to the words as the nurse pushes her 
	emotionally around the stage.
