     ext. crash ship - day

     chain looped over one shoulder, fry heads back to the grave site.
     johns, imam, shazza, and audrey keep pace as...

                              johns
               i know what happened -- he went off on the
               guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
               now he's trying to --

                              fry
               let's just be sure.

                              johns
               i am sure. look, murders aside, riddick
               belongs in the asshole hall of fame. he
               loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
               afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. and
               you're playing right into --

                              fry
               we're gonna find the body, johns. christ,
               you're a cop. why am i tellin' you this?
               we gotta go down and find it.

                              johns
               well, don't ask me to.

                              fry
               thought you didn't believe his story.

                              johns
               i don't. but that ground looked none too
               stable, and i don't want anyone --

                              audrey
               if you're afraid, i'll go.

     he shoots audrey a scowl.

                              fry
               nobody else is going down but me, okay?

                              johns
                         (pulling her aside)
               hey. bein' ballsy with your life now
               doesn't change what came before -- it's
               just stupid.

                              fry
               what, you think i'm doin' this to prove
               something?

                              johns
               you said it, not me. let's just not let
               one bad call lead to another.

                              fry
               thanks for the tip, johns.

     "now get outta my way."
