               you know, i woulda played road dog for
               these guys. you could've stayed back.
               pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
               if we don't find water....

     "we may not make it back."

                              fry (o.s.)
               no, no, i wanted to get away.

                              johns (o.s.)
               so i noticed. never seen a "captain"
               quite so ready to leave her ship.

     just as riddick eases his blade toward fry's neck...
