     ext. crash ship - deep dusk

               jesus, how many can there....

     they keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. mercifully,
     the hatchlings seem to be moving away. but now one wave cleaves
     from another -- and does a quick about-face.

                              paris
               just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
               flee.

                              fry
               cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
               lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

     they run. reach the cargo hold. turn back to see...

     riddick and shazza still coming. hearing the squealing wave
     descending on them...

     riddick and shazza hit to the dirt. hatchlings torrent just
     inches overhead.

     close on shazza. horrified. hard to breathe. like being
     underwater.

     close on riddick. he watches in awe, no more frightened that a
     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. experimenting, he
     eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. instantly it's whittled
     down to nothing. it's like a river of razor blades.

     the hatchling keep coming. shazza whips a panicky look at the
     cargo hold. can she make it? should she even try?

                              audrey
               tell her to stay there. stay down.
               shazza, just stay down!

     shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. suddenly the
     hatchings vanish. a beat. is it safe? shazza gets to her
     feet...

                              fry
               no, no, no, no, no....

     ...and the wave is back, enveloping shazza.
