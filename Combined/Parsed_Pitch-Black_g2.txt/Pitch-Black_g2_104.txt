                              imam
               ...and for this, our gift of drink, we
               give thanks in the name of our prophet,
               muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
               lord, jesus christ of nazareth, and to his
               father, allah the compassionate and the
               merciful.

                         (to himself)
               the strangest religion....

     pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. riddick gets
     the last of it -- the part with sediment. selected closeups as
     they drink. nothing ever tasted finer.

                              paris
               perhaps we should toast our hosts. who
               were these people, anyway? miners?

                              shazza
               looks like geologists. advance team,
               moves around from rock to rock.

                              johns
               musta crapped out here, huh?

                              audrey
               but why did they leave their ship?

     silence. it's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
     imam notices one water glass unspoken for.
