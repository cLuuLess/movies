     int. nav-bay - main cabin

     they stumble into nav-bay. alarms continue. fry grabs warm-up
     suits out of storage, pitches one to owens, checks her screens.

                              fry
               1550 millibars, dropping 20 mb per minute,
               shit, we're hemorrhaging air. somethin'
               took a swipe at us.

                              owens
               just tell me we're still in the shipping
               lane. just show me all those stars, all
               those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

     owens activates an exterior view: a planet rushes up at us.
     that's why they have gravity.

                              fry
               jesus god....
