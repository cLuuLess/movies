     int. main cabin - crash ship - day

     riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
     to sotto voce voices outside. fry enters, looks at him hard.

                              fry
               so where is he?

     riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. the eye
     beneath is closed: for some reason, he won't look at her.

                              fry
               tell me about the sounds. you told them
               you heard something right before....
                         (no response)
               if you don't talk to me, johns'll take
               another crack at it -- at your skull.

                              riddick
               'mean the whispers?

                              fry
               what whispers?

                              riddick
               the ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
               spot -- just to the left of the spine,
               fourth lumbar down. the abdominal aorta.
               what a gusher. had a cup on his belt,
               so i used it to catch a little run-off.
               metallic taste to it, human blood.
               coppery. but if you cut it with
               peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
               course, that's more for winter.
               summertime, i take mine straight.

     fry stares. riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
     boogeyman: if fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
     riddick is going to grab some with both hands.

                              fry
               why don't we try the truth now?

     a head-shaking beat, then:

                              riddick
               all you people are so scared of me --
               an' most days, i'd take that as a
               compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
               worry about now.

                              fry
               show me your eyes.

     again he turns away. she strips the goggles off. he sits with
     lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.

                              fry
               show me, riddick.

     imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
     time. that's how riddick opens his eyes, startling us: no
     irises, just huge black-pool pupils. and from deep within, a
     jewel-like eyeshine. his eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
     those of a starved jaguar.

                              fry
               you did this? to yourself?

                              riddick
               slam doctor. well, we called him "doctor."

                              fry
               heard about it. just never seen it.

                              riddick
               fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
               slamlight's so dim that you go and get
               your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
               then you wind up here. three ass-kick
               suns.
                         (replacing goggles)
               maybe i did do a few people. but not this
               one. no ma'am, not this time.

                              fry
               then where is he? he's not in the hole.
               we looked.

                              riddick
               look deeper.

     he clicks his tongue at her.
