     ext. settlement - day

     high angle: an old weather cock creaks in the wind. fry,
     johns, and the chrislams enter frame far below.

                              pilgrim #1
               assalamoo ahlaykum!

     the greeting echoes through the settlement, built from stacked
     shipping containers. tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. a
     rusty bike lies on the ground.

                              pilgrim #2
               assalamoo ahlaykum!

                              johns
               long gone. whoever they were.

     they move around a building -- and pull up short. before them
     looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
     old jugs litter the ground.

                              imam
               water...water there was here....

                              pilgrims
               allahu akbar....


                              imam
                         (translating)
               "god is great," yes?

                              johns
               i'm born-again.

     fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
     abandoned buildings. "who were these people? why did they
     leave so much behind?"
