     ext. settlement - day

     fry and johns move outside. the others have gathered, all eyes
     gang-locked on...

     an arch in the sky. luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.

                              paris
               what do my eyes see?

                              fry
               it's starting....

     they watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
     suns. shazza shakes out of the trance first.

                              shazza
                         (to fry)
               if we need anything from the crash ship --
               i suggest we kick on. that sand-cat's
               solar.
