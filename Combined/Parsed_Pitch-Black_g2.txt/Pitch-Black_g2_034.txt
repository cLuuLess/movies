     int. main cabin - crash ship - day

     breaking out pressure suits:

                              fry
               liquid oxygen canisters inside. start
               ripping them out. quick hits only -- try
               to make it last.

                              audrey
               well, is someone coming for us? or are
               we all just gonna die of exposure or
               dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
               something worse?
                         (off their looks)
               hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
               me.

                              shazza
               we're worried you'll scare us.
                         (ushering her away)
               name's "audrey," right, love? and you're
               goin' to taurus three like we were?

                              audrey
               yeah, but...do we even have enough food
               to get there? or will we have to resort
               to cannibalism?

                              zeke
                         (to fry)
               i'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
               further, cap'n. with your permission,
               a' course.

     fry blinks. "they actually think i'm the captain." zeke and the
     others get to work. fry finds herself staring at another
     problem. riddick.

                              fry
               and him?

                              johns
               big evil?

                              fry
               we just keep him locked up forever?

                              johns
               be my choice. already escaped once from
               the max-slam facility on --

                              fry
               i don't need his life story. is he really
               that dangerous?

                              johns
               only around humans.

     riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
     fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.

                              fry
               oh, christ....

     they're losing water. suddenly fry is running, snatching up an
     emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...
