     ...and birth her into daylight. overlapping:

                              johns
               we got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
               you now....

                              imam
               the child heard you before any of us could
               even....

                              shazza
               did you find him? you find zeke?

                              fry
                         (half insane)
               ...wasn't riddick...it was...it was...
               goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
               riddick. somethin' else down there that
               got zeke and nearly got --

     her. she flies back into the spire. something's still got the
     chain.

     the others grab at flailing limbs. it's a tug-of-war now, human
     hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
     are losing. until...

     imam unsheathes his blade...

     and slices through fry's belt.
