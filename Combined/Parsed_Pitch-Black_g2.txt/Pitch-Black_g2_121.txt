     ext. skiff - day

     close on the knife slicing through the vectran.

     riddick hands the trim to pilgrim #1. camera follows as he
     scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
     delivers the piece to imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
     berber rug-weaver. pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...

     the setting blue sun. nothing unusual. yet.
