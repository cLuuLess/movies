     int. flight deck - crash ship - day

     darkness. a light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
     it's packed with dirt, no signs of life. about to search
     elsewhere, johns turns back at...

                              fry (o.s.)
               hey.

                              johns
               hey, who?

                              fry (o.s.)
               hey, me. over here.

     his light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. johns
     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her. fry. buried to the gills.

                              johns
               amazing. i'm johns.

                              fry
               carolyn fry. i'd shake hands, but...

     he manages a smile and starts digging her out. almost dreading
     to ask:

                              fry
               are there any others, johns?
