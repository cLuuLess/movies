     ext. the gauntlet - night

     slew of shots: fry and imam on the move, dragging the shield
     fast. audrey speed-crawling beneath. pilgrim #1 tripping along
     behind the shield. and riddick behind them all, face already
     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
     somehow keeping pace. the torch flames, stretched by the wind,
     flank them in fire.
