     int. flight deck - day

     fry flips up a new security-latch. intercutting:

                              owens
               fry?

                              fry
               can't get my nose down...too much load
               back there....

                              owens
               you mean that "load" of passengers?

                              fry
               so what, we should both go down too?
               out of sheer fucking nobility?

     tortured silence. fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
     jettison the passenger cabin. jettison 50 people.
