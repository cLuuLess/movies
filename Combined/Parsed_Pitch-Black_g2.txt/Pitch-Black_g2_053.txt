               better keep moving....

                              johns
               what'd owens mean? 'bout not touching
               the switch?

     fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
     again she leans back on the combing. we can actually see riddick
     now. they could too, if they would just turn the fuck around!

                              johns (cont'd)

               promise me. swear to me you won't --

               you and me.

                              fry
               during the landing...when things were
               at their worst...owens was at his best.
               he's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
               dump the passenger cabin.

     johns blinks, stunned. "are you shittin' me?"
