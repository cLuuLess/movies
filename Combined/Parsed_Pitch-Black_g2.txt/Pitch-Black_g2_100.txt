     ext. moisture-recovery unit - settlement - day

     close on the other chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
     while awaiting...

     the first drop of water. it appears at the bottom of a pipette.

     tongues fight for it. another drop forms in its place. now
     another and another. it brings cheers.
