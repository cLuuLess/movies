     int. sixth container - cargo hold - night

     cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. the survivors
     gather around fry's handlight. audrey -- tough little audrey --
     has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.

                              fry
               ...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
               two more in the cabin...i think two
               more....

                              paris
               spirits. anything over 45 proof burns
               well.

                              fry
               how many bottles?

                              paris
               not sure. ten?

                              fry
               those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
               would they burn?
                         (reading his face)
               if you got a receipt?

                              paris
               possibly.

                              fry
               awright. so maybe we'll have enough light.

                              johns
               enough for what?

     now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.

                              johns (cont'd)
               oh, lady. if you're in your right mind,
               i pray you go insane.

                              fry
                         (to others)
               we can stick to the plan. if we get four
               cells back to the skiff, we're off this
               rock.

                              paris
               i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
               ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
               night.

                              fry
               we'll have to carry the cells...drag
               them...whatever it takes.

     troubled faces. is it just our imagination? or is the light on
     the floor growing dimmer?

                              audrey
               you mean...tonight? with all those things
               still out there?

                              paris
               oh, sure. why not? sounds like a hoot.

                              johns
               back it up. how long can this last? few
               minutes? couple hours?

     no one knows for sure.

                              imam
               i had the impression...from the model...
               that the two planets were moving as one.
               that there would be...a lasting darkness.

                              johns
               those suns gotta come back sometime. and
               if these animals really are phobic about
               light, we just sit tight till then.

                              fry
               i'm sure that's what someone else said.
               locked inside that coring room.

     a persuasive thought. eyes swing back to audrey.

                              johns
               look, we gotta think about everyone now --
               the kid especially. how scared is she
               gonna be out there?

                              fry
               oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
               screen.

                              johns
               smoke screen for what?

                              fry
               for your own fear.

                              johns
                         (eyes narrowing)
               hey. why don't you rag your hole for two
               seconds and let someone else come up with
               a plan that doesn't involve mass suicide?

     two seconds pass.

                              fry
               how much you weigh, johns?

                              johns
               what the hell's it matter?

                              fry
               how much?

                              johns
               79 kilos.

                              fry
               because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
               meat, and that's why you can't come up
               with a better plan.

     he makes a move for her. riddick blocks. johns' shotgun bumps
     the underside of riddick's chin.

                              riddick
               think about that reward, johns.

                              johns
               i'm willing to take a cut in pay.

                              riddick
               how 'bout a cut in your gut?

     johns looks down. camera drops to reveal the shiv riddick holds,
     poised for evisceration.

                              johns
               oh, trash baby, you're gonna regret this.

                              imam
               please...this solves nothing...please....

     johns backs off first. the light grows dimmer.

                              fry
                         (to audrey)
               they're afraid of our light. that means
               we don't have to be so afraid of them.

                              imam
               and you're certain you can find the way
               back? even in the dark?

                              fry
               no, i'm not. but he can.

     she's pointing, of course, to riddick.
