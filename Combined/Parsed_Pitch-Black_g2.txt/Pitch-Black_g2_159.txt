     ext. crash ship - night

     close on a burning wick. alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
     create...

     a fireball. two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
     belch fireballs into the night. by this light and more, we see...

     imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. beside
     him, johns fumbles with a second harness. hands help him into
     the chains. the hands belong to...

     riddick. both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
     his captor into chains.

                              fry
                         (to all)
               keep the light going. that's all we have
               to do to live through this. just keep
               your light burning.

     riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
     down his back. a beacon.

                              riddick
                         (to fry)
               be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. i want
               light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
               and check your cuts. these things know
               our blood now.

     close on audrey. overhearing, she goes stone-faced.

                              fry
               riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
               kind of deal. just in case, you know,
               this actually --

                              riddick
                         (shaking head)
               had it with deals.

                              fry
               but i just wanted to say --

                              riddick
               nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
               i fuckin' knew better.

     it worries fry. "if he doesn't expect to go free...."

                              riddick (cont'd)
               been a long time since anyone's trusted
               me. that's somethin' right there.

                              fry
               we can, can't we? trust you?

                              riddick
               actually...
                         (completely genuine)
               that's what i been askin' myself.

     he walks away. hold on fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
     terrible, terrible mistake.
