     ext. crevice - the gauntlet - night

     audrey and imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: this is
     all they could harvest. presently scrabbling sounds on the
     shield. imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. he
     can't see much until...

     a blade rushes through the hole. imam recoils hard, snatches up
     the glow-worm light to see...

     more predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. the
     light drives them away. for now.
