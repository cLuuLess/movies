     fry's pov: of the ground. the sand-cat tracks have vanished.

                              johns
               so you noticed too?

                              fry
               riddick. riddick.

     the procession grinds to a halt. everyone sucks hard on
     breathers as they muster inside the light.

                              fry
               where are the sand-cat tracks? why aren't
               we still following them?

                              riddick
               saw something i didn't like.

                              johns
               such as.

                              riddick
               hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
               but looked like a bunch of those big boys
               chewin' each other's gonads off. thought
               we'd swing wide. okay by you?

     paris looks over his shoulder. "we went around what?" nearby
     clicking breaks up the confrontation.

                              fry
               let's move.
                         (to audrey)
               just a detour. he'll get us there.

                              paris
               can we switch?

                              fry
               what, switch what?

                              paris
               i think i twisted my ankle running
               backwards like that. and i'm not sure i
               can....
                         (off their stares)
               okay, that's a lie. i just don't want to
               be alone back there anymore. if you could
               just give me a few minutes up front here --

                              johns
               she's the pilot, she should stay close to
               the cells.

                              paris
               oh, so i'm disposable?

                              fry
               i'll switch, i'll switch! christ, just
               get this train moving!
