     ext. crash ship - day

     shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
     and the ship.

     the chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.

     riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, johns the second.
     they're racing the eclipse and each other.
