     int. skiff - day

     alone inside the skiff, johns and fry continue with more privacy.

                              fry
                         (jarred)
               he can pilot?

                              johns
               hijacked a prison transport, made a
               helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down.

                              fry
                         (with faint hope)
               okay, maybe that's a good thing. maybe i
               can use him to help with --

                              johns
               he also figured out how to kill the pilot,
               fry.

     a mental shiver.

                              fry
               you said we were going to trust him now.
               you said there was a deal.

                              johns
               that's what i said.

     he challenges her to read his mind.

                              fry
               oh, this is a dangerous game you're
               playing, johns.

                              johns
               may've noticed chains don't work on this
               guy. only way we're truly safe is if he
               believes he's goin' free. but if he stops
               believin' --

                              fry
               you mean, if he learns that you're gonna
               royally fuck him over.

                              johns (cont'd)
               -- we need a fail-safe. bring the cells
               over at the last possible minute -- when
               the wings are ready, when we know we're
               ready to launch.

     fry looks at him with new eyes.

                              fry
               you know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
               far as i can tell, he hasn't even lied
               to us. just stick to the deal, johns.
               let him go if that's what it --

                              johns
               he's a murderer. the law says he's gotta
               do his bid.

     shaking her head, she looks off.

                              fry
               dancin' on razor blades here...

                              johns
               i won't give him a chance to grab another
               ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
