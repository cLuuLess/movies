     ext. crash ship - day

     war-pick in hand, paris eases to ground-level. he checks the
     perimeter, looks inside the ship. nobody. is he being fucked
     with? again? he hopes?

                              paris
               audrey? oh, audrey....

                              audrey (o.s.)
               what?

     paris spins. the voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
     he expected.
