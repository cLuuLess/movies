     ext. muddy rise - the gauntlet - night

     working like sisyphus, riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
     he stops at the top, peers through the rain.

     riddick's pov: of the settlement.

     riddick disappears over the rise. the four cells follow,
     slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.
