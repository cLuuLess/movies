     int. main cabin - crash ship - day

     start on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. staring at it
     is...

     riddick. with his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
     he can't get near it. or can he? near the ceiling, the bulkhead
     is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.

     riddick stands. with a gruesome popping, he dislocates both
     shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
     the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. a
     body-flex pops his shoulders back into joint.

     free, he reaches for the cutting torch.
