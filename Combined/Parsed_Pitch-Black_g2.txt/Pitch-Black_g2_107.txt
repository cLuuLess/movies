                         (answering audrey)
               well, just a skiff. disposable, really.

                              paris
               like an emergency life-raft, right?

                              shazza
               sure. coulda had a real drop-ship take
               them off-planet. long gone.

                              paris
               a toast to their ghosts, then....

     goblets rise.

                              riddick
               didn't leave, these people. whatever got
               zeke got them. they're all dead.

     it's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.

                              riddick (cont'd)
               what, you don't really think they left
               with their clothes on the lines? photos
               on the walls?

                              shazza
               maybe they had weight limits, you don't
               know.

                              riddick
               i know you don't uncrate your emergency
               ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

                              johns
               rag it, riddick. nobody wants your
               theories on --

                              fry
                         (to riddick)
               so what happened? where are they, then?

     fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
     glance its way. at the window, imam scans outside.

                              imam
               has anyone seen the young one? ali?

                              riddick
                         (to fry and imam)
               has anyone checked the coring room?
