     int. main cabin - day

     impact. johns blows out of his locker -- and wishes to god he
     would've stayed inside, because just beside him...

     the hull is cracking open.

     nightmare shot: a huge section of the cabin tears free...
     skitters and crashes along the planetfloor behind us...and
     disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
     40 lives.
