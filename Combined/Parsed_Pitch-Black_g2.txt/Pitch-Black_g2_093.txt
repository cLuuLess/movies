     int. main cabin - crash ship - day

     a shadow falls over riddick. he doesn't look up.

                              riddick
               found somethin' worse than me, huh?

                              johns
               we're movin'. and i'm just wondering if
               i shouldn't lighten the load right now.

     now their eyes meet. johns ratchets his shotgun and points it
     at riddick's head.

                              riddick
               woof, woof.

     the shotgun explodes. camera pans off of johns to show
     riddick still alive. the shotgun discharged next to his head and
     blew off his wrist chains.

                              johns
               want you to remember this moment, riddick.
               the way it coulda gone and didn't.

                              riddick
                         (deaf)
               say that again.

                              johns
               here's the deal. you work without the
               chains, without the bit -- without the
               shivs. you help us get off this rock....

                              riddick
               for what? the honor of goin' back to some
               asshole of a cell?

                              johns
               truth is, riddick, i'm tired of this
               head-up shit. i wanna be free of you as
               much as you wanna be free of me.

     a beat. the future rearranges in riddick's head.

                              riddick
               you'd cut me loose, boss?

                              johns
               only if we both get outta this alive.
               and there may be a way.

     he offers a hand to help riddick up, to seal the deal.

                              riddick
                         (staring at hand)
               my recommendation: do me. don't take
               the chance that i'll get shiv-happy on
               your wannabe ass. ghost me, riddick.
               would if i were you.

                              johns
               if you were me, i'd kill us both. c'mon,
               you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

     a beat. riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
     shotgun with his off-hand. a blur of movement. suddenly johns
     is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.

                              riddick
               want you to remember this moment.

     he pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over johns. he drops the
     emptied gun and walks away.
