     int. living quarters - settlement - day

     fry enters a dark room.

                              fry
               lights.

     no response to her command. she pats around for old-style wall
     switches. nothing. perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
     throws them open to reveal...

     a man standing right outside.

                              johns
                         (through window)
               hey. don't go too far, huh?

     fry nods. johns smiles, leaves. just as her heart settles,
     something creaks behind her.

     it's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
     planets around their suns. solar powered, the orrery starts
     turning, creaking. one planet seems always to have sunlight.

                              fry
               no darkness. no lights because no
               darkness....
