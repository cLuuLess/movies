     int. skull - boneyard - day

     pilgrim #3, inside the skull. johns enters and chases him out.
     about to leave, johns notices...

     bone-chippings piled on the ground. it could be nothing, but
     still...

     johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
     shotgun. satisfied, johns exits. now boom up to reveal...

     riddick. hidden in a sinus cavity.
