     ext. crash ship - deep dusk

     still on the ground, riddick checks left and right like someone
     about to cross a busy street. now he gets up, smacks his hands
     clean, strolls for the hold. behind him...

     a rising gang-clicking.

     close on fry. she knows the sound better than anyone.
