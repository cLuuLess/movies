     int. spire - day

                              fry
               i'm over here in the --

     something tugs on her chain.

                              fry
               oh, god....

     close on her feet. kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
     out footholds.

     a stronger tug. fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

     the madly clicking lair below.

     she tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
     undo the belt. suddenly...

     something explodes near her head. daylight appears, followed by
     faces, human faces. they're breaking through the spire with the
     pick-ax. hands reach inside...
