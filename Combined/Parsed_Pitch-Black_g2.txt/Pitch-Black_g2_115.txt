     int. coring room - day

                              shazza
               why was the door chained up? why the
               bloody hell would they lock themselves in
               like that?

                              johns
               not sure, but tell you what: chrislams
               better not be diggin' another grave out
               there.

                              riddick (o.s.)
               other buildings weren't secure...

     they turn. riddick enters.

                              riddick (cont'd)
               ...so they ran here. heaviest doors.
               thought they'd be safe inside, but...
                         (looks down shaft)
               someone forget to lock the back door.

     shazza joins him at the shaft. gazing on the human remains:

                              shazza
               so that's what come of me zeke. an' you
               saw it. you was right there.

     riddick nods.

                              shazza (cont'd)
               you were tryin' to kill him too.

                              riddick
                         (shrugging, "not
                          necessarily")
               just wanted his o-2.
                         (a beat)
               though i notice he tried to ghost my ass.
               when he shot up that stranger instead.

     shazza can't deny it. she looks at him differently now, the man
     she once beat while in chains. she takes off her breather.

                              shazza
               take it.

                              riddick
                         (suspicious)
               what, it's broken?

                              shazza
               startin' to acclimate, anyhow. take it.

     riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure o2. johns
     watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of riddick
     being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.

                              johns
                         (to fry)
               let's board this up and get the hell gone.
               they seem to stick to the dark, so if we
               stick to daylight, should be all --

               60 years ago.

                              johns
               wha'?

     coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. fry's been
     scrutinizing them.

                              fry
               core-samples are dated. last one is 60
               years ago. this month.

                              shazza
               yeah? what's special about that?

                              fry
               dunno. maybe nothing, but....

     but now fry remembers...
