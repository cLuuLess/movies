     ext. the gauntlet - night

     they flail on. and now, finally...finally....

     the canyon widens, opening up like some door to heaven. the
     worst sounds fall behind. we can see it in their sweat-sheened
     faces: the faintest hope that maybe they've survived the seventh
     circle of hell. but then...

     the torches spit and sputter.

     audrey hears pattering on the metal shield.

     blood falls anew.

     one torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.

     imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. but this
     blood has no hue.

                              fry
               oh, no. no, no, no....

                              imam
               rain.
