     int. cargo hold - night

     vault-like doors boom closed.

     the survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
     somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
     cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.

                              audrey
               what if...what if she's still out there...
               still alive....

                              johns
               well, i don't want to jump to conclusions
               here...but 'member that boneyard? these
               just might be the fuckers that killed
               every other living thing on this planet,
               okay? chances of shazza knockin' on that
               door anytime soon are just about zero
               squared.

                              fry
                         (agreeing)
               i saw the cut-marks on the bones. wasn't
               a natural die-off.

                              imam
               quiet, please. everyone.

     imam is listening at the cargo door. the others pile up
     alongside, ears tuned like radar. clicking sweeps past outside.

                              audrey
                         (whispering)
               why do they do that? make that sound?

                              imam
               perhaps the way they see. with sound,
               reflecting back.

                              fry
                         (realizing)
               echo-location. that's what it is....

     now more clicking -- behind them. lights whip around to find...

     nothing. only the door of an open container about halfway down
     the tunnel-like hold.

     a volley of looks. "how the fuck could one get in here?"

                              fry
               breach in the hull. i dunno.

     more clicking. johns realizes they expect him to check it out.

                              johns
               i'd rather piss glass.

                              riddick
               well, you got the big gauge.

                              johns
               wanna rag your fat mouth?

                              audrey
               maybe it's just their beads again. imam,
               are you still --

                              imam
               no, no, no, i do not believe --

                              johns
               c'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
               bugfuck with those things. why don't you
               just lose the goddamn....

     more clicking -- along with the sound of toppling cargo.

                              riddick
               big beads.

     butching up, johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...

     the open container. leading with his shotgun, he fires blindly
     around the door. something squeals -- then silence. johns eases
     his head and a light around the door to spot...

     hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.

                              johns
                         (to others)
               okay. we're okay. just some small ones
               that musta --

     something whooshes for his head, swinging like a scythe. it
     catches his shotgun, discharging it, giving us...

     a flash-image of an adult predator. up close.

     in one thin second, johns is back with the others.

                              johns
               very big beads.

                              paris
               not staying in here another....

     he goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
     fry lunges for him.

                              fry
               christ, you don't know what's out there!

                              paris
               i know what's in here!

                              imam
               everybody come, this way and we should be
               safe. hurry, please....
