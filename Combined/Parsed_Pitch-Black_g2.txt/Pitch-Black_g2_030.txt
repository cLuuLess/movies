     ext. crash ship - day

     the survivors straggle outside. camera surveys new faces:

     zeke and shazza. male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
     life. shazza has a tough sexiness. zeke's face shows aboriginal
     blood. (30s.)

     paris. overfed, overgroomed. a puff pastry of a man. (40s or
     50s.)

     four male "chrislams": the pillar-steady imam (50ish), and
     three pilgrims, young and excitable (late-teens). (note: the
     chrislams represent a union between christianity and islam. they
     have the iconography of christians yet the physical look of arab
     muslims.)

     wide shot: all around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
     the valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
     spiked with earthen spires. scorching down on everything are
     two suns -- one red, one yellow.

                              paris
               well. our own little slice of heaven.

     the chrislams fall to their knees. confusion as they try to
     orient themselves.

                              imam
               please...which way to new mecca? we must
               know the direction in order to pray.

     north? south? east? west? nobody knows. johns snaps open a
     compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. the screaming
     inside the ship finally ends.
