     int. fifth container - cargo hold - night

     close on a predator's scythe blade. it test-slices the pilgrim's
     skin. blood wells up. all clicking ceases.

                              imam (o.s.)
               hasan?

                              fry (o.s.)
               riddick?

     tight on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
     stopped. losing his nerve, he bolts.

                              riddick
               no....

     the predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. death-scream.

     riddick's pov: a third predator appears above him.

     making his move, riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
     escape hatch as...

     fry's light catches him square in the face. blinded, riddick
     howls and stumbles forward. fry's light leaps deeper to hit...

     the predator right behind him. with a similar reaction, the
     beast howls and flails back.

     hold on fry for a time-stopped moment. what stopped it? was it
     really her? suddenly a shotgun explodes beside her head. jacked
     up, johns is blasting shadows.

                              fry
               stop it, stop it, stop it!

                              johns
               'sokay, 'sokay. i killed it.

     they give him a look. "sure you did." suddenly a carcass slams
     to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
     pattern. "christ, he did kill one."

     fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
     wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.

                              fry
               there....

                              paris
               like the light is scalding it.

                              fry
               it hurts them. light actually hurts
               them....

     vulture sounds from the two o.s. adolescents, fighting over the
     scraps of the pilgrim.

                              imam
               is that...hasan?

     riddick nods.

                              johns
               we'll burn a candle for him later. c'mon.
