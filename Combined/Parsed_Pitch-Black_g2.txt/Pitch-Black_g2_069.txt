     ext. grave site - spired hills - day

     start on the drag-sled carrying corpse #4-- the stranger.

     zeke reaches the grave. the sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
     blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. zeke starts to
     unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
     there's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.

                              zeke
               now what the bloody hell....

     zeke hops down into the grave. camera moves to reveal riddick
     hidden among the spires. he's been waiting for a chance just
     like this.
