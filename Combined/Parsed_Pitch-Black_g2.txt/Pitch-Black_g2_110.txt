     int. coring room - day

     chaotic shots: more nests explode into individual creatures,
     winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
     slashing. his exit blocked, pilgrim #3 veers into...

     a dark supply room. he slams the door, mumbles a blessing and
     waits for the storm to pass. he's been cut -- but at least he's
     still alive.
