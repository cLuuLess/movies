     ext. night

     fry, imam, audrey, pilgrim #1. they're running, stumbling,
     trying to backtrack the sled marks. checking for pursuit, fry
     looks over her shoulder...

     and crashes into riddick. he was just standing in the dark,
     waiting for them.

                              riddick
               back to the ship, huh?

                              fry
               get out of our way.

                              riddick
               so everybody huddles together till the
               lights burn out? until you can't see
               what's eating you? that the big plan?

                              imam
               where's mr. johns?

                              riddick
               which half?

                              imam
               you mean....

     conflicted, they all look back. audrey starts to puddle up.

                              audrey
               gonna lose everybody out here....

                              riddick
               he died fast. and if we got any choice,
               that's the way we should all go out.
                         (to audrey, softly)
               don't you cry for johns. don't you dare.
