     int. main cabin - crash ship - day

     choking yellow dust. ghostly silhouettes are coughing, moaning,
     calling out to other survivors in english and, surreally, in
     arabic. soon we find...

     johns. ears running blood. stumbling his way to...

     riddick's cryo-locker. empty. johns reaches for his holster.
     gone, torn right off his belt. no prisoner and no weapon --
     spooky combination. nearby he sees...

     the light of a cutting torch. someone's using it to open a
     jammed cryo-locker. the plexi is torched away to reveal...

     audrey, 12 years old. unscathed.

                              audrey
               somethin' went wrong, huh?

     johns searches for his pistol. behind him, two chained feet
     lower into frame -- and then attack, swinging over johns' head...
     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
     a choke-collar. johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

     riddick. still in body chains and mouth-bit. clinging to a
     ceiling support. riding out the baton blows.

     seconds from blacking out, johns strains forward...forward...and
     finally breaks riddick's grip on the support. he keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that...

     riddick slams headfirst into the deck. johns lays the baton on
     his neck.

                              johns
               one chance and you blew it, riddick.
               never cease to disappoint me.
