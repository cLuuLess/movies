     int. fifth container - cargo hold - night

     inside their fifth container now, johns torches away. fry and
     paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
     cargo with their bodies.

     riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
     cargo. suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...

                              paris
               hello, hello?

     ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
     prevails. something squishes underfoot. he slips off goggles.

     riddick's pov: of dead hatchlings on the floor. this is the
     open container, the one where johns found predators.

     sensing energy, riddick lifts his face.

     riddick's pov: of an adolescent predator. it squats atop cargo,
     eating a hatchling. a heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.

     sensing riddick, it sweeps the area with inquisitive clicks.

     predator pov: of riddick.

     (note: the predator pov is a crude image that gives impression
     without detail. we're "seeing" what the predator hears with
     echo-location. think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
     subject in 3-d space.)

     oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. audrey,
     fry, and johns worm through. imam and pilgrim #2 hang back.
     "where's riddick?"

     he's in a stare-down with a predator.

     searching, pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
     caught in a vice-like grip.

                              riddick
               don't. move.

     riddick's pov: as a second predator appears above them. this
     one reaches down with its scythe blade...

     and gently probes the two men. it wants know what they're made
     of.

     close on the pilgrim's shoes. over-running with piss.

     more blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
     one test-slices riddick's shirt.
