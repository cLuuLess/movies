     ext. top of crash ship - day

     fry climbs onto the back of the ship. johns paris, zeke, shazza,
     audrey are already here.

                              johns
               big talk about a scouting party...

     fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
     one glance confirms that there are no other survivors.

                              johns (cont'd)
               ...then we saw this.

                              paris
               anyone else having breathing problems?
               aside from me?

                              audrey
               like i just ran, or something....

                              shazza
               feel one lung short. all of us.

                              paris
               well, i tend toward the asthmatic. and
               with all this dust....

     faces turn to fry: they're looking to her for answers.

                              fry
               it's the atmosphere. too much pressure,
               not enough oxygen. might take a few days
               to --

                              zeke
               so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

                              fry
               somethin' knocked us off-lane. maybe a
               rogue comet. maybe we'll never know.

                              shazza
               well, i for one, am thoroughly fucking
               grateful. this beast wasn't made to land
               like this. but cripes, you rode it down.
                         (to others)
               c'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
               we're alive is a'cuzza her.

     others chime agreement, laying thankful hands on fry's shoulders.
     hold on fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
     savior.
