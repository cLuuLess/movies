     ext. skiff - night

     they meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- fry in the rain,
     riddick in the light.

                              riddick
               strong survival instinct. admire that in
               a woman.

                              fry
               you're not leaving. not until we go back
               for the others.

     he laughs at that.

                              fry (cont'd)
               i promised them we'd go back with more
               light. and that's exactly what we're
               gonna do..

                              riddick
               think you've mistaken me for somebody who
               gives a fuck.

                              fry
               what, you're afraid?

                              riddick
               confusin' me with johns now -- fear was
               his monkey. i only deal in life and
               death. all that stuff in between? some
               shade of grey my eyes don't see.

                              fry
               i trusted you, riddick. goddamn, i
               trusted that some part of you wanted to
               rejoin the human race.

                              riddick
               truthfully? i wouldn't know how.

     fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. with
     desperation edging her voice:

                              fry
               then wait for me. i'll go back myself.
               just give me more light for them.

     he tosses her a light. the broken one.

                              fry
               just come with me!

                              riddick
               got a better idea. come with me.

     fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.

                              riddick (cont'd)
               they're already dead. get on board.

                              fry
               you're fuckin' with me. i know you are.

                              riddick
               'course i am -- but doesn't mean i won't
               leave you here. if you believe anything
               about me, better be that.

                              fry
               no, you see, i promised them...i have
               to...i have to go and....

     she's bleeding resolve. riddick can see it -- can smell it --
     and he keeps slashing away.

                              riddick
               step aboard, carolyn.

                              fry
                         (tortured)
               i can't....i can't....

                              riddick
                         (approaching, extending
                          a hand)
               here. make it easy on you.

                              fry
               don't do this to me....

                              riddick
               just give me your hand.

                              fry
               but they...they could still be....

                              riddick
               no one's gonna blame you. c'mon. take my
               hand and save yourself, carolyn.

     a beat. she takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
     they sprawl through mud. she gets a knee on his neck.

                              fry
               i will not give up on them! i will not
               leave anyone on this rock with those
               fucking things, even if it means --

     in a blur, riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. is
     history repeating itself? riddick's face, though, is strangely
     calm. curious. even gentle.

                              riddick
               you'd die for them?

                              fry
               i would try for them.

                              riddick
               you barely know them.

                              fry
               but i'm human. i know you view that as a
               weakness, but i'm sorry -- i do feel fear,
               theirs too. goddamnit, riddick -- yes.
               i would die for them.
