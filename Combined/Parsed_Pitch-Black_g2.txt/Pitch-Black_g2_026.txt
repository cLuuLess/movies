     int. flight deck - day

     hammered by wind, fry opens her eyes experimentally.

     fry's pov: a vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
     but the ship is burrowing in. burrowing under.

     fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
     dirt avalanches into the cockpit. it buries camera.

                                                       blackout
