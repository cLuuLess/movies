     ext. skiff - settlement - day

     johns descends the gangway -- and finds riddick erecting a field
     table in the shade of the skiff. he seems out of earshot. now,
     anyway. as they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
     through johns.

                              riddick
               bad sign. shakin' like that in this heat.

     johns moves on. the chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
     vectran (wing-fabric material). they drop it on the table.
     ready to cut bindings, imam pats his hip for the knife that was
     just there.

                              riddick
                         (looking after johns)
               i'll cut.

     he has the knife.
