     ext. top of crash ship - day

     close on caviar being added to toast-points.

     a scrabbling sound stops paris in mid-bite. he eases out of his
     rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

     a shadow ducking under him. small rocks still trickle down a
     dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

                              paris
               this now qualifies as the worst fun i've
               ever had. stop it.

     no response.
