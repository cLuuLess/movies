     ext. skull - boneyard - day

     pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
     wind hitting the comb makes a low harmonic moaning. by
     moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" dirgelike
     music. wanting to show off the trick:

                              pilgrim #1
               ah....

     he looks for pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. and when he turns
     back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. but
     it's only...
