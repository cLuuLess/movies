     ext. start of gauntlet - night

     they are but five: fry, riddick, audrey, imam, and pilgrim #1.
     close on each face as they listen to the canyon. there must be
     countless predators ahead.

                              fry
               how many you see?

                              riddick
               one or two.

                              fry
               audrey?

                              audrey
               three full bottles. but almost time to
               refill.

                              fry
               doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
               does it?

                              riddick
               only see one way. turn the sled over and
               drag it like that, girl down low. light
               up everything we got -- and run through
               like dogs on fire.

     a beat.

                              imam
                         (understanding)
               the sled as a shield....

                              fry
               and what about the cells?

                              riddick
               i'll take those.

     she looks at him hard.

                              fry
               we're just here to carry your light,
               aren't we? just the torch-bearers.

                              riddick
               let's drop back an' boot up.
