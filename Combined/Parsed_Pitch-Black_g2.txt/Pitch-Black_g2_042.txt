     ext. crash ship - day

     johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. he
     fixates on...

     a blue glow on the horizon. "what the hell is it?"

     zeke and shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
     and ball-floats. the prototype is tested on audrey. she sucks
     on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
     demand rather than in a constant flow.

     chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
     travel.

     fry finishes wrapping owens' body. she looks to the yellow sun,
     low on the horizon. the red sun seems inclined to follow.

                              fry
               imam. we should leave soon. before
               nightfall but while it's cooler.

                              zeke
               what, you're goin' off, too?

                              fry
               johns is leaving you a gun. just do me a
               favor, huh? get my crewies buried? they
               were good guys who died bad.

                              shazza
               a'course we will.

                              pilgrim #1 (o.s.)
               imam...imam....

     (note: "imam" is pronounced "el-ee-mam.")

     fry and the others round the ship to see...

     a blue star flaring into view. it's rising as the other suns are
     setting.

                              shazza
               my bloody oath....

                              audrey
               three suns?

                              zeke
                         (to fry)
               so much for your nightfall.

                              paris
               so much for my cocktail hour.

                              imam
               we take this to be a good sign -- a path,
               a direction from god.

     johns swings down from the top of the ship.

                              johns
               a very good sign.
                         (re: blue sun)
               that's riddick's direction. you do not
               wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.

                              fry
               thought you found his restraints over
               there. toward sunset.

                              johns
                         (nodding)
               which means he went toward sunrise.
