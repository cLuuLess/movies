     int. first container - cargo hold - night

     imam shepherds them into a container. the door slams closed.
     at first, only the sound of mouths sucking breathers. then a
     scratching.

     johns fumbles with a cutting torch. gets it burning. adjusts
     the gasses to illuminate...

     the door. scythe-like blades are probing joints. suddenly heavy
     blows drive everyone back.

                              riddick
                         (to johns)
               can you do sumpin' else with that?
               'sides holding it in my fucking face?

     taking the hint, johns starts cutting the common wall between
     containers. it's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
     blades of the predators.
