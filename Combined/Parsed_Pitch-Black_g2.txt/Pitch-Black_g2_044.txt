     ext. crash ship - day

     paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. he deals with
     the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: he fills a reservoir
     with liquor, dials up a regulator. umbrella spars shoot bursts
     of cooling alcohol vapor. paris luxuriates in it.

                              zeke (o.s.)
               comfy up there?

     zeke appears below. he loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
     cable, pick-ax.

                              paris
               amazing how you can do without the
               essentials of life -- so long as you have
               the luxuries.

                              zeke
               well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
               open. don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
               on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

     he drags the sled toward the spired hills. keeping one eye on
     zeke, paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
     pours himself a spot of sherry. as he sips, a blade touches his
     throat.

                              audrey
               he'd probably get you right here, right
               under the jaw. and you'd never hear him
               coming. that's how good riddick is.

     paris eases the hunting boomerang away.

                              paris
               now did you run away from your parents?
               or did they run away from you?
