     ext. the gauntlet - night

     first come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
     then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. next
     come feral sounds overhead.

                              riddick
               don't look.

     thin blue liquid spatters them.

                              riddick
               do not look up.

     more spattering. fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

     a ceiling of predators. at the cusp of light, they dive and
     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to sound
     out the humans below. it's like looking into a bucket of angry
     eels.

                              riddick
               keep going, keep going, keep going,
               keep going!

     his voice whips them like the devil's coxswain. chastened, fry
     keeps her eyes down and speed up.

     more blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
     out of the sky. could this be hell itself?

                              imam
                         (a muttered mantra)
               "so dark the clouds around my way
                    i cannot see,
               but through the darkness i believe
                    god leadeth me.
               i gladly place my hand in his when
                    all is dim,
               and, closing my weary eyes, lean
                    hard on him...."

     now whole corpses are crashing down around them, victims
     of in-fighting. fry and imam start slaloming through the ghastly
     mess.

     pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: a blade slices his leg,
     drawing blood. he keeps his mouth shut.
