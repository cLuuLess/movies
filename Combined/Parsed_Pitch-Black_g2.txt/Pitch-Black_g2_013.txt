     int. nav-bay - main cabin

                              owens
               ...showing no major water bodies...maximum
               terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
               largely cinder and gypsum with some
               evaporite deposits....

     jettison doors close behind owens, segregating him from the
     passenger compartment. it scares him for a new reason.

                              owens
               fry? what're you doing?
