     ext. crash ship - deep dusk

     reaching the cargo hold, riddick turns around for one last look.
     push in as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
     jaguar eyes.

     riddick's pov: in degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
     hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. they're large, mammalian,
     hammer-headed. they click with echo-location, sounding out the
     world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.

                              fry
               what is it? what's happening?

     riddick's pov: the predators launch from the hills, gliding,
     sounding, searching.

                              riddick
               like i said. ain't me you gotta worry
               about.
