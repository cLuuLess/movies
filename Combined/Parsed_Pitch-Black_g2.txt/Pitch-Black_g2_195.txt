     ext. skiff - night

     drenched in light, riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
     looking out into dark rain. is he struggling with a decision?
     or just savoring the safe harbor? then very deliberately...

     riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. he steps inside and
     closes the hatch behind him.
