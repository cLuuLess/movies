     ext. crash ship - night

     cargo doors crack open. mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
     pushed outside and swept around. fry appears behind it.

     moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
     to heed the primal sounds beyond their light. soon they reach...

     the main cabin. blackness inside.

                              fry
               riddick.

     he lifts his goggles.

     riddick's pov: checking the cabin. finding a lot of wreckage
     but no life.

                              riddick
               looks clear.

     johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. just as he stands up
     inside...

     a predator buzzsaws over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
     into the night.

                              johns
               fuck me. you said "clear."

                              riddick
               said "looks clear."

                              johns
               well, what's it look like now?

                              riddick
                         (rechecking)
               looks clear.

                              fry
               just get the goddamn lights on....

     they scramble aboard. riddick tongue-clicks behind johns.
     he isn't amused.
