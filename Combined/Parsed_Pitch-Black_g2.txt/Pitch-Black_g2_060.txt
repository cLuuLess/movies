     int. main room - settlement - day

     through a window, we see the johns and the chrislams crawling
     over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. pull back to
     include fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

     refectory table. place settings out. years of dust.

     photos on the wall: settlers working modest gardens. playing
     baseball. posing with children.
