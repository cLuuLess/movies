     ext. settlement - night

     riddick's pov: ahead of us, we see fry, imam, and audrey
     vanishing around the corner. breathing like a racehorse, we
     follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. suddenly
     a predator is right there, right in our face.

     predator's pov: of riddick skidding to a stop. he snaps a look
     up.

     riddick's pov: of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
     building. it speed-clicks at us.

     predator's pov: of riddick slowly pulling two shivs. bracing
     himself. ready to blade it out.
