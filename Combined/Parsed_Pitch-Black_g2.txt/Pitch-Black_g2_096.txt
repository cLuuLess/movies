     ext. skiff - day

                              paris
               i mean, usually i can appreciate antiques,
               but, uh....

     the survivors have reached the settlement. fry is trying to get
     the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.

                              johns
               little ratty-ass.

                              fry
               nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
               electrical adapts.

                              shazza
               not a star-jumper.

                              riddick
               doesn't need to be. use this to get back
               up to the sol-track shipping lanes, stick
               out a thumb. you'll get picked up.
                         (to fry)
               right?

     fry looks from riddick to johns. "how did he know that?"

                              fry
               little help here?

     they muscle the power cell aboard. riddick starts to follow, but
     johns blocks. he doesn't want riddick inside.

                              johns
               check those containers for me. see what
               we can patch wings with.
