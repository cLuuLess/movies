     int. main cabin - crash ship - night

     reloading his shotgun, johns finds himself shaking again. he
     unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
     lover's look. behind him...

                              fry
               ready, johns.

     he palms the shell.

                              johns
               he'll lead you over the first cliff.
               you know that, don't you?

                              fry
               we're just burnin' light here.

                              johns
               you give him the cells and the ship --
               and he will leave you. he will leave you
               all out there to die.

                              fry
               i don't get it, johns. what is so goddamn
               valuable in your life that you're worried
               about losing? huh? is there anything at
               all? besides your next hype?
                         (no response)
               got no right to be so scared. neither one
               of us.
