     int. private room - settlement - day

     closeups: hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
     pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
     the ampule into a injection syringe. the syringe touches an
     eager arm vein.

                              fry (o.s.)
               who are you? really?

     shirt off, johns looks up. she's in the doorway.

                              fry (cont'd)
               you're not a real cop, are you? just some
               mercenary who goes around talkin' about
               the law like --

                              johns
               i never said i was.

                              fry
               never said you were a hype, either.

     she moves closer. rummages through his stuff brazenly. finds a
     shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.

                              johns
               you have a little caffeine in the morning,
               i have a little morphine. so what?

                              fry
               and here you got two mornings every day.
               wow, were you born lucky?

                              johns
               not a problem unless you're gonna make --

                              fry
                         (lashing)
               you made it a problem when you let owens
               die like that. when you had enough drugs
               to knock out a fucking mule-team.

                              johns
               owens was already dead. his brain just
               hadn't caught on to that fact.

                              fry
               anything else we should know about you,
               johns? christ, here i am lettin' you play
               games with our lives when --

     he catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
     her into an embrace. we understand why when we see a closeup
     of her hands: they find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.

                              johns
               my first run-in with riddick. went for
               the sweet-spot and missed. they had to
               leave a piece of the shiv in there. i can
               feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
               cord.
                         (giving her hands back)
               so maybe the care and feeding of my
               nerve-endings is my business.

                              fry
               you coulda helped. and you didn't.

     o.s., we hear the chrislams jabbering arabic and calling for
     "captain, captain...."

                              johns
               yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
               right, "captain"?

     it cuts deep.
