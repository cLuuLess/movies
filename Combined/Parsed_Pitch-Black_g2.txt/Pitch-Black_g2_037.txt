               200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
               "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

                         (cracking a bottle)

               one of the christian habits we didn't
               adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. we'll
               have to wait.

                              johns
               for what? there is no water. you
               understand that, don't you?

                              imam

               shall lead us there.
