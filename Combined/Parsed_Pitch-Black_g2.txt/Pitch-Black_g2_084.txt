     int. the lair - day

     another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. shafts
     of daylight bore down into the room. more old bones litter the
     floor. fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...

     an earthen funnel. the inside of a spire.

                              fry
               they're hollow....

     click-click.

     fry slow-turns toward the sound.

     click-click-click.

     there's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
     something unfolding.

     an icy hand grips her heart. soundlessly, fry backtracks her
     chain, but...

     something shadows across the exit. it stops her cold.

     her hand finds something new. she angles it to the light. it's
     one of zeke's boots -- with a bit of zeke still in it.

     clickity-clickity-clickity....

     the whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
     skulking the perimeter, circling.

     something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. it
     was faster than a lightning-strike.

     a paralyzed beat before...

     fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
     springing straight up into...
