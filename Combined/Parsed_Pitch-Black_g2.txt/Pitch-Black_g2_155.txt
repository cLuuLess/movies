     int. main cabin - crash ship - night

     prep montage: we see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
     yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
     cord through paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
     with high-octane liquor...swapping out o2 canisters.
