     int. flight deck - day

                              owens
               look, fry. company says we're responsible
               for every one of those --

                              fry
               company's not here, is it?

                              owens
               when captain went down, you stepped up --
               whether you like it or not. now they
               train you for this, so --

                              fry
               and there wasn't a simulated cockroach
               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
               crash site! that's how they train you!
               on a fucking simulator!

     owens unbuckles from his chair.

                              owens
               don't touch that switch!

     overcome by guilt, fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
     but a huge jolt puts the thumb right back.

                              fry
               i'm not dying for them.

     she pushes it. but this time...
