     ext. skiff - day

                              fry
               allahu akbar!

     fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. the others catch
     up. they too marvel at...

     the skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
     plane, part space craft. its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
     the hull looks intact.
