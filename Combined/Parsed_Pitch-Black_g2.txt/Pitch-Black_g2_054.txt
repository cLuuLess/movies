     int. skull - boneyard - day

     trying again, riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
     slices off some of fry's hair. a locket. a souvenir. that's
     all he wanted.

                              fry (o.s.)
               so now you know.

                              johns (o.s.)
               fuck. guess i'm more glad to be here than
               i thought.

     riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
     left behind. it's still got one good swallow.
