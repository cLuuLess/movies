               ... crisis program selected number two of
               this system because it shows at least some
               oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
               shut the fuck up!
                         (hammers a button,
                          silences alarms)
               -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
               at surface-level. okay, so maybe the ship
               did something right for a change....
