     ext. canyon rim - the gauntlet - night

     black screen. we hear the canyon in full cry now -- clicking...
     battling bone-blades...mating cries...the rending of flesh
     and snapping of tendon. far below, twin flames appear as the
     survivors reach the gauntlet. predators perch in foreground,
     just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.
