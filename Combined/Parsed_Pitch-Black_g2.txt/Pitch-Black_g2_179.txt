     ext. boneyard - night

     start on the power cells. they're been lashed together into one
     queue.

     working amid the giant bones, riddick crafts a new harness from
     the old straps. close behind him, imam is muttering in arabic.

                              riddick
               what're you doin'?

                              imam
               blessing you like the others.
                         (off his look)
               it's painless.

                              riddick
               and pointless.

                              imam
                         (a beat)
               i see. well, even if you don't believe
               in god, it doesn't mean he won't be --

                              riddick
               you don't see.

     riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.

                              riddick (cont'd)
               'cuz you don't spend half your life in
               lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
               and not believe. and you surely don't
               start out in a liquor store trash bin with
               an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
               and not believe. oh, absolutely i believe
               in god. and i absolutely hate the fucker.

                              imam
               he will be with us. nonetheless.

                              riddick
               give my blessing to the girl. she needs
               a spare.
