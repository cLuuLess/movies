               look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
               different than those battlefield doctors
               when they have to decide who lives and who
               dies. it's called "triage," okay?

                              riddick
               kept calling it "murder" when i did it.

                              johns
               either way, figure it's something you can
               grab onto.

               sacrifice play. hack up one body, leave
               it at start of the canyon. like a bucket
               of chum.

                              johns
               trawl with it. there's a cable on the
               sled. we can drag the body behind us.

               nice embellishment.

                              johns
               don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
               keep 'em off our scent.

                              riddick
                         (looking back)
               so which one caught your eye?

                              johns
               don' look, don' look, don' look....
