     ext. boneyard - night

     johns falls in step with riddick.

                              johns
               ain't all of us gonna make it.

                              riddick
               just realized that, huh?

     clicking nearby. johns blasts the night, driving the sound
     away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the big gauge.

                              johns
               six of us left. if we could get through
               that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
               quite a fucking feat, huh? a good thing,
               right?

                              riddick
               not if i'm the one.

                              johns
               what if you're one of five?

     riddick stares. "i'm listening."
