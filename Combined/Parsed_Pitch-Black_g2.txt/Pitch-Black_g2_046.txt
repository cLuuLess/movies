     ext. boneyard - day

     moving into the boneyard:

                              imam
               some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
               like the elephants of earth....

     fry touches one of the towering bones. it shows cut-marks --
     almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "graveyard? or
     killing field?"

                              johns
               long time ago. whatever happened.
