     int. main cabin - crash ship - day

     johns helps fry through the carnage. she's stunned by it all --
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

     realizing she's in nav-bay, fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover...

     owens. still strapped to his chair. metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart. dead. fry reaches out to touch him.

                              owens
               out, out, out, get it outta me!

     she recoils hard. he's still alive. the other survivors bungle
     over. ten seconds of pure chaos:

                              voices
               pull it out of him...no, it's too close to
               the heart...you gotta do it, just do it
               fast....

     fry grabs the rod.

                              owens
               don't touch it! don't touch that switch!

                              voices
               you'll kill him, i'm tellin' you, shit,
               just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
               you got some drugs for this poor man....

                              owens
               don't touch that switch!

                              fry
               awright, awright, someone...there's
               anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
               the cabin...next to....

     but there is no more "that end." in exquisite pain, owens
     screams on. reaction shots of johns, audrey. seldom are human
     beings witness to such raw suffering.

                              fry
               get away. everybody.

     the others leave -- except for audrey, staying behind to watch
     in morbid fascination. johns doubles back and collars her.
     leaving, they pass...

     riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. his eyes, still hidden by
     goggles, track johns and audrey toward daylight.
