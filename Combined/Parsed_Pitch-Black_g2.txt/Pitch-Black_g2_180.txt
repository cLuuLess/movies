     ext. start of gauntlet - night

     the torches. maxed out. burning non-stop.

     fry and imam. sled chains on. lapping up o2. each holding a
     torch.

     pilgrim #1. clutching a handlight.

     audrey. rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
     metal carapace.

     riddick. goggles on. he has no desire to see what horrors will
     surround them. there's just one path, anyway: straight through.

                              riddick
               as fast as you can.

                              fry
               you sure you can keep --

                              riddick
               as fast as you can.
