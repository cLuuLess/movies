     int. skiff - night

     close on a bloody hand. it toggles through nav-charts, plots a
     rendezvous with "sol-track 17b" shipping lane.

     in the cockpit, riddick finds audrey beside him. she stares
     hypnotically at the stars ahead.

                              riddick
               probably okay to talk to me now.

                              audrey
               not sure where to go. i was just runnin'
               away when this whole thing started.
                         (a beat)
               where you goin'?

                              riddick
               not sure. i was just runnin' away when
               this whole thing....

     interior smiles. stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
     a course-correction. one very bright star comes into view.

                              riddick
               might interest you....

     imam moves forward. seeing, his face lifts.

                              imam
               new mecca....

                              riddick
               think a soul could get lost there? with
               all those pilgrim-types?

                              imam
               it's more a place where souls are found,
               mr. riddick.

     as riddick ponders the possibilities, we cut to...
