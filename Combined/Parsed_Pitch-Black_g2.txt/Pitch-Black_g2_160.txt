     ext. night

     the drag-sled begins moving.

     series of tracking shots: riddick running point, goggles off,
     eyes flashing. johns and imam pulling the drag-sled like
     malamutes, handlights sweeping. pilgrims #1 at the first side-
     guard position, fry and audrey at the second, each position
     carrying an umbrella torch, fireballs blazing. paris stumbling
     along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
     shadow a threat. they are a train of light.

     close on the sled. holding four power cells and eight bottles
     of booze.

     close on fry. looking down. noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.
