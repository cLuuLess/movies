     the scouting party approaches a rise. the trees loom just beyond.

                              pilgrims
               allahu akbar...allahu akbar....

     the young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
     oasis. but fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
     they don't move in the wind.

     the pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. fry,
     johns and imam catch up to behold...

     the "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
     tinted green by lichen. beyond is a sea of bleached animal
     bones. impossibly, the bones seem to moan in pain. all told,
     it's like hell overflowed right here.

                              fry
               is this whole planet dead?

     a pilgrim questions imam in arabic.

                              imam
               he asks what could have killed so many
               great things...
