     ext. the gauntlet - day

     fry's pov: of spires high above us.

     the group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
     the spires. fry stops short, hearing...

     clickity-click.

     neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. the group starts
     moving again, faster.

     clickity-clickity-click.

     are they being stalked? nervously, fry traces the sound back
     to...

     beads dangling from the belt of pilgrim #1. whenever he moves,
     the strings clack together.
