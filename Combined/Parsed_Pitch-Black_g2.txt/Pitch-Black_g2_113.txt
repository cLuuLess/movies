     int. coring room - day

     hinges are blasted away. the door caves in. imam shoulders
     past johns to enter and find...

     the empty coring room.

                              imam
               ali?

     a noise from the supply room. is it ali? just too scared to
     come out? imam opens the door...

     and hatchlings pour out.

     moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
     soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
     squeals vanishing to infinity. shocked silence, then...

     pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. he's been shredded into bloody
     kite-tails. there was a nest inside the supply room.

     imam falls on him in grief. johns and fry inch forward to peer
     down...

     the coring shaft. it's littered with human bones. the skeletons
     of the settlers. scattered about and picked clean.
