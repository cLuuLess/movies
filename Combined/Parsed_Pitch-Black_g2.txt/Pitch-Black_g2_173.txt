               awright. you do the girl, i'll keep the
               others off your back.

     riddick stops. reconsiders.

                              johns (cont'd)
               aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

                              riddick
                         (shakes head)
               just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
               piece of chum.

                              johns
               like who, mr. chrislam?

     extremely tight on both men: in their eyes, we see the new
     partnership splintering apart: "like mr. johns."

     riddick makes a play for the shotgun. it blasts skyward.
