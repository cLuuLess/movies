     ext. porch - settlement - day

     fry reaches a porch. it looks out over the rear of the
     settlement and more unforgiving terrain. she starts back
     inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. fry
     turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
     source of the glint.

     excited hits on her breather.

     fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
     bearing. soon she's running.
