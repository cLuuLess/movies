     int. nav bay - crash ship - day

     nav-bay. gathered, the survivors take inventory: johns has a
     pistol, shotgun, baton. zeke and shazza offer up a pick-ax,
     digging tools, hunting boomerang. imam shows a ceremonial blade.
     paris straggles in with antique curios.

                              johns
               what the hell are these?

                              paris
               maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern
               india. very rare.

                              zeke
               an' this?

                              paris
               blow-dart hunting stick from papua new
               guinea. very very rare, since the tribe's
               extinct.

                              zeke
               'cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
               things, be my guess.

                              paris
               well, what's the need, anyway? if he's
               gone, he's gone. why should he bother us?

                              johns
               first, because he can only live out there
               for so long -- he's gonna come back and
               take what we got. second, for the sheer
               thrill of the kill.

     a beat. they all grab for weapons.
