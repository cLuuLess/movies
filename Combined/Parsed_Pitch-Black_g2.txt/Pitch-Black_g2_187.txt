     ext. the gauntlet - night

     caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. one torch
     goes out -- and won't relight.

                              riddick
               so where the hell's god now, huh?
                         (no answer from imam)
               i'll tell you where! he's up there
               pissing on me!

                              fry
               riddick? how close?

     riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. we don't know what he
     sees -- nor what he's thinking.

                              fry
               tell me the settlement is right there!
               riddick, please!

                              riddick
               we can't make it.

     hold on fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
     somewhere behind, the awful sounds return.

                              riddick
               here...hide here....

     he's found a crevice in the canyon wall.

                              riddick
               inside...inside....
