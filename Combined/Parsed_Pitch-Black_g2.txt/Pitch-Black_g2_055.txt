     ext. start of gauntlet - day

     leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
     hills. ahead is a canyon.

                              johns
               hold up.

     he jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

                              johns (cont'd)
               didn't bite.

                              fry
               what?

                              johns
               thought he might be coolin' it in the
               boneyard -- could either double-back to
               the ship or slip in behind us. so i left
               the bottle out as bait.

     scope pov: panning the boneyard. finding the bottle. it's
     still got that one swallow.

                              johns (cont'd)
               but nah. didn't bite.
