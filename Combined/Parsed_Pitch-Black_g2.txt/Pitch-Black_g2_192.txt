     ext. crevice - the gauntlet - night

                              audrey
               he's not coming back, is he?

     fry checks imam's face. did riddick say anything to you?" imam
     wags his head. a bleak beat -- before fry realizes she can see
     his face.

                              fry
               there's light in here.

     it's a soft glow from above. imam climbs higher to discover
     small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. he plucks a few.

                              fry
               what are they?

     close on the lights in imam's palm. they writhe with life.

                              imam
               larva....

                              audrey
               glow worms....

                              fry
                         (mind racing)
               how many bottles we got? empty ones?
