     ext. planet - day

     trekking, the chrislams waft incense pots and chant from
     the koran as they head toward the blue star. johns provides
     shotgun escort; fry carries paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
     silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
     odd sight.

     already sun-battered, johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
     fry tries to wrap her head like the chrislams. imam helps.

                              fry
               so quiet. you get used to the sounds of
               the ship, then....

                              imam
               you know who muhammad was?

                              fry
               some prophet guy?

                              imam
               "some prophet guy." and a city man. but
               he had to travel to the desert -- where
               there was quiet -- to hear the words of
               god.

                              fry
               you were on a pilgrimage? to new mecca?

                              imam
                         (nodding)
               chrislam teaches that once in every
               lifetime should there be a great hajj --
               a great pilgrimage. to know god, better,
               yes, but to know yourself as well.

                              fry
               frightening thought.

                              imam
                         (finishes wrapping her)
               we're all on the same hajj now.

     fry notices johns scope-locked on something.

                              fry
               what?

                              johns
                         (hands her scope)
               tell me it's not a mirage.

     scope pov: beyond a distant rise, strange branches.

                              fry
               trees?
