     int. coring room - day

     now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
     over pilgrim #3 and...

     the ceiling rafters. they're encrusted with thick nests of...
     something. the skittering grows louder, more agitated.

     sensing trouble, pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
     a wall -- the breach he entered through. he never gets there:

     sunlight hits the first nest. it explodes with life.
