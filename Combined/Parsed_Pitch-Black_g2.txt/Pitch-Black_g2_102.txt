     ext. coring room - settlement - day

     hands digging in dirt.

     covertly, audrey and pilgrim #3 watch riddick digging near the
     entrance of a tall windowless structure.

     he excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
     and a child's tin robot, timeless. riddick thumbs a solar panel
     clean. the robot's language program warbles to life:

                              robot
               "...to all intruders. i am the guardian
               of this land. i will protect my masters
               at all cost. death to all intruders..."

     riddick stands and tries the doors. locked. he peers through a
     small filthy window. is there something moving inside? nothing
     now. riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
     "coring room."

                              johns (o.s.)
               missin' the party. c'mon.

     it's johns, keeping him on a short leash. leaving, riddick kicks
     a trash bin. hard.

                              riddick
               missin' the party. c'mon.

     he leaves. hold on the trash bin a beat.


                              audrey (o.s.)
               talkin' to me?
