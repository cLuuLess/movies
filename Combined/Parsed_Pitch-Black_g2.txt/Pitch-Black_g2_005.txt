     int. flight deck - day

     fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
     times, making mental errors. finally she gets crash-shutters
     open to reveal...

     cloud strata sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
     on a dropping elevator. we're shedding big altitude.
