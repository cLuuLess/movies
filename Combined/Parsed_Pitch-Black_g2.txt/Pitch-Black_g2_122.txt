     int. skiff - day

     the hatch closes, seals.

     close on a monitor. a "hull integrity test" is underway. fry
     scans rising pressure gauges.

                              riddick (o.s.)
               looks like we're a few shy....

     fry whirls. riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
     bay. and he has imam's blade.

                              riddick (cont'd)
               power cells.

                              fry
               they're coming.

                              riddick
               strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
               drive yet.
                         (half-beat)
               strange unless he told you the particulars
               of my escape.

                              fry
               i got the quick-and-ugly version.

                              riddick
               an' now you're worried about a repeat of
               history?

                              fry
               entered our minds.

                              riddick
               i asked what you thought.

                              fry
               you scare me, riddick. that's what you
               wanna hear, isn't it? there, i admit it,
               can i get back to work now?

     she finds the courage to turn her back on him. riddick moves
     closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. the cabin
     pressure builds.

                              riddick
               think johns is an do-right man? you
               think i can trust him to cut me loose?

     a beat. does riddick already know? is he testing her?

                              fry
               why, what'd you hear?

                              riddick
               well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
               just do me, huh? then again...i am worth
               twice as much alive.
                         (reading her face)
               didn't know? johns ain't a cop. oh, he's
               got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
               he's just a merc and i'm just a payday.
               that's why he won't kill me. the creed is
               greed.

     it knocks her off stride, but...

                              fry
               save it, riddick. we aren't gonna turn on
               each other -- no matter how hard you try.

     riddick moves right up behind her.

                              riddick
               i don't truly know what's gonna happen
               when the lights go out, carolyn -- but i
               do know that once the dyin' starts, this
               little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
               itself apart. so you better find out the
               truth. come nightfall, you better know
               exactly who's standing behind you.

     a monitor chirps the news: "hull integrity --100%." exhaling
     gasses, the hatch opens automatically.

                              riddick
               oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. and ask
               why your crew-pal had to scream like that
               'fore he died.
