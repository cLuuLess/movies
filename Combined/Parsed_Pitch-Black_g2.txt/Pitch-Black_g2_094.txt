     ext. planet - day

     extremely wide: blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
     the survivors trek for the settlement. fry and imam lug the
     power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...

     riddick. promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
     he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.

                              paris
                         (to johns)
               so just like that. wave your little wand
               and he's one of us now.

                              johns
               didn't say that. but least this way i
               don't have to worry about falling asleep
               and not wakin' up.

                              imam
               well, i feel we owe mr. riddick amends.

                              shazza
               oh, right. let's all line up and beg his
               forgiveness. right you are.

                              imam
               at least give the man some oxygen....

                              johns
               he's happy just bein' vertical. leave him
               be.

                              audrey
               so i can talk to him now?

                              johns/shazza
                         (in unison)
               no.

     paris drops a wine bottle. trailing, riddick collects it.

                              paris
               paris p. ogilvie. antiquities dealer,
               entrepreneur.

                              riddick
                         (shaking hands)
               richard b. riddick. escaped convict,
               murderer.

     instead of returning the bottle, riddick opens it and drinks.
     paris hurries to catch up to the others.

                              paris
               you know, if i owned hell and this
               planet...i believe i'd rent this out and
               live in hell.
