     ext. ribcage - the gauntlet - day

     the scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. lined with rib
     bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.

     fry squints at the ridgetops. more of those spires are visible
     on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "what are
     they? just mineral deposits?"

     the chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
     leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
     arabic discussion. desert fruit? is it edible?

                              fry
               wait, wait, wait....

     fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
     core. they all stare. it's a baseball.

               we are not alone here, yes?

     they look ahead, wondering what awaits them. but johns is
     looking back.

                              johns
               never thought we were.
