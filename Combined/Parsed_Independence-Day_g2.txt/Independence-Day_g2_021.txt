	alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the
	angry farmers, lucas, who marches over.  miguel edges her out
	of the doorway, wanting to handle this himself.

				miguel
		morning, lucas.

	lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

				lucas
		you like these!  i've got a whole
		goddamned crop full!

	unceremoniously, he dumps them at miguel's feet.

				lucas (cont'd)
		where the hell is your father?
		you know what time it is?

				miguel
		he had to re-fuel.  there musta
		been a problem.

				lucas
		we both know what the problem is.
		he's a damned nut case, is what he
		is.  i musta been out of my mind.

	troy smacks the television again.

				miguel
		troy, stop it!  i swear to god!

				lucas
		miguel, if he's not in the air in
		twenty minutes, that's it.  i'm
		getting someone else.

	lucas storms away.  again, troy whacks at the television.

				miguel
		stop it, troy!  i swear to god!

	determined, troy hits the television again.  this time the
	picture goes out completely.
