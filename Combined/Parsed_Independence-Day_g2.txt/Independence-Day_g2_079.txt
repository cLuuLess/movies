	int. jasmine's house - day

	steve, wearing his marine flight officer uniform, shoves the
	last of his things into his duffel bag.  we notice there are
	small figurines of dolphins everywhere.  jasmine hovers
	nervously behind him.

				jasmine
		you can't go.  call them back.

				steve
		baby, you know how it is.  i have
		to report to el toro right away.

				jasmine
		you said you were on leave for the
		fourth.

				steve
		they cancelled it.  why are you
		acting like this?

	jasmine grabs the blinds and yanks them away.  we see the
	alien craft through the window.

				jasmine
		why?  that's why.  that thing
		scares the piss out of me.
