	comes rushing in.

				sailor #1
		we have a total radar black out
		over a thirteen kilometer area.

	the lieutenant moves over to the main radar screen.  the
	entire upper portion of the screen is blank.  and the blank
	area is moving.

				lieutenant
		have a complete diagnostic run...

				sailor #1
		excuse me sir, radar may be
		malfunctioning but infrared is off
		the map!

	he diverts the lieutenant's attention to another screen; a
	bright sea of red light bleeds off the map.
