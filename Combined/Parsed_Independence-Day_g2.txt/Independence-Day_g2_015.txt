	ext. cliffside park - new jersey - morning

	with the new york skyline across the hudson behind them, old
	men sit in this small park playing chess.  unlike the others,
	david martin is in his early thirties, sixties hippie meets
	nineties yuppie nerd.

	he concentrates intensely on his next move.  moishe. sixties.
	smokes a cigar impatiently.

				moishe
		what are you waiting?  my social
		security will expire, you'll still
		be sitting there.

				david
		i'm thinking.

				moishe
		so think already.

	david makes a move.  instantly moishe counters his move.
	david furls his brow in thought.

				moishe
		again he's thinking.

	moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
	styrofoam cup.

				david
		you have any idea how long it
		takes for those things to
		decompose?

				moishe
		you don't move soon.  i'll begin to
		decompose.

	just as david finally makes his move, moishe counters again.
	david shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

				moishe (cont'd)
		david, i've been meaning to talk
		with you.  it's nice you've been
		spending so much time with me,
		but...

				david
		dad, don't start.

				moishe
		i'm only saying, it's been what?
		four years, you still haven't
		signed your divorce papers.

				david
		three years.

				moishe
		three, four.  move on.  it's not
		healthy.

	moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

				david
		look who's talking healthy.

	suddenly david's beeper goes off.

				moishe
		how many times is that now?  you
		trying to get fired?

	david moves his queen.

				david
		checkmate.  see you tomorrow, dad.

	he gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

				moishe
		that's not checkmate i can
		still... oh.
			(yelling after him)
		you could let an old man win once
		in a while, it wouldn't kill you.
