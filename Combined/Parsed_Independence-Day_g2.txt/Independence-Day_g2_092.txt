	int. locker room - el toro marine corps station - night

	a crowded locker room.  steve enters.
  
				male voice (o.s.)
		where the hell've you been?

				steve
		ah, were you guys waiting for me?

	several marines throws towels at steve as he makes his way to
	his locker.  his best friend, jimmy, sits next to him.

				jimmy
		can you believe it?  this is
		serious shit, stevie.  they've
		recalled everyone!

	as steve sits he sees some envelops stuck into the side of his
	locker.

				steve
		well, the mail's still working.

	he flips through the envelops and freezes when he sees one
	with the nasa insignia on it.  jimmy snatches it away from
	him.

				jimmy
		junk mail.  you don't want this.

	steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads.  from
	the disappointment on his face we can tell it's bad news.
	realizing, jimmy puts a hand on steve's shoulder.

				jimmy
		i don't believe it.  they make you
		learn how to fly everything from
		an apache to a harrier and still
		they turn you down?  what else do
		they want you to learn?

				steve
		how to kiss ass.

	steve crumples at the letter and tosses it.  angrily he opens his
	locker.  pasted on the locker door we see photos of jasmine
	next to the photos of the space shuttle, apollo missions, and a
	nasa insignia bumper sticker.

	as steve stuffs his jacket into the locker, something falls
	out.  before steve can grab it, jimmy snatches it up first.

				jimmy
			(embarrassed)
		jasmine has this thing for
		dolphins.  i had them make it...

				steve
		i thought you said you were doing
		to break it off.

	steve snatches it back, embarrassed.

				jimmy (cont'd)
		steve, listen to me, you're never
		gonna get to fly the space shuttle
		if you marry a stripper.

	steve knows he's right.  he's torn.
