	ext. rooftop - compact cable - same

	large satellite dishes beset a doorway to the roof which flies
	open.  david steps out just as a long, dark shadow covers over
	him, sending the city into darkness.  david looks up to see...

	skyline and alien craft

	protruding through the dark clouds we get a glimpse of the
	underbelly of a colossal alien craft, its outer veneer of
	smoke and clouds beginning to fade away.

	below we see panic, cabs slamming into one another, people
	staring, people screaming.  no one knows how to react.

	david runs to the other side of the rooftop, overlooking
	central park, to get a better look.

	david's pov - central park - same

	the entire park is plunged into darkness as the craft above
	blots out of the sun.  amazing as it may seem, the hovering craft
	blankets the entire park and beyond.  we still have not seen
	an entire craft.
