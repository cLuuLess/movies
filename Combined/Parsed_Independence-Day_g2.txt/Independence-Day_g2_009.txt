	feverishly through the night.  the officers cross the room.

	super: space command - the pentagon

				commanding officer
		satellite reception has been
		impaired but we were able to get
		these.

	they arrive at a glass table.  the surrounding officers snap
	to attention as a second officer quickly brings over a large
	transparency.  we see a grainy image of a large vague object.

				general grey
		looks like a big turd.

	the two officers exchange a glance.

				commanding officer
		we estimate it has a diameter of
		over five hundred and fifty
		kilometers and a mass roughly one
		fourth the size of our moon.

	the general turns to the second officer, concerned.

				general grey
		a meteor?

				second officer
		no sir.  definitely not.

				general grey
		how do you know?

				second officer
		well, er... it's slowing down.

				general grey
		it's doing what?

				second officer
		it's... slowing down, sir.

	the general walks over to a phone, picks it up.

				general grey
		get me the secretary of defense.
			(pause)
		then wake him up.
