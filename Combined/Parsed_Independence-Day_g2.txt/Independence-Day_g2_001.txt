	ext. lunar surface - the moon

	one small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
	kind.  untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
	castoff remains of the apollo mission.  slowly the discarded
	equipment begins to rattle and shake.

	an enormous shadow creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
	a loud rumble is heard.

	suddenly we are covered in darkness as the shadow engulfs us.
	only the lonely image of our earth hangs in the air, until a
	huge silhouetted object suddenly blocks our view.
