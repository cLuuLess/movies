	int. marty's office - continuous

	marty stares at his television watching general grey
	addressing the press.  david enters, staring at his reading.

				david
		i've got a lock on the signal
		pattern.  we can filter it out.

				marty
			(distracted)
		huh?  oh, good, hood.

				david
		strange thing is, if my
		calculations are right it'll be
		gone in approximately seven hours
		anyway.  the signal reduces itself
		every time it recycles.
		eventually it will disappear.  are
		you listening?

				marty
			(still glued to t.v.)
		can you believe this?

				david
		what re you talking about?

				marty
		haven't you been watching?

	david turns for the first time to the television and sees the
	phenomenon.  constance comes on addressing the press.

				constance
			(filtered)
		...so far the phenomenon has not
		caused any damage.  in all
		likelihood it won't...
