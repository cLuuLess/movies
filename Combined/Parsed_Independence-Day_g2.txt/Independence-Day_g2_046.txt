	int. airport diner - late morning

	depressed russell nurses a beer at the counter.  three flight
	mechanics walk in, having a good laugh.  one of them spots
	russell and moves over to him.

				mechanic #1
		hey, russ, heard you had a little
		trouble this morning.  dusted the
		wrong field?

	the mechanics laugh.  russell tries to ignore them.

				mechanic #2
		i know, you're probably still a
		little confused from your hostage
		experience.

				mechanic #2
		hostage experience?  something
		happen to you, russ?

				mechanic #1
		he ain't never told you!?  seems
		years back our boy here had been
		kidnapped by aliens.  did all
		kinds of experiments on him and
		such.  tell him, russ.

				russell
		not today, guys.  okay.

	russell gets up and heads for the door.

				mechanic #1
		you just gotta get a couple more
		beers in him, he'll tell you all
		about it.  crazy stuff.  won't
		you, russ?
