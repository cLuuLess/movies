	ext. iraqi desert - refugee camp - night

	a tent city.  ubiquitous overcrowding and poverty.  several
	hundred refugees settle down for the night.

	super: northern desert, iraq

	a bedouin stokes a small fire besides his family's tent.
	suddenly a group of shouting screaming tribes people come
	rushing past him.

	the bedouin watches them with confusion.  overcome with
	curiosity he goes against the tide of people, up the hillside.

	as the bedouin reaches the top of the hillside, his mouth
	falls open, aghast as he sees...

	the skies - the phenomenon

	creeping from across the horizon above the rocky mountain
	terrain, a wide fireball high in the sky, flaring and
	exploding.  a terrifying sight.
