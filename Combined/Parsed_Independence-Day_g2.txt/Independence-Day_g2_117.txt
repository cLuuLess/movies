	the police helicopter is still flashing their lights at the
	ufo believers who refuse to budge.  suddenly the entire
	rooftop is bathed in white light.  they all grow silent
	staring up at the craft.

	above them another schism has opened at the bottom of the
	craft, the white light spilling out.

	as though the heavens had opened, the ufo believers lift their
	arms, waiting to be taken.

				believers
		take me!  no, take me!  take me!

	slowly, this beam of light from the base of the ship
	intensifies directly on the top of this building.
