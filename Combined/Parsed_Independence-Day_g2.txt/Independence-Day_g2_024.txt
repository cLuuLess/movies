	int. oval office - wide shot - same

	the president, general grey, the secretary of defense and
	white house chief of staff albert nimziki are gathered around
	the couch.

				sec. of defense
		at the moment, our satellites are
		somewhat unreliable.  isn't it
		possible that thing may just pass
		us by?

				nimziki
		what if it doesn't &quot;pass us by?&quot;
		let's retarget some icbms to blow
		it out of the sky...

				general grey
		forgive me, but with the little
		information we do have, the only
		thing that would accomplish is
		turn one dangerous falling object
		into many.

	just then the door opens and constance enters.

				president whitmore
		what's the damage?

				constance
		the press is making up their own
		stories at this point.

				nimziki
			(to general grey)
		get on the horn with atlantic
		command.  let's upgrade the
		situation to defcon 3.

				general grey
		that's not your call to make, mr.
		nimziki.

				constance
		isn't that a little premature?

				nimziki
		i don't think so.

				sec of defense
		we're two days away from the fourth 
		of july.  we have over fifty percent 
		of our armed forces on weekend leave, 
		not to mention the troops and 
		commanders we	have in town for the 
		fourth of july	parade.  we call them 
		back now, we're sending up a major red 
		flag.

	they go quiet as commanding officer from space command dashes
	into the room.

				commanding officer
		our intelligence tells us the
		object has settled into a
		stationary orbit.

				nimziki
		well that's good news.

				commanding officer
		not really.

	he lays out the diagrams and photos on the table.  everyone
	gathers around.

				commanding officer
		part of it has broken off into
		nearly three dozen other pieces.

				president whitmore
		pieces?

				commanding officer
		smaller than the whole, yet over
		fifteen miles in width themselves.

				nimziki
		where are they heading?

				commanding officer
		they should be entering our
		atmosphere within the next twenty-
		five minutes.

	the room is silenced.  all eyes turn to the president who says
	nothing.  nimziki leans in close to him.

				nimziki
		like it or not, we're at defcon 3.
		recall the troops and put them on
		yellow alert.

							cut to:

	yellow lights flashing on

	as an alarm quickly buzzes. david leans into frame and opens
	the door to the microwave.  we widen to reveal...
