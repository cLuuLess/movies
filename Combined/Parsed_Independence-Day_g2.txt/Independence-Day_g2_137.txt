	int. air force one - same

	the president is deeply contemplative.  constance sits down
	next to him.  she knows what he's thinking.

				constance
		you saved a lot of lives.

				president
		i could have evacuated the cities
		hours ago.
			(beat)
		you know, when i flew in the gulf
		war everything is simple.  we
		knew what we had to do.  it's not
		simple anymore, connie.  a lot of
		people died today.  how many
		didn't have to?

	constance realizes there's no comforting him.  she supports
	him silently by being there.  general grey comes over.

				president
		any news on my wife?

				general grey
		the helicopter never arrived at
		nellis and there's been no radio
		contact.

	the news rocks the president.  they both know what that means.

				general grey (cont'd)
		the fighters are in the air.

	whitmore nods and follows the general to the back of the
	plane.

	command center - air force one

	military command has been set up on air force one, a kind of
	flying norad.  military and technical crew are seated at the
	controls.  nimziki is already there.

				general grey
		all satellites, microwave and
		ground communications with the
		cities are gone.  we believe we're
		looking at a total loss.

	maintaining his composure, the president looks up at the many
	tracking screens.

				president
		where are they?

				general grey
			(pointing)
		eta with target; four minutes.
