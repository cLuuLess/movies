	int. air force one - same

	back in the passenger section, the president sits with general
	grey and chief of staff nimziki.  the technician from the
	command module is briefing them.

				technician
		they must be targeting our
		satellites.  we've lost all
		satellite communication, tracking
		and mapping.

				general grey
		have norad relay intelligence to
		our on board computers?

	the technician nods and exits.  defeated, the president slumps
	sullenly.

				general grey
		we've moved as many of our forces
		away from the bases as possible
		but we've already sustained heavy
		losses.

	the president nods his approval absently.  coming out of the
	bathroom, david overhears.

				nimziki
		i spoke with the joint chief when
		they arrived at norad.  they
		agree, we must launch a counter
		offensive with a full nuclear
		strike.  hit 'em with everything
		we've got.

				president
		above american soil?

				nimziki
		if we don't strike soon, there may
		not be much of an america left to
		defend.

	the technician returns, his face is white with fear.

				general grey
		what's the latest from norad?

				officer
		it's gone, sir.  they've taken out
		norad.

				nimziki
		that's impossible...

				general grey
		my god, the vice president and the 
		joint chiefs...

				nimziki
		mr. president, we must launch.  a
		delay now would be more costly
		than when you waited to evacuate
		the cities!

	that stings the president.  he considers the option.  david is
	shocked.

				david
		you can't be seriously considering
		firing nuclear weapons?

				constance
		david, don't...

	david pushes past her.

				david
		if you fire nukes, so will the
		rest of the world.  do you know
		what that kind of fall out will
		do?  how many innocent people...

	the general gets up running interference.  constance tries to
	pull david back.

				general grey
			(stern)
		sir, i remind you that you are
		just a guest here...

				constance
			(overlapping)
		david, please...

				david
		this is insanity!  you'll kill us
		and them at the same time.
		there'll be nothing left!

				nimziki
			(interrupting)
		sit down and shut up!

	suddenly moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

				moishe
		don't tell him to shut up!  you'd
		all be dead, were it not for my
		david.  you didn't do anything to
		prevent this!

	as everyone is about to besiege moishe, the president tries to
	calm him down.

				president
		sir, there wasn't much more we
		could have done.  we were totally
		unprepared for this.

				moishe
		don't give me unprepared!  since
		nineteen fifty whatever you guys
		have had that space ship, the
		thing you found in new mexico.

				david
			(embarrassed)
		dad, please...

				moishe
		what was it, roswell?  you had the
		space ship, the bodies, everything
		locked up in a bunker, the what is
		it, area fifty one.  that's it!
		area fifty one.  you knew and you
		didn't do nothing!

	for the first time in along time, president whitmore smiles.

				president
		regardless of what the tabloids
		have said, there were never any
		space crafts recovered by the
		government.  take my word for it,
		there is no area 51 and no
		recovered space ship.

	chief of staff nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

				nimziki
		uh, excuse me, mr. president, but
		that's not entirely accurate.

	the president and general grey turn to nimziki, shocked.

	smashed and burned out cars

	laying across the roadway.  suddenly smash, jasmine's
	maintenance truck blasts through.
