		i have a confession to make.

		you didn't let her stay up
		watching t.v. all night?

				whitmore
		of course not.

	the little girl stirs awake, looks up.

				patricia
		mommy?

				whitmore
		you're flying back right after the
		luncheon?  okay, here she is.

	whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  habitably
	he turns on the television.

	t.v. - news program

	several &quot;pundits&quot; sit around a malaughlin-type news discussion
	program.  the picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

		... the inexperience in public
		office was inevitably going to
		catch up with him.  he's
		scarified his ideals for
		&quot;politics as usual.&quot;

	whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

				pundit #2
		...i said this during the
		campaign.  leadership as a pilot
		in the gulf war has no
		relationship to political
		leadership.  it's a different
		animal...

	suddenly the channel changes.  a cartoon comes on.  whitmore
	turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

				patricia
			(into phone)
		daddy let me watch letterman.

				whitmore
			traitor.

	whitmore exits the room.
