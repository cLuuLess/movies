	ext. jasmine's house - continuous

	steve picks up the morning paper and opens it.  he doesn't
	notice the dozens of neighbors quickly packing up and rushing
	to get away as he reads the paper oblivious.

				jasmine (o.s.)
		you want milk with your coffee?

	jasmine appears behind him, her view, too, obscured by the
	open newspaper.  suddenly another helicopter room overhead.
	annoyed, steve lowers his paper.

	steve and jasmine's pov

	as the paper is lowered we see the helicopter swoop down.  as
	it flies away we see...

	the alien craft

	covering all of los angeles.  this is the first time we see
	the entire craft.  it is stupendous.  steve's jaw hits the
	floor.  the milk goes crashing as jasmine screams.
