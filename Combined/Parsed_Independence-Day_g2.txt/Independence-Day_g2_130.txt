		...my god.  it's destroying
		everything in its path.

	suddenly the radio cuts out.  jasmine turns around and sees...

	jasmine's pov - freeway &amp; downtown

	far off the devastation of downtown can be seen.  the wall of
	destruction growing towards us.

	reacting, jasmine grabs dylan and dashes out of the car.
	boomer follows.  every drivers who can, jumps out of their
	cars, running in all directions.

	jasmine heads for the tunnel.

	angle - freeway

	the grid-locked cars have nowhere to run as the wall of
	destruction grows out from downtown.  all the cars are wiped
	out in a row, sitting ducks.

	angle - overpass - bridges

	packed with cars.  they're quickly demolished as the wall of
	destruction blasts by.
