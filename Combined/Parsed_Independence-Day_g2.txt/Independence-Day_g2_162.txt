	russell wipes down troy's forehead, he's burning up.  alicia
	brings over a cold compress.

				russell
		you know, you're just like your
		mother.  she was stubborn too.  i
		had to twist her arm to get her to
		take her medicine.

				troy
		i'm sorry, dad.
			(beat; scared)
		i'm not goin to die like mom, am
		i?

				alicia
		you're going to be fine.

	miguel comes rushing in, pulls russell aside.

				miguel
		i couldn't find anything.
		everyone is packing up, they're
		leaving.  word is a space ship is
		heading this way.

				russell
		we should leave too.

				miguel
		there's a group heading south,
		they said there's a hospital just
		a couple hours away.  i think we
		should follow them.

	russell nods in agreement.  a knock on the door.  alicia turns
	to find a handsome young boy, philip in the doorway holding a
	bottle of pills.

				philip
		penicillin.  at least it will help
		keep his fever down.

				alicia
		it's really nice of you to help
		us.

				philip
		i wish i could do more but we're
		moving out.

				alicia
			(too eager)
		we're going with you.  i mean,
		we're going too.

				philip
		cool.

	alicia nods, smitten.  philip smiles charmingly and leaves.
