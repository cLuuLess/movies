               ext. cargill's quarters - day

               the "men" have lined up in front of cargill's sad, sod hut; 
               pitiful men. sick, moth-eaten, crushed in spirit. there are 
               nine of them. just behind cargill is a half-collapsed supply 
               house and a broken down corral holding two bony horses.

               cargill has a brave face and a broken heart.

                         you hate me... but i feel none of 
                         the same for you... you men stayed. 
                         you stayed after they took all our 
                         horses. you stayed after all the 
                         others deserted. you stayed on the 
                         promise that the army would resupply 
                         us. i've looked for that wagon from 
                         fort hays just as you have... day 
                         after miserable day. all i can say 
                         is that i'm proud of you. get your 
                         things men, we're leaving this place. 
                         the army... can go to hell.

               the zombie troops have already broken ranks, lurching back 
               to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks.

               cargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down sign 
               that hangs askew above his quarters: "fort sedgewick."
