               ext. indian village - dawn

               it has stopped raining but the ground is still soaked and an 
               early morning fog is swirling through the camp. clumped in 
               groups of five or six, behind the lodges nearest the river, 
               are sioux warriors with rifles. they're absolutely quiet as 
               they wait for the enemy.

               dances with wolves looks across a clearing that slopes down 
               to the breaks fronting the river. nothing.

               wait. a movement. and another. another. the heads of men 
               lurking in the fog. he glances at the defenders.

               most of the warriors are huddled behind the line of lodges 
               watching him. ten bears raises a hand.

               the pawnee are visible now, a war party at its fiercest, 
               painted and feathered and armed to the teeth.

               coming on foot, the first of them have reached the edge of 
               the clearing. they start into a stealthy trot, more and more 
               of them breaking into a run.

               a pawnee war cry goes up and, as the others join in. ten 
               bears lowers his hand.
