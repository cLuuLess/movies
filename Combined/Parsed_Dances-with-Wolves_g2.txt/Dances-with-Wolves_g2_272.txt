               dances with wolves looks ready to crack.

                                     wind in his hair (o.s.)
                         can you not see that you will always 
                         be my friend?

               dances with wolves lets the unhappy echo of these words fade 
               away before he starts his pony again. we follow for a few 
               yards. then the call comes a second time. if anything, more 
               urgent than before.

                                     wind in his hair (o.s.)
                         dances with wolves...

               dances with wolves stops. he drops his head painfully as the 
               sound of his own name booms through his head.
