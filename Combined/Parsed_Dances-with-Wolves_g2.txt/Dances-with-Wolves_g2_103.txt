               dunbar is lying on his buffalo robe, his hand runs against 
               the grain of the thick fur. he begins writing in his journal.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         i believe i am dealing with kiowa 
                         indians as i have heard that word on 
                         several occasions.

               he rolls on his back, and lays aside the journal, practicing 
               the hand signals.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         i am learning the kiowa words for 
                         head, hand, horse, fire, coffee, 
                         buffalo, hello and goodbye.
