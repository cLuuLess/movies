               int. supply house - day

               dances with wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined 
               supply house. one side of his face is grotesquely swollen 
               from the blow he took. blood still seeps from a long split 
               of the skin along his cheek.

               he groans. voice are playing about his ears, the voices of 
               white men. he opens his eyes.

               a bearish, bearded sergeant bauer, is squatting directly in 
               front of him. behind the sergeant, peering over the crumbled 
               walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary 
               soldiers.

                                     bauer
                         spivey...

               a pitiful looking man, spivey, who is a soldier by name only, 
               answers up.

                                     spivey
                         yessir sergeant...

                                     sergeant bauer
                         tell the major he's wakin' up... and 
                         move your worthless ass.

               the sergeant's smallish eyes are fixed on dances with wolves. 
               with some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting 
               position against the back wall.

                                     sergeant bauer
                         got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't 
                         ya?

               dances with wolves only blinks at him. his cheek is crushed 
               and so is his spirit.

               someone calls attention and two officers walk into the 
               roofless supply house. one is a major, one is a young 
               lieutenant -- lieutenant elgin -- the officer dances with 
               wolves bumped into at fort hays. neither one recognizes the 
               other.

                                     major
                         does he speak english?

                                     sergeant bauer
                         don't know sir... you speak english? 
                         talk english?
                              (kicking at one of 
                              dances with wolves' 
                              boots)
                         talk?

                                     dances with wolves
                         i speak english...

               everyone is shocked at the clarity of the words.

                                     major
                         who are you?

                                     dances with wolves
                         lieutenant john. j. dunbar. this is 
                         my post.

                                     major
                         why are you dressed like this?

                                     dances with wolves
                         i came out from fort hays last april. 
                         but there was no one here.

               the major and the lieutenant exchange whispers.

                                     elgin
                         you have proof of that?

                                     dances with wolves
                         my journal is on the bunk in my 
                         quarters. my orders are in the 
                         journal. it will tell you everything.

                                     elgin
                         spivey, you and edwards were here 
                         first. did you find anything... a 
                         journal.

               spivey shifts uncomfortably.

                                     spivey
                         we didn't see nothin' sir.

                                     elgin
                         where's edwards?

                                     spivey
                         he's outside. but he didn't see 
                         nothin' either.

               elgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom 
               of this and walks out the door -- the major follows.

               dances with wolves lets his head slump forward. the men 
               gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves, 
               commenting on the prisoner. they can't take their eyes off 
               him. neither can sergeant bauer. he watches the prisoner 
               from a distance. then he walks across the floor, squats in 
               front of him and whispers coarsely in his face.

                                     sergeant bauer
                         you turned injun, din'cha?

               dances with wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant.

                                     sergeant bauer
                         din'cha?

               the major and the lieutenant suddenly reappear.

                                     elgin
                         what is your name?

                                     dances with wolves
                         dunbar... d.u.n.b.a.r... john.

                                     elgin
                         you say you are an officer?

                                     dances with wolves
                         did you read my orders?

                                     elgin
                         no.

                                     dances with wolves
                         it was in my journal.

                                     elgin
                         there are no orders and there is no 
                         journal.

               there is a silence as dances with wolves takes this in.

               elgin tries again.

                                     elgin
                         why are you out of uniform?

               dances with wolves takes a long time to answer.

                                     dances with wolves
                         i have to relieve myself.
