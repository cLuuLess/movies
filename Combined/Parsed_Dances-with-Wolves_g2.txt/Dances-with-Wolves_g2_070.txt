               ext. ten bears' lodge - day

               an old indian man sits in the shade outside his lodge. his 
               skin is leathery, his hair grey and wispy but his eyes are 
               bright as diamonds. he is ten bears, well past sixty, but 
               still strong enough to be the head man. he is, for the most 
               part, oblivious to the grandchild squirming in his lap.

               he's smoking a long-stemmed pipe, but the main object of his 
               interest is an old woman squatting next to him... pretty 
               shield. she's pounding away at something in a bowl.

               ten bears looks up to notice kicking bird. the medicine man 
               is passing not far away and ten bears' eyes follow him 
               carefully, not glancing away until kicking bird has ducked 
               into his lodge.

                                     ten bears
                         kicking bird has been keeping to 
                         himself these last few days. i do 
                         not like to see our medicine man 
                         walking so alone.

               the old woman looks up from her pounding but does not respond.

                                     ten bears
                         what does his wife say?

                                     pretty shield
                         he is keeping to himself.

               ten bears gives his wife a challenging look and she bristles.

                                     pretty shield
                         that's what she says.

               ten bears accepts this. then he looks down at the bowl.

                                     ten bears
                         make sure that meat is soft... my 
                         teeth hurt.

               ten bears looks once more at the entrance of kicking bird's 
               lodge.
