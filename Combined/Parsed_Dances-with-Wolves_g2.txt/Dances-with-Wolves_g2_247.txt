               ext. wagon - day

               dances with wolves snaps the loop around spivey's neck as 
               hard as he can and bone breaks.

               dances with wolves is beating spivey furiously with his 
               chains. he keeps whacking until the blood is spreading on 
               the surface of the water.

               the frantic driver is about to make a run for it when he is 
               impaled with a sioux lance.
