               int. ten bears' lodge - day

               the old man puffs away at his trusty pipe. now he lays it 
               down. kicking bird and dances with wolves are waiting 
               patiently.

                                     ten bears
                         it's hard to know what to do.

               the old man gets up, walks to his bedside, reaches up into 
               the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon-sized rawhide 
               bundle. he brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly. 
               inside is a rusted hunk of metal, the helmet of a spanish 
               conquistador.

                                     ten bears
                         the men who wore this came in the 
                         time of my grandfather's grandfather. 
                         eventually, we drove them out. then 
                         the mexicans came. in my own time 
                         the whites came... the texans. they 
                         have been like all the others who 
                         find something they want in our 
                         country. they take it without asking. 
                         i have always been a peaceful man, 
                         happy to be in my own country and 
                         wanting nothing from the white people. 
                         nothing at all. but i think you are 
                         right. i think they will keep coming. 
                         when i think of that, i look at this 
                         bundle. our country is all that we 
                         want. we will fight to keep it.

               he picks up his pipe and puffs deeply.

                                     ten bears
                         tomorrow morning we will strike the 
                         village and go to the winter camp.
