               int. kicking bird's lodge - night

               the medicine man's wife is already in bed as he slips under 
               the covers with a grunt.

                                     black shawl
                         how long will stands with a fist 
                         mourn?

               kicking bird gives his wife an odd look.

                                     kicking bird
                         i don't know.

                                     black shawl
                         i hope it will not be too long.

               kicking bird rises on his elbows.

                                     kicking bird
                         something has happened? well what?

                                     black shawl
                         she has found love again.

                                     kicking bird
                         with who?

                                     black shawl
                         dances with wolves.

                                     kicking bird
                         are you certain of this?

                                     black shawl
                         when you see them together you will 
                         know.

               kicking bird stares wearily across the floor.

                                     kicking bird
                         what are people saying? they're not 
                         angry?

                                     black shawl
                         no. they like the match. it makes 
                         sense. they are both white.

                                     kicking bird
                         i suppose i will be the one to say 
                         something.

               a brief silence.

                                     black shawl
                         she's your daughter now.

               kicking bird glances up frustrated with himself.

                                     black shawl
                         you can't see everything coming.
