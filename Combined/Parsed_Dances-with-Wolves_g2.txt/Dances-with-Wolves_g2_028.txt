               ext. campfire - night

               dunbar sits at the fire watching the star burn out.

               timmons is bending over the fire. he farts, then turns to 
               dunbar with a smile "good one, huh?".

               he spits for good measure and for dunbar, the moment is 
               broken, but not forgotten.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         were it not for my companion i believe 
                         i would be having the time of my 
                         life. he is quite possibly the foulest 
                         person i have ever met.

               looking over his shoulder at the journal, we see that this 
               latest entry is one of many and dunbar is embellishing it 
               with a drawing of a star.
