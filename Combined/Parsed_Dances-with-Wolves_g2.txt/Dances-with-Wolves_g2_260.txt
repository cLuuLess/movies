               int. ten bears' lodge - day

               several men are gathered around ten bears' fire, including 
               kicking bird, wind in his hair and dances with wolves.

               all the men are draped with blankets. the wind is howling 
               outside. the men are engaged in small talk as the pipe goes 
               around the circle.

               the pipe comes around to dances with wolves, and the man 
               next to him must nudge him to attention. dances with wolves 
               takes the pipe and begins to smoke.

               ten bears watches him closely.

                                     ten bears
                              (to dances with wolves)
                         dances with wolves is quiet these 
                         days.

               he does not reply. he smokes a little more and passes the 
               pipe.

                                     ten bears
                         is his heart bad?

               dances with wolves glances at the men around the fire.

                                     dances with wolves
                         killing the soldiers at the river 
                         was a good thing. it made me free 
                         and my heart was big to see my friends 
                         coming to help me. i did not mind 
                         killing those men. i was glad to do 
                         it.

               he searches for the right words.

                                     dances with wolves
                         but the soldiers hate me now like 
                         they hate no other. i am more than 
                         an enemy to them, i am a traitor. 
                         they will hunt for me. they will not 
                         give up. and when they find me they 
                         find you and that cannot happen.

               objections break out all around the fire. wind in his hair 
               jumps to his feet and even kicking bird is protesting.

                                     ten bears
                         quiet!... sit down wind in his hair. 
                         you are hurting an old man's ears 
                         with your loud talk.
