               wind in his hair is riding hard and happy. he really fixed 
               that white god. but as he clears the brow of a rise, a 
               riderless horse blows past him, running in the opposite 
               direction.

               cisco's running back, to the fort at full speed, the lines 
               of two ropes flying behind him.

               the big warrior's smile is gone. he wheels his pony and 
               charges over the rise, nearly colliding with another warrior 
               who has been in hot pursuit of cisco. the warrior pulls up 
               and looks helplessly at wind in his hair. but wind in his 
               hair's attention is focused on the rest of his party. the 
               three remaining warriors who rode with him are all on foot. 
               one is bending over a man lying unconscious on the ground. 
               the third is limping badly, trying to catch his horse.

               wind in his hair glances back in the direction of the fort, 
               but the buckskin is already gone.

               he starts down the incline to help his friends.
