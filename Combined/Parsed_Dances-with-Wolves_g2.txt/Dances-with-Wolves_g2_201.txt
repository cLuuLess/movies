               int. ten bears' lodge - dawn

               pretty shield stands in front of a group of children, ready 
               to defend them.

               the pawnee is inside now. he has a wild desperate look and 
               in a moment his hatchet will be flailing its way through 
               these people.

               but he never takes a step. instead he suddenly sinks to his 
               knees and we see another arrow join the one that is already 
               buried in his back. the warrior keels over and pretty shield 
               looks through the open flap to see the grinning face of stone 
               calf.

               without hesitation, pretty shield snatches a half-burned log 
               from the fire and finishes the pawnee.

               the children watch, their faces a mixture of horror and 
               intrigue.
