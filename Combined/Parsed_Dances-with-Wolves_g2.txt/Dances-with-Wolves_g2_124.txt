               ext. killing ground - day

               beneath droves of scavenging black birds lies the body of a 
               buffalo. his hide has been peeled off and his tongue has 
               been cut out. the rest of his body has been left to rot in 
               the sun.

               the column, so noisy and happy before, winds its way through 
               the killing ground in silence. there must be twenty-five 
               buffalo like the one we saw close up, all of them stripped 
               and rotting.

               dunbar looks queasy. the lieutenant glances at the medicine 
               man riding next to him. kicking bird looks sick too. dunbar 
               looks away. the entire column is stretched along the killing 
               ground, looking.

               a naked cow, covered with birds, lies on her side. her new 
               born calf, doomed to death, cries for his dead mother. and 
               next to the calf, dunbar sees something else. he sees wagon 
               tracks and the booted footprints of white men.
