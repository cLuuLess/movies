               ext. indian village - night

               the village is coming up. a great fire is blazing at the far 
               end. horse and rider speed past the first lodge.

               it's an important mission for the lieutenant. as he gallops 
               through the village, he says one word over and over, trying 
               to remember the correct pronunciation. it's the sioux word 
               for buffalo.
