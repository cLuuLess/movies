                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         they have come again, as always the 
                         same two with an escort of six.

               dunbar is standing in the same spot, it is a new day

               leaving their ever present escort behind, kicking bird and 
               wind in his hair ride into the fort.

               kicking bird's pony is carrying something large and bulky on 
               his withers. a buffalo robe. dunbar walks up to greet them. 
               kicking bird returns the welcome and signs to him as he 
               speaks.

                                     kicking bird
                         have you seen any buffalo?

               dunbar can only shake his head no.

               kicking bird accepts this and dismounts.

               dunbar throws his customary wave but the escort remains 
               noncommittal.
