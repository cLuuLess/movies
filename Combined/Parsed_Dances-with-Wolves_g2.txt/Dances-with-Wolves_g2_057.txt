               ext. sedgewick - dusk

               his long day has drawn to a close. dunbar sits on the stoop 
               of his quarters. his journal open in his lap. the sign over 
               the doorway has been straightened. dunbar is staring at 
               something.

               one hundred yards away, sitting in the grass is the outline 
               of a wolf.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         there is a wolf who seems intent on 
                         the goings on here. he does not seem 
                         inclined to be a nuisance however 
                         and aside from cisco has been my 
                         only company. he has appeared each 
                         afternoon for the past two days. he 
                         has milky white socks on both feet. 
                         if he comes calling tomorrow i will 
                         name him two socks.
