               ext. prairie - day

               the image of a boot fades in, pull back to see that a lone 
               rider is coming toward us. he has had a long and dusty trip. 
               it's lieutenant dunbar. he's still riding the little buckskin.

               legend - fort hays. kansas - 1863

               dunbar pulls up short. he stares thoughtfully at something 
               in the distance.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         the strangeness of this life cannot 
                         be measured. in trying to produce my 
                         own death, i was elevated to the 
                         status of a living hero.

               dunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to cover 
               his back. in the distance we can see an isolated and dreary 
               military post.

               the sky is very blue. the sun is bright. a rough-hewn, 
               unfenced fort is straight ahead.

               there are several miscellaneous stone structures, a well-
               stocked stable, barracks, officer's quarters and in the center 
               of it all, a headquarters building.

               lieutenant dunbar, riding straight and tall on his powerfully 
               built buckskin, cisco, passes into view. he's headed for the 
               center of the fort.
