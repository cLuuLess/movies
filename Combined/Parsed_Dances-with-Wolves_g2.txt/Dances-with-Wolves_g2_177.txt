               ext. fort - day

               the breeze is up and the remaining shreds of canvas that 
               were once the awning are flying like tattered flags.

               leading cisco, dances with wolves walks into view. it will 
               be his last visit to his old home and he is taking his time.

               he watches the blowing canvas. the sound of it snapping is 
               all that can be heard.

               he steps over to the supply house. he starts to peer in, but 
               when he places a hand against the sod, part of the wall gives 
               way.
