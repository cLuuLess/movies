               ext. winter camp - day

               stands with a fist sits on a pony outside the lodge. two 
               pack horses are loaded with their things.

               dances with wolves swings onto his pony's back and we follow 
               as they start out of the village. no one is standing in rose 
               to watch them leave. no one is crying. in fact, people are 
               making the motions of going about their regular work.

               but it's all fake too. the whole village is sad and the most 
               obvious sign is that there is no sound. in the awful quiet, 
               most people avert their eyes as the two pass by.
