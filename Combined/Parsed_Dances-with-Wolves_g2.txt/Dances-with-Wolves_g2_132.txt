               ext. prairie - dawn

               a huddled body lies covered by the army issue blanket. a 
               moccasined foot comes into view and prods the blanketed shape. 
               lieutenant dunbar's waking face pops out of the blanket.

               standing over him is wind in his hair, stripped of all but 
               his breechclout. the barrel of his rifle is hanging downward, 
               swaying in front of the lieutenant's face.

               it is occurring to the lieutenant that his time may have run 
               out.

               the warrior swings his rifle into a shooting position, sights 
               after some imaginary game and imitates the rifle's recoil.

               he stares down at dunbar with a smile, lifts his rifle 
               overhead and barks out a cry of victory.
