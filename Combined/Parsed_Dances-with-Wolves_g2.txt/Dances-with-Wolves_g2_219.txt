               ext. indian village - day

               the lodge flap is still closed. but now it is covered in 
               sunshine.

               smiles a lot, worm and otter are just across the way, bundled 
               now against the chill of oncoming winter. they're watching 
               too. smiles a lot is standing next to worm, -- otter is on 
               his haunches. both are gnawing at a breakfast of dried meat 
               as they talk nonchalantly.

                                     worm
                         dances with wolves' door is closed 
                         alot these days.

                                     smiles a lot
                         they're trying to make a baby.

               the two older boys look down at otter.

                                     otter
                         i know that.

                                     smiles a lot
                         you would think they could have made 
                         a baby by now.

                                     worm
                         maybe they're having a hard time. 
                         some people have a hard time.

                                     smiles a lot
                         i don't think they're having a hard 
                         time.

                                     otter
                         me neither.

               a silence as the boys watch smoke curl out of the lodge. 
               worm laughs to himself.

                                     otter
                         maybe we should pull the smoke flap 
                         closed. then they would come out.

               the boys look at each other for the first time, their eyes 
               brightening. what a great idea!

               the two boys are stalking toward dances with wolves' lodge 
               when they see something that makes them peel off in another 
               direction.

               it's kicking bird, coming to call.

                                     kicking bird
                         dances with wolves, are you in there?

               in a moment the lodge flap opens and dances with wolves steps 
               outside. he's fully dressed but a little disheveled.

                                     kicking bird
                         i am riding today to a far away place. 
                         it is a place i haven't seen for a 
                         long time. a sacred place. i would 
                         like you to come with me.

               dances with wolves ponders this.
