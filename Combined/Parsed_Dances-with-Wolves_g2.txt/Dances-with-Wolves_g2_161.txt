               ext. village - day

               kicking bird and dunbar are strolling through camp engaged 
               in a real conversation, stands with a fist is just behind 
               them.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         i try to answer all of kicking bird's 
                         questions but i know he is frustrated 
                         with me. he always wants to know how 
                         many more white people are coming. i 
                         tell him that it is impossible for 
                         me to say. when he persists i tell 
                         him that the white people will most 
                         likely pass through this country and 
                         nothing more.

               kicking bird and stands with a fist are walking away from 
               dunbar, who takes a few steps in the opposite direction before 
               pausing. toward the end of the following speech he glances 
               back at them and stands with a fist glances back at him.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         but i am speaking to him in half-
                         truths. one day there will be too 
                         many, but i cannot bring myself to 
                         tell him that. i am sure that stands 
                         with a fist knows.
