               ext. prairie - day

               lieutenant dunbar has ridden deep into the prairie. watching 
               the sky, he takes a drink out of his canteen. the lieutenant 
               hears something, he turns cisco in that direction. he listens 
               harder. a weird sort of singing. warily he goes ahead.
