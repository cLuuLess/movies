               ext. prairie - day

               kicking bird and dances with wolves are alone on a great sea 
               of prairie.

               there's a little fire going. a sage hen is being roasted, 
               but for some time we hear nothing but the light crackle of 
               the fire. each man is preoccupied with his own thoughts, 
               thoughts of the broken forest.

                                     dances with wolves
                         you have asked me many times about 
                         the white people... you always ask 
                         how many more are coming.

               dances with wolves looks at his friend and mentor.

                                     dances with wolves
                         there will be a lot my friend... 
                         more than can be counted.

                                     kicking bird
                         help me to know how many.

                                     dances with wolves
                         like the stars.

               this is what kicking bird wanted to know. and it hits him 
               like a rock.

               kicking bird bows his head in thought while dances with wolves 
               raises his. he never wanted to say this, he wishes it wasn't 
               true.

                                     dances with wolves
                         it makes me afraid for all the sioux.
