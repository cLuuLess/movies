               six sioux warriors, the escort, are sitting atop their ponies 
               high on the ridge.

               dunbar buttons his tunic and casts a quick, backward glance 
               at the quarters. a rifle is standing near the door.

               dunbar decides not to go after it. he straightens his bearings 
               and he watches the approaching riders. it's only two -- wind 
               in his hair and kicking bird. the lieutenant bows at the 
               waist.

                                     dunbar
                         welcome...
                              (gesturing at them)
                         come... please... sit down.

               the two men slide off their ponies. dunbar throws an 
               unreturned wave to the escort warriors.

               there is a moment or two of silence.

                                     dunbar
                         would you like some coffee? coffee?

               there is no response.

                                     dunbar
                         i'll get some cups.

               dunbar disappears inside his quarters.
