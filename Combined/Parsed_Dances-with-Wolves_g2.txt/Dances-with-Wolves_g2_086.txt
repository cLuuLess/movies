               int. quarters - night

               lieutenant dunbar has gotten a beautiful shine out of his 
               best boots. he's putting the finishing touches on one of the 
               toes.

               dunbar places the boot next to its mate and turns to inspect 
               a dress tunic laid out on the bunk. his open journal is lying 
               next to it. he picks at little pieces of lint and brushes at 
               the smudges.

                         since i arrived at this post i have 
                         been walking on eggs. it has become 
                         a bad habit and i am sick of it. 
                         tomorrow morning i will ride out to 
                         the indians. i do not know the outcome 
                         or the wisdom of this thinking. but 
                         i have become a target and a target 
                         makes a poor impression. i am through 
                         waiting.
