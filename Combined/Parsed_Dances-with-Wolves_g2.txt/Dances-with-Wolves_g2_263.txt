               ext. winter camp - dawn

               from a little distance, wind in his hair is watching dances 
               with wolves' lodge. his face is full of uncertainty and a 
               kind of pain we have never seen before. he is in agony.

               he starts forward but after a few yards he stops to think. 
               he turns back but has only gone a few steps when he stops 
               and turns to face dances with wolves' lodge once more. he 
               starts for the tipi again, but he can't go thru with it. the 
               proud warrior turns away and walks quickly out of sight.
