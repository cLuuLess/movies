               int. quarters - day

               the person we see from the waist up bears little resemblance 
               to the lieutenant dunbar we've known.

               his long hair hides his face on his slightly bent head. his 
               skin is not so white anymore, and the great bone-pipe 
               breastplate covers his torso.

               dunbar starts to write and stops, he repeats this action. it 
               is clear that as lieutenant dunbar, he can find nothing to 
               say. he lays the pen down momentarily.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         made a long patrol today. there is 
                         nothing to report. the truth is i am 
                         bored.

               there is the scurry of movement and the scratch of tiny paws. 
               his eyes roam to the place in the corner where sacks of flour 
               and hard biscuits and other provisions are stored. watching 
               the sacks more closely, he sees that they are infested with 
               mice.

               restlessly, he walks to the doorway, gazing out onto the old 
               fort. the awning is beginning to tear at the corner. and 
               then he spots something.
