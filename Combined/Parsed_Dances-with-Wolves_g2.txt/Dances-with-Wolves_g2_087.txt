               ext. corral - day

               the buckskin's ears are pricked and his eyes are set. 
               something has his complete attention.

               the "something" is lieutenant john dunbar. he looks like a 
               recruiting poster: full dress uniform, red sash, saber 
               clanking at his side, hair tied in a neat pony tail, knee-
               length riding boots. and all of it is gleaming... from the 
               brass buttons to the gold epaulettes to the army issue belt 
               buckle.

               the red sash flutters and cisco shies to one side. dunbar 
               slaps at the sash, calms his horse and jumps on.

               we stop with them at the supply house. old glory is standing 
               against one of the crumbling walls. the flag has been affixed 
               to a long willow branch. dunbar sweeps it up and sticks the 
               staff into one of his boots.

               they start off at a jog, the flag popping in the stiff morning 
               breeze. just as they are getting small in the distance, two 
               socks comes into view.
