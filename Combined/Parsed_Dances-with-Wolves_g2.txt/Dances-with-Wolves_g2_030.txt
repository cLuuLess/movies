               ext. prairie - day

               a cluster of bones bleached white, are lying in the tall 
               grass. human bones. dunbar is squatting next to them. timmons' 
               head dips into view over his shoulder and the teamster's 
               mouth splits into a toothless grin.

                                     timmons
                         somebody back east is sayin'... "why 
                         don't he write?" stupid bastard.

               the teamster spits and starts for the wagon. dunbar comes to 
               his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon. then, 
               he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel. looking off he can 
               only guess at the drama here. the sun is sinking fast below 
               the great expanse of prairie.
