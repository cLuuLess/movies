               ext. prairie - day

               the war party with kicking bird and wind in his hair at its 
               head has halted in the middle of nowhere. the sioux riders 
               are coming toward them at a run. they pull up, excited with 
               what they have to tell.

               the returning war party and the two riders who met them start 
               ahead at a gallop.
