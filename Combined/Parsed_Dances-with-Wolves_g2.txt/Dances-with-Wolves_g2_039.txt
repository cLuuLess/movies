               ext. sedgewick - day

               a full view of the deserted fort. timmons sits on the wagon 
               by himself.

                                     timmons
                         ain't nothin' here lieutenant.

               dunbar appears from cargill's former quarters.

                                     timmons (o.s.)
                         everybody's run off... or got kilt.

               the lieutenant looks briefly at timmons, and marches over to 
               the caved-in supply house. again he ducks inside.

               dunbar emerges from the supply house and stares up at the 
               wagon driver.

                                     dunbar
                         alright...lets unload the wagon.

                                     timmons
                         what, and leave it all here?

                                     dunbar
                         i'm staying too... we don't know 
                         what's happened.

               dunbar moves around to the back of the wagon.

                                     timmons
                         there ain't nothin' here lieutenant.

                                     dunbar
                         not at the moment, no.

                                     timmons
                         so things bein' the way they are we 
                         might as well turn around and get 
                         started back.

                                     dunbar
                         this is my post...

                                     timmons
                         this is my... are you crazy boy?

               the lieutenant's eyes have gone absolutely black. the heel 
               of his hand is dropping lightly on the butt of a long revolver 
               at his hip.

                                     dunbar
                         this is my post! and these are the 
                         post's provisions. now get your ass 
                         off that wagon and help me unload.

               timmons leaps down.
