               ext. prairie - day

               a lone arrow remains in timmons' dead body, jutting out of 
               his privates.

               now the pawnee warriors pass by, heading for home in no 
               particular hurry. the toughest passes by with timmons' scalp 
               hanging from his bow. none of the men give timmons a parting 
               glance.
