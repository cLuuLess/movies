               int. kicking bird's lodge - day

               kicking bird's pipe is a beautiful piece of work. it's being 
               smoked.

               kicking bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to 
               dunbar. the lieutenant, aware that the pipe is something 
               special, handles it with care.

               he looks to kicking bird for guidance as he puts his mouth 
               to the tip. the medicine man reassures him with a wave of 
               the hand and dunbar begins to puff.

               dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes 
               well, watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff.

               he stops now and lowers the pipe. he stares down. the pipe 
               seems almost alive as it lays in his hands.

               dunbar hands the pipe back, and as kicking bird takes it he 
               hears the light tinkling of bells.

               dunbar hears it too. as he looks toward the sound, a shadow 
               falls across the arbor's entrance.

                                     kicking bird
                         we were waiting for you.

               stands with a fist ducks through the arbor's entrance and 
               seats herself between dunbar and kicking bird.

               stands with a fist is wearing a band of bells around one 
               ankle. she has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her 
               feet. her dress is old but well-cared for. animal teeth are 
               sewn along her bodice. on her wrist is a solid brass bracelet. 
               her hair is tied back loosely with a bret, accenting the 
               feminine in her face.

               her whiteness seems to show more than ever. but it is not 
               dominant. the sioux is dominant.

                                     kicking bird
                              (to dunbar)
                         welcome. it is good that you are 
                         here.

               kicking bird looks to stands with a fist. she takes her time 
               and the words are accented but they are close enough.

                                     stands with a fist
                         hullo. you here... good.

               the words are sweet music to the lieutenant. he replies with 
               a feeling of great relief.

                                     dunbar
                         thank you... i feel good.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (to kicking bird)
                         he thanks you. it is good.

                                     kicking bird
                         ask him why he is at the soldier 
                         fort.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (to dunbar)
                         uhh... you... come...

               dunbar jumps in. there are things he wants to know, has waited 
               a long time to know.

                                     dunbar
                         wait... what is your name?

                                     stands with a fist
                         our... names?

                                     kicking bird
                         what does he say?

                                     stands with a fist
                         he wants to know how we are called.

                                     kicking bird
                         ahhh... he's right. i'm sorry.

               the medicine man nods agreeably. he smiles at dunbar, quite 
               right, introductions should come first.

                                     stands with a fist
                         he... he... kick...

                                     dunbar
                         kick?

                                     stands with a fist
                         more.

               she kicks at the ground with the toe of her moccasin. dunbar 
               doesn't get it. she kicks a little harder.

                                     dunbar
                         kicking?

                                     stands with a fist
                         kicking... yes... kicking... bird.

                                     dunbar
                              (to kicking bird)
                         kicking bird...
                              (to stands with a 
                              fist)
                         what does he... is he a chief?

               stands with a fist has the word but it takes a few seconds 
               to make it come out of her mouth.

                                     stands with a fist
                         hul... hal... ho-lee... holy... holy 
                         man.

                                     dunbar
                         oh...
                              (glancing at kicking 
                              bird)

               a brief silence. kicking bird seems ready to speak but dunbar 
               is too quick.

                                     dunbar
                              (to stands with a 
                              fist)
                         your name... you.

               she thinks. it's hard. she smiles thinly.

                                     stands with a fist
                         i don't know.

               an idea comes to her. she stands up quickly.

                                     dunbar
                         up? get up?

                                     stands with a fist
                         no.

               she repeats the movement again.

                                     dunbar
                         stand.

               her smile is a little wider this time.

                                     stands with a fist
                         yes... stands.

               dunbar starts to speak but she cuts him off.

                                     stands with a fist
                         more...
                              (thinking)
                         wiff...
                              (quickly)
                         with.

               she draw something in the dirt. it's an "a".

                                     dunbar
                         stands with a...

               now she makes a fist and holds it close to dunbar's face.

                                     dunbar
                         fist?

               she nods.

                                     dunbar
                         stands with a fist. i'm john... john 
                         dunbar.

                                     stands with a fist
                         john dunbar.

                                     dunbar
                         yes.
