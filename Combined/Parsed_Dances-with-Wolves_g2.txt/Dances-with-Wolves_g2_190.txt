               ext. indian village - dawn

               in front of ten bears' lodge, dances with wolves is passing 
               out the last of the rifles. warriors are grabbing handfuls 
               of bullets out of an open ammo box.

               ten bears is watching this procedure. and while he watches, 
               he thinks.

               the guns have been passed out and, except for a slight murmur 
               among the warriors, it's strangely quiet. the band's best 
               fighters are gone and many men don't know what to do next. 
               they're looking to ten bears for leadership.

               but the old man is looking at dances with wolves. he holds 
               up a hand for quiet.

                                     ten bears
                         hear us now.
                              (to dances with wolves)
                         a white soldier with many far-shooting 
                         guns... how would he fight the pawnee?

               everyone is waiting.

                                     dances with wolves
                         i would hide in the village.

               the warriors send up a chorus of derisive cries but ten bears 
               angrily quiets them.

                                     ten bears
                         dances with wolves has not finished.

                                     dances with wolves
                         i would let the enemy think we are 
                         asleep... let him come close. then 
                         we would shoot together and run to 
                         fight them, drive them into the river 
                         and kill so many that they would 
                         never trouble us again.

               ten bears smiles.

                                     ten bears
                         i am of the same mind as dances with 
                         wolves... we should kill so many 
                         that they never trouble us again.
