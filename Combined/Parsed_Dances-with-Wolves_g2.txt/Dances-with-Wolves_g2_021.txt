               int. fort hays headquarters - day

               silhouetted against the outside, lieutenant dunbar pauses in 
               the wide doorway of headquarters. we can hear the distant 
               sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here 
               it's strangely quiet.

               a sergeant sits at a desk in the foyer. across the way, at 
               another desk, is an enlisted clerk. both men glance from 
               their paperwork at the man in the doorway. but it's only a 
               glance and they go right on shuffling paper.

               footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer with 
               slick, black hair swings into the foyer. he too has a 
               slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post.

               the blue-eyed officer, lieutenant elgin, and dunbar meet at 
               the doorway. dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his 
               hand.

                                     dunbar
                         where can i find major... fambrough?

                                     elgin
                         turn right... all the way to the end 
                         of the hall.

               being roughly the same age and rank these two might idle 
               awhile, but dunbar is eager. he's already moving.

                                     fambrough (o.s.)
                         lt. john j. dunbar.

                                     dunbar
                         sir?

               dunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. no one is 
               there.
