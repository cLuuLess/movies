               elgin and a soldier are leading the way. they're only a few 
               yards from the opposite bank when the lieutenant is taken. 
               elgin is completely surprised to find an arrow buried in his 
               chest.

               the outrider is about to pull up his gun when an arrow hits 
               him square in the gut. he brings his head up to see the full 
               force of wind in his hair, stringing up another arrow and 
               taking aim.

               just as the outrider is struggling to raise his gun, wind in 
               his hair fires off another arrow deep into the man's heart. 
               the impact sends him flying out of the saddle, dead.

               wind in his hair comes on, leading five sioux warriors.
