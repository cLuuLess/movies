               ext. prairie - day

               dunbar is on cisco. his big impression is gone. the uniform, 
               and his hands and face are smeared with stands with a fist's 
               blood. the girl is slung in front of him.

               his arms are holding her. her face is pressed against his 
               chest. they've come a good distance and are approaching a 
               smokey cloud.
