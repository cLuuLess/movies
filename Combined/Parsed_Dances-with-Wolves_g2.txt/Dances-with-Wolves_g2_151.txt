               ext. quarters - day

               a large prairie chicken is lying in front of the quarters. 
               dunbar squats next to it. it's neck carries punctures, and 
               when he dabs a finger on the wounds, he finds that the blood 
               is still wet. the lieutenant rises slowly, his sharp eyes 
               sweeping the fort.

               he's waiting patiently in his usual spot on the bluff 
               overlooking the river. two socks.

               dunbar smiles and shakes his head. watching his old friend, 
               he picks up the bird and begins to pluck with an ease that 
               suggests he's had some experience.
