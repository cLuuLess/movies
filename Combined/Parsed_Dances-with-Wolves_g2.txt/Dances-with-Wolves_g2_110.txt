               ext. river - day

               the big cry is over, but stands with a fist is still sniffling 
               as she emerges on a little patch of beach-next to the river. 
               she sits herself down under a cottonwood and looks hollowly 
               at the surface of the water in front of her.

               somewhere in the distance is the sound of many drums, with a 
               sigh she drops her head.

               then, as if shocked by some unseen force, her eyes spring 
               open. wide and unblinking, her eyes stare deeply into space.

               someone is calling. the voice is so faint at first that the 
               word can't be heard. but the calling grows and suddenly the 
               word is upon her.

                                     voice
                         christine...
