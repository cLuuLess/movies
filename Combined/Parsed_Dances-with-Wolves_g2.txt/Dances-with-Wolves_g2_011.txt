               ext. battlefield - day

               the lieutenant passes the last of the riflemen and pulls the 
               buckskin up at the far end of the field. the little horse is 
               pitching and rearing, ready for another run.

               the lieutenant bows his head in exhaustion, but a sound coming 
               across the field brings his head up quickly. a great cheer 
               is rolling along the union line.
