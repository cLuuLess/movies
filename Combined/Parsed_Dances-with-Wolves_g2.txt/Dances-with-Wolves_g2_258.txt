               find an orderly bringing coffee to a major. he is surrounded 
               by other officers and in front of him a large column of men 
               is moving toward the snow covered mountains.

               the major tosses the remaining coffee in a fire and he 
               prepares to mount.

               we pan up with the smoke and the steam.
