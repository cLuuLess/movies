               int. fambrough's office - day

               sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is major 
               fambrough.

                                     fambrough
                         lt. john j. dunbar.

               lt. dunbar is standing in front of the desk.

                                     dunbar
                         yes sir?

                                     fambrough
                         indian fighter, huh?

                                     dunbar
                         excuse me?

                                     fambrough
                              (indicating paper)
                         your orders say you are to be posted 
                         on the frontier. the frontier is 
                         indian country. i quickly deduced 
                         that you are an indian fighter.

               he arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. he has sad 
               swollen eyes. he is an army lifer passed over too many times 
               for promotion and right now does not look like a well man.

                                     fambrough
                         i did not ascend to this position by 
                         being stupid.

                                     dunbar
                         no sir.

               fambrough returns to the order. dunbar watches him in silence.

               the major's tunic is covered with food stains. sweat has 
               broken out all over his head. his grooming is awful. his 
               hands are trembling slightly. something is very wrong with 
               him.

               now the major sees something on the official paper. he looks 
               quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving 
               his lips but making no sound.

                                     fambrough
                         it says here you've been decorated.

                                     dunbar
                         yes sir.

                                     fambrough
                         and they sent you out here to be 
                         posted?

                                     dunbar
                         actually sir, i'm here at my own 
                         request... i want to see the frontier.

                                     fambrough
                         you want to see the frontier?

                                     dunbar
                         yes sir... before it's gone.

               the major fixes dunbar with a sly look.

                                     fambrough
                         such a smart lad coming straight to 
                         me.

               still sly, fambrough digs into a side drawer. there is the 
               distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. now fambrough 
               has what he wants, a blank official form. he begins to fill 
               it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way.

                                     fambrough
                         sir knight, i am sending you on a 
                         knight's errand. you will report to 
                         captain cargill at the furthermost 
                         outpost of the realm... fort 
                         sedgewick.

               he looks over his work with a schoolboy's excitement and 
               affixes his signature with a wild flourish.

                                     fambrough
                         my personal seal will assure you 
                         safe passage through many miles of 
                         wild hostile country.

               he folds the order and hands it to dunbar.

                                     dunbar
                         i'm wondering sir, how will i be 
                         getting there?

                                     fambrough
                         you think i don't know?

                                     dunbar
                         no sir, it's just that i don't know.

                                     fambrough
                         hold your tongue.

               the major turns in his chair to stare through a single, dusty 
               window. he can see a teamster outside, tying down canvas on 
               a heavily-loaded wagon.

                                     fambrough
                         i'm in a generous mood and will grant 
                         your boon. you see that peasant... 
                         he calls himself timmons... he leaves 
                         this very afternoon for your fort 
                         sedgewick. ride with him if you 
                         like... he knows the way. that is 
                         all.

               dunbar stands and salutes. fambrough returns it snappily.

               the lieutenant starts for the door.

                                     fambrough (o.s.)
                         sir knight...

               dunbar turns around. fambrough is standing in front of his 
               desk. there's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser 
               front.

               he jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and 
               giggles.

                                     fambrough
                         i just pissed in my pants... and 
                         nobody can do anything about it.
