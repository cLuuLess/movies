               ext. confederate wall - day

               there's action along the confederate line. the men dunbar 
               passed are desperately trying to reload. those at the end 
               are jeering, taunting the lieutenant to take another pass.

               tucker is moving along the line. the battle ground has 
               suddenly taken on a festival atmosphere and tucker doesn't 
               like it.

                                     confederate
                         come on you son of a bitch -- you 
                         won't make it a second time...
