               int. dances with wolves' lodge - dusk

               stands with a fist is building up the fire in their cozy 
               home. dances with wolves works on a long-stemmed pipe which 
               is in the last stages of completion.

                                     ten bears (o.s.)
                         dances with wolves?

               dances with wolves gets up, opens the flap and admits the 
               old chief. a few snowflakes cling to his wispy hair.

               he goes straight to the fire and sits.

                                     ten bears
                         ahh... this is a nice fire... at my 
                         age a good fire is better than 
                         anything.

               stands with a fist brings two small bowls of food, places 
               them next to the men and busies herself with something else. 
               though neither one is much interested they begin to eat.

                                     ten bears
                         i wondered how your bad heart was 
                         doing and though i would come by and 
                         see for myself. this place doesn't 
                         look so bad-hearted.

               dances with wolves smiles.

                                     dances with wolves
                         no, we are happy.

                                     ten bears
                         but you are leaving anyway?

                                     dances with wolves
                         i have talked with stands with a 
                         fist and we will go together.

                                     ten bears
                         have you told this to kicking bird 
                         or to wind in his hair.

               it's anguish for dances with wolves to think about his 
               friends. he shakes his head "no". ten bears thinks again in 
               silence.

                                     ten bears
                         you are the only white man i have 
                         ever known. i have thought about you 
                         alot. more than you know.

                                     dances with wolves
                         that does not surprise me.

                                     ten bears
                         you have always spoken with your 
                         heart. and like all of us, you are a 
                         free man and can do anything you 
                         like. when i look across this fire, 
                         i do not see a white soldier. i see 
                         only a sioux named dances with wolves. 
                         and there is nothing they hate so 
                         much as a sioux.

               ten bears words always have purpose and as always, he makes 
               his point.

               he pauses for a moment and notices dances with wolves' nearly 
               finished pipe.

                                     ten bears
                         you are making a pipe?

                                     dances with wolves
                         yes?

               ten bears holds out a hand and dances with wolves hands the 
               pipe to him. ten bears inspects it briefly.

                                     ten bears
                         this might be a pretty good pipe... 
                         how does it smoke?

                                     dances with wolves
                         i don't know, i haven't tried it 
                         yet.

                                     ten bears
                         let's smoke it awhile... it is good 
                         to pass the time this way.
