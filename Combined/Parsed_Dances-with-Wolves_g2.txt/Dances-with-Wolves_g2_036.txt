               ext. prairie - day

               from a high point on the prairie we can see the wagon moving 
               west. and no more than half a mile away we can see cargill's 
               column, moving east. neither is aware of the other's presence.

               several buzzards are settling on a half-butchered horse. 
               it's one of the animals that was with cargill's command. we 
               can hear men singing. the shaky little column from fort 
               sedgewick is marching east for fort hays.
