               int. hole - day (flashback)

               the first light streaks through the burrow entrance.

               christine is exerting herself mightily in an effort to move. 
               but she can't and again she begins to cry.

               more sounds from down below in the canyon. hoofbeats. and a 
               whinny or two. no way to tell whether this is friend or foe. 
               but she can't stay in the burrow.

                                     christine
                         help...

               she listens. the hoofbeats are gone.

                                     christine
                              (louder)
                         help me...
                              (screaming)
                         please... i need to get out.

               someone is coming up the slope.

               a moment later, hands are clawing at the walls of the burrow 
               and she is looking into three, surprised sioux faces. the 
               face in the center is recognizable. a younger kicking bird.
