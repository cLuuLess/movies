               ext. village - dawn

               through the smoke, dances with wolves can just catch a glimpse 
               of ten bears. he is moving through the village at a trot, 
               loading his gun.

               he spots a sioux warrior grappling with a pawnee, sights and 
               shoots the pawnee point blank. he trots off, reloading once 
               more.
