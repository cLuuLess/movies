               ext. indian camp - dusk

               several travois are parked in a clearing. it's a scene of 
               terrible woe. on the travois are dead bodies. women members 
               of several families are grieving as they collect the dead 
               men.

               some are shrieking, some are crying softly, and some are 
               beating themselves.

               one group is just beginning to hoist a body off its litter 
               when a strange looking woman appears in the clearing. she's 
               been running. her light, cherry-colored hair is tangled.

               her face is creased with pain and disbelief as she rushes 
               forward, crying out in sioux. she pushes through the other 
               women and tackles the body, taking it to the ground.

               she climbs atop the dead man, cradles his head against her 
               face and says a single word softly.

               it is his name and she whispers it again.

               of course there is no answer. with each saying of the name 
               she is more desperate, her voice growing louder and louder.

               she arches her back eerily and wails the name to the heavens 
               before flinging herself back at the lifeless face.

               at last the other mourners feel compelled to drag her away. 
               the little woman does not go easily.

               her name is stands with a fist.
