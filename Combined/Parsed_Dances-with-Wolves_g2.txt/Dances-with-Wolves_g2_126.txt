               ext. temporary camp - day

               while kicking bird's lodge rises behind her, stands with a 
               fist digs out a firepit. she looks up from her work.

               watching bashfully from several yards away is lieutenant 
               dunbar. now that she has seen him he starts forward, perhaps 
               to try some more talk.

                                     kicking bird (o.s.)
                         loo ten tant...

               dunbar turns to find kicking bird sitting on a pony just 
               behind him. two dozen mounted buffalo scouts are gathered 
               around him. kicking bird points at cisco, indicating that 
               dunbar should join them.

               tipping his hat to stands with a fist, dunbar hustles away 
               to his horse.

               stands with a fist faces the pit she's digging, not bothering 
               to look up as hoofbeats drum their way out of the temporary 
               camp. she seems to have lost herself in her own hands... the 
               hands that are digging out the soft prairie earth.

               there is crying but when stands with a fist looks up there 
               is just one of kicking bird's children standing there smiling 
               at her. she goes back to her digging.
