               dances with wolves is half-dozing against the wall when spivey 
               walks in with a plate of army gruel. he's followed by sergeant 
               bauer. spivey sets the plate in front of the prisoner. he 
               admires the breastplate and like a crow eyeing something 
               shiny, he thinks to grab for it.

               suddenly a pair of manacled hands lock on his wrists. dances 
               with wolves face is inches away from spiveys. terrified, 
               spivey pulls away, kicking over the plate of food as he 
               scrambles to safety across the room.

                                     sergeant bauer
                         lap it up injun.

               dances with wolves sticks a toe under the lip of the plate 
               and flips it over. most of it hits spivey, a little splashes 
               on bauer. spivey moves to kick the prisoner, but bauer 
               intercedes with his rifle.

                                     sergeant bauer
                         go on ahead injun... you'll just get 
                         hungrier is all... but mebbe that 
                         don't matter. word is they're gonna 
                         ship you back to hays. and they'll 
                         hang you once you get there.

               bauer and spivey leave him and dances with wolves kicks out 
               viciously at the spilled plate.
