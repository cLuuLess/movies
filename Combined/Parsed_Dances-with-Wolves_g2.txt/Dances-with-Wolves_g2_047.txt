               ext. corral - day

               dressed in pants, old boots, and a threadbare shirt, dunbar 
               bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate. he tests the 
               gate's swing and satisfied with this, he latches it leaving 
               cisco inside.

               the lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as he 
               walks the few, quick yards it takes to reach the bank 
               overlooking the river.

               when he sees what lies along the slope below, he stops. at 
               this spot just below the fort, a garbage dump falls away to 
               the stream. old containers, sacks, rags, trash, bottles, and 
               a thousand other miscellaneous scraps.

               dunbar hops over the steep lip of the bank and starts down 
               the gentle incline, eyeing the trash as he goes. now he 
               reaches the stream and kneels, preparing to dip the bucket.

               he sniffs a bad odor, looks across the stagnant stream and 
               sees something sticking out of the water.

               it's a cloven hoof. and further out, another. and part of an 
               antler. there are decomposed antelope corpses everywhere.
