               int. quarters - day

               it's storming outside. rain is pouring down, its patter broken 
               from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and 
               the boom of thunder.

               but inside it's cozy. the quarters are still crowded but 
               considerable order has been brought to bear on the place.

               he is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits 
               on the table. open at his side is his journal.

                         almost a month and no one has come. 
                         the longer this condition persists, 
                         the less inclined i am to believe 
                         that anyone will. rain has forced me 
                         indoors for most of two days. i have 
                         begun an awning. the work has ruined 
                         my hands, but i am excited about the 
                         improvement it will bring to this 
                         place.

               a great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room 
               with violent white light. dunbar walks to the door and tosses 
               out a handful of bones. two socks scurries to collect the 
               bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree.

                                     dunbar (v.o.)
                         it is the loneliest of times... but 
                         i cannot say that i am unhappy.
