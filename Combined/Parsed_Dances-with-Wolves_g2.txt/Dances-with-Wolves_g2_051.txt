               ext. trash pile - day

               oil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap. dunbar 
               empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto 
               the pile. he takes the match he's been holding between his 
               teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail. he flips it 
               onto the heap.

               the fire catches immediately and dunbar has to back away a 
               few steps as the flames send a column of thick, black smoke 
               into the air.

               to dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger... 
               climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see.

                                     dunbar
                         damn... damn.

               he stoops for his rifle and we follow as he scrambles up the 
               slope. the lieutenant clambers over the lip and stops to 
               scan the horizon.

               but we continue, following the black smoke as it towers higher 
               and higher until it is just a wisp.
