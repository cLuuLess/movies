               the scouts pull up in front of ten bears to make their report. 
               there's no way to know what's going on but something important 
               is happening.

               wind in his hair suddenly breaks ranks and rides back to the 
               main body of warriors. a dozen warriors strip off their shirts 
               and leggings. they're ready in moments. then, with wind in 
               his hair leading them, the party breaks away from the column 
               and rides east at a gallop.

               the column resumes its southward march.
