               ext. battlefield - day

               dunbar swerves in a little closer to the wall as he approaches 
               the other half of the confederate ranks. they're standing 
               ready, like a firing squad.

               tucker has just reached the side of ray the sharpshooter.

               the lieutenant shuts; his eyes, lets the reins flop on the 
               buckskin's neck and spreads his arms as they thunder toward 
               the line of riflemen.

               ray's finger squeezes the trigger, his keen eye sights down 
               the barrel of his gun. thud... a rifle ball buries itself in 
               ray's forehead.
