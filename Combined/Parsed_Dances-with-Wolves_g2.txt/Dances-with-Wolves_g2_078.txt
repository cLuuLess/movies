               ext. prairie - night

               smiles a lot pulls his pony up next to otter and peers down 
               at the fallen boy.

                                     smiles a lot
                         what happened?

                                     otter
                         i don't know. my arm doesn't work.

                                     smiles a lot
                         you shouldn't have fallen down... 
                         now we'll get in trouble.

                                     otter
                         it was your idea.

                                     smiles a lot
                         my idea was only to take the horse.

               this squabble is interrupted by worm's return. he gallops up 
               and jumps off his pony.

                                     smiles a lot
                         otter hurt himself.

               worm shakes his head in frustration. otter grabs a handful 
               of dirt and flings it at smiles a lot and worm.

                                     otter
                              (to worm)
                         you're not hurt... i'm hurt.

                                     worm
                         i will be when my father finds out, 
                         his bow will be across my back.
