               ext. river - day

               still in chains, dances with wolves and wind in his hair are 
               dragging elgin's body onto shore. dances with wolves rifles 
               through the dead man's pockets. he finds a set of keys and 
               plops down to unlock his shackles.

               the wounded indian warrior is being tended to. smiles a lot 
               is downstream washing bauer's blood off.
