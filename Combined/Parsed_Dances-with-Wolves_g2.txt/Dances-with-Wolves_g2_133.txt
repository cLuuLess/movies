               ext. temporary camp - day

               the band's best hunters, two dozen of them, are making ready 
               to chase the buffalo. it's the big time, no event is more 
               important. the villagers -- mostly women, children, and 
               elderly -- have gathered around each of the hunters.

               the largest audience has gathered around lieutenant dunbar 
               and wind in his hair. wind in his hair's pony is ready. great 
               bolts of yellow lightning adorn his shoulders and rump. right 
               now the warrior is drawing the same design along cisco's 
               rump.

               dunbar reads this correctly as a great honor and stands by 
               silently. wind in his hair is finished. he looks at dunbar 
               and nods at the paint as if asking for a response.

                                     dunbar
                         i wish i knew what to say.

               a sioux voice, using english words, sails out of the circle 
               of watchers.

                                     stands with a fist
                         say... thank you.

               startled the men turn to the sound. the other sioux are 
               stunned too.

                                     stands with a fist
                              (indicating the paint)
                         his speed... his power... you have.

                                     dunbar
                         thank you.

               he takes the warrior's hand in his own and shakes it crisply.
