               int. kicking bird's lodge - dawn

               now there's a ripping at the lodge entrance. the flap is 
               being torn away. black shawl is desperately pulling the child 
               back from the edge of the lodge.

               suddenly, there he is... a pawnee warrior. but now it's his 
               turn to be surprised. he sees stands with a fist taking aim, 
               and it's too late. she fires the rifle and the pawnee explodes 
               back out of the lodge.
