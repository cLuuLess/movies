int. hood bathroom. day

wendy enters the bathroom.

she fills the sink with water, then turns off the tap. she
takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly,
determinedly, holds it to her wrist.

she presses it into her skin, drawing a small drop of blood.

			wendy
	ouch!

she drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist, grabbing
some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound.

			wendy 
	stupid.

she hears the phone ring and walks downstairs.
