int. hood dining room. day

one by one, each member of the hood carried in a final item
to place on the overstuffed thanksgiving table. then, one by
one, they each silently take their seats.

they look over the table. no one moves.

			ben 
	well, it's great we can all be
	together. and this thanksgiving, no
	hysteria, no yelling, especially
	with grandpa not here, although we
	miss him. so let's do it right and
	actually, wendy, why don't you say
	grace. you used to love to say
	grace, remember.

wendy grimaces, as they all bow their heads slightly.

			wendy 
	dear lord, thank you for
	thanksgiving, and for letting us
	white people kill all the
	indians...

everyone looks up.

			wendy (cont'd)
	... and steal their tribal lands
	and stuff ourselves like pigs

mutterings and groans: "wendy!" "for christ's sake" etc.

			wendy (cont'd)
	... while children in africa and
	asia are napalmed and --

			ben 
	jesus all right enough!

they all unceremoniously start to dig in.
