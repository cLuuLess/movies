int. kitchen. night

hood and elena rise from the table with their dishes.

			ben
	what's for dessert?

			elena
	see for yourself.

			ben
	no advice from the experts, huh?

his plate slips out of his hands into the trash. he fishes it
out and sets it on the counter.

			elena
	don't start.

			ben
	you think i --

			elena
	i have no idea.

			ben
	what's on your mind? don't --

			elena
	it wouldn't make a pleasant
	evening, if that's what you're
	after. i don't want to talk about
	it. stupid mustache cup.

			ben
	what do you mean?

			elena
	don't be dim.

			ben
	elena, what are you're talking
	about?

			elena
	i'm not surprised.

			ben
	listen, elena, if you're gonna pull
	that passive aggressive stuff on me
	again --

			elena
	your unfaithfulness -- that's what
	i'm trying to talk about. your
	unfaithfulness. your betrayal. your
	dalliance. and you won't do me the
	dignity of being up front about it.

			ben
		(quieter)
	am i unfaithful? is that what
	you're trying to say?

			elena
	it's a starting place.

			ben
	well, what kind of faithfulness are
	you after?

			elena 
	if you're going to insult me --

			ben
	what else could i be? what else
	could i be? we're not living in the
	real world here. you're living out
	some fantasy land from the past, or
	some advice or something from those
	psychoanalysts... there are some
	hard facts here.

silence.

			ben (cont'd)
	it's the law of the land... the
	government, the world, those two
	guys on the yankees... and i'm not
	having any fun at it, i can tell
	you that. i'm not...
