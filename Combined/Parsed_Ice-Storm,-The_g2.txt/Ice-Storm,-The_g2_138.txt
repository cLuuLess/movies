the crowd's a bit thinner than before.

as dot halford begins calling out for everyone's attention, a
few couples make their last-minute way to the door.

			dot 
	ok everyone. we have a little
	business to attend to now. so
	everyone who'd like to stay, please
	gather in the living room.

she scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table
which has been put in the middle of the room.

			ben
		(walking up to elena)
	ready to go?

			elena
	we're not going anywhere.

elena waves at janey williams, who is standing across the
living room.

janey looks back without expression.
