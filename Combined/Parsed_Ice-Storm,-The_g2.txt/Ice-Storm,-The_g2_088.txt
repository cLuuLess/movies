int. hood car. day

			ben
	so how's school treating you?

			paul
	all right.

			ben 
	classes?

			paul
	good.

			ben 
	grades?

			paul
	fine.

			ben 
	anyone special? you know...

			paul
	hnnn.

			ben 
	well it's good to see you -- we
	miss you around the house and all,
	but this st. peter's, it's top of
	the line, eh?

			paul
	yeah.

			ben 
	you know paul, i've been thinking,
	maybe this is as good a time as any
	to have a little talk, you know,
	about -- well --

he makes a sharp turn. paul puts his arms up on the dashboard
to steady himself.

			paul
		(nervous)
	about?

			ben 
	well, the whole gamut. facts of
	life and all. some fatherly advice,
	because, i tell you, there's things
	happening that you're probably old
	enough... well...
		(pause)
	for example, on the self-abuse
	front -- now this is important -
	it's not advisable to do it in the
	shower -- it wastes water and
	electricity and because we all
	expect you to be doing it there in
	any case -- and, um, not onto the
	linen, and not on your sister's
	underwear or any clothing belonging
	to your mother --

he pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son,
then continues.

			paul 
	uh, dad --

just then ben runs a stop sign and almost slams into another
car.

			ben 
	holy! well. if you're worried about
	anything, just feel free to ask,
	and, uh, we can look it up.

			paul 
	uh, dad, you know i'm 16.

			ben 
	all the more reason for this little
	heart to heart... great.
