int. williams dining room. night

the kitchen door swings open into the dining room, and mikey
and sandy williams emerge, each holding platters of food.
mikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and sandy, 14, a sullen
and barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their
forearms -- they are the evening's "waiters".

they move unsteadily to the table, at which sit their parents
janey (38, a hard-edged, sharp-witted beauty) and jim (43,
large and a bit goofy, a genius inventor), together with
their guests, ben and elena hood, and neighbors dorothy and
ted franklin.

we jump cut through the evening's conversations, seen mostly
from the furtive pov's of the boys.

			ben 
	his brother came back --

			dorothy 
	from where?

			ben 
	vietnam.

			dorothy 
	oh. are we going to talk about
	this, about...?

			elena 
	you should hear. it's very sad, he
	was --

						jump cut:

janey is whispering something into mikey's ear, who returns
to the kitchen.

			jim 
	it was a benefit for the aclu or
	something, and harry reems himself
	was there --

			dorothy 
	the man with the -- from deep
	throat?

			jim 
	the very one -- something about a
	first amendment defense fund --
	well i believe in it --

			dorothy
	ted took me to see it.

			janey 
	ted, how romantic.

			dorothy
	i have to say, the movie didn't do
	much for me. but being in that
	theater, surrounded by all those
	horny young college boys and
	perverts, there was something in
	the air that --

						jump cut:

the boys are pouring wine.

			jim 
	-- pulls right up to the pump,
	jumps out like there's no gas
	shortage, oblivious, and by this
	point everybody in line's piling
	out of their cars ready to kill the
	guy, when they notice it's that
	reverend edwards --

			ben 
	the unitarian? the new one?

			jim 
	yeah -- claims he pulled off creek
	road and didn't notice the line
	going back mill street for half a
	mile.

			ben 
	he's either got his head in the
	clouds or up his --

			dorothy 
	i hear he's slept with half the
	women in his congregation --

			ted 
	lucky bastard!

as this is said, mikey accidentally spills some wine on ben.

			ben 
	hell! -- i mean, no problemo there
	mikey. here, i --

janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe
of ben's pants. is there a just barely noticeable frisson
between ben and janey as she removes the napkin? if there is,
elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice.

						cut to:

the boys, now in pajamas (sandy's with padded feet, mikey's a
combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out
coffee and dessert. the adults eye mikey's handling of the
coffee pot with some nervousness.

			dorothy
		(unconvincing)
	so fascinating. do you get free
	tickets to the movies, that kind of
	thing?

			ben 
	no, my job is just to analyze the
	entertainment stocks and advise our
	institutional investors on where to
	put their money. it's --

			elena 
	don't be so modest, ben. it's a job
	that requires a certain prescience
	with regards to entertainment
	trends. you were the first to
	predict that billy jack would be a
	hit --

			ben
		(with a bit too much
		 conviction) 
	and as usual no one believed me...

silence.

						cut to:

the dinner party has moved to the living room for after
dinner drinks. elena remains behind to help janey pick up the
table. she stacks a plate on top of another.

			janey 
	please don't.

			elena 
	it's not a bother.

			janey 
	i insist.
		(beat)
	don't touch them.

elena realizes that there's an edge to janey's voice.

			elena 
	oh.

			janey
		(realizing she's gone too
		 far)
	it's really quite all right.

			elena 
	of course.
