int. ben hood's office. day

ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. he looks up to
see george clair in his doorway.

			george 
	hey there benjie, you're becoming
	quite the in-house philosopher.
	when do you have time to think up
	all that stuff -- shackley sure
	eats it up.

intercut hall in front of ben hood's office

as we see that clair is deftly fondling hood's attractive
secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to
his office. she looks up coyly at clair, hidden for the
moment from ben's view.

ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. clair and
the secretary pull back, but it's clear that ben has some
sense of what's transpiring between them.

			ben 
	george, i'm just trying to get a
	global view of things -- can't just
	look at the small picture.

there's an obvious rivalry between the two of them.

			george 
	and speaking of which, you have
	those market share charts mr.
	shackley was asking about?

			ben 
	gotcha george, not a problem.
	tomorrow. hey, you want to start
	covering the old filmed
	entertainment sector yourself?

			george 
	ben you know that's your territory 
	- and i wouldn't dream to trespass 
	- you're the expert. hey, how do
	you think paramount's gonna do with
	that blatty novel, what's it
	called? the exorcist?

			ben 
	overpriced bomb, cost over $6
	million -- no stars, and no one's
	into the horror genre these days
	anyway. i'm advising the company
	recommend reducing positions there.
	it's disaster films that are gonna
	stay at the top.

			george 
	brilliant. hey, you heading out a
	little early today?

			ben 
	got a meeting uptown.

			george
		(already moving off)
	right o'.

			ben 
	up the organization!
		(then, to himself)
	bastard.

the secretary pretends not to hear.
