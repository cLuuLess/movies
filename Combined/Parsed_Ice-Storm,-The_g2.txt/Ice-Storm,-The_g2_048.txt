int. hood kitchen. night

elena is sorting through bills and writing checks at the
kitchen table. ben comes in and fills a glass with ice.

			elena
	the halfords have invited us again
	this year.

			ben
	you want to go?

			elena
	what do you think?

			ben
	well, it is a neighborhood
	tradition.

he comes up behind her, looks down at the checkbook.

			ben (cont'd)
	i'm, uh, going to bed.

			elena
	so early?

			ben
	rough day. good night.

he leans over and kisses her on the cheek. she sniffs.

			elena
	is that a new aftershave?

he recoils a bit.

			ben 
	oh yeah. musk, or something. you
	like it?

			elena 
	hmm. good night.

he walks uncertainly from the room. does she suspect?
