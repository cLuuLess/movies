int. coffee shop. day

elena and philip edwards are having coffee again.

			philip 
	in many ways, the church-bound
	tradition of the father, son, and
	holy ghost is simply a version of
	the parent-child-adult triad within
	us all. it's a primitive set of
	symbols for our inner psychology.

			elena 
	you're saying that christ is the
	child, and --

			philip 
	-- and god the angry parent, and
	the spirit the hope of an
	integrated adult self.

			elena 
	all well and good -- but tell me
	again what is it exactly that you
	believe in?

			philip 
	you ask what the point is?

			elena 
	that's right.

			philip 
	self-realization. ministering to
	help people reach their fullest
	potential. would you believe me if
	i told you i want you to see
	yourself reach your fullest
	potential and self-realization?

			elena 
	i would say it sounds like you're
	trying to get me into bed.

			philip 
	if that's a potential you see
	yourself fulfilling... i mean... 
		(flustered)
	my, i sound a bit --

			elena 
	i'm sorry. that was stupid of me. i
	didn't mean to be so rude.

			philip 
	you weren't. you actually, for some
	reason, you have the effect on me
	of making me feel just a tiny bit
	ashamed of myself.

			elena 
	but not too ashamed.

			philip 
		(smiling)
	now you are being rude.

			elena 
	and you're still trying to get me
	into bed.

			philip 
	ouch.

just then, dorothy franklin passes by their table, a smirk
firmly implanted on her face.

			dorothy 
	hello you two. am i barging in on
	some kind of religious study group?
	elena, you look marvelous. will i
	see you and ben at the halford's?

			elena 
	i suppose we'll make an appearance.

			dorothy 
	and reverend edwards? did you make
	the list?

			philip 
		(laughing)
	i believe so mrs. franklin.

			dorothy 
	with the two of you there it will
	be positively a revival! i'm off!

she scurries out of the coffee shop.

			philip 
	i'm afraid she's something of a
	gossip, isn't she?

			elena
		(gathering her things to
		 go)
	i'm afraid people around here
	provide her with quite a bit to
	gossip about. 
		(getting up)
	take care.

			philip 
	that i will indeed.
