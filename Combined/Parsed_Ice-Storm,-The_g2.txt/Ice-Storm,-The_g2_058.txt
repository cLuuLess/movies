elena rides her bike into town, infused with the girlish
sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter.

suddenly, there's a pop -- a tire is blown out. she slows
down and gets off the bike. as she bends to look at the
wheel, a station wagon slows near her. the driver's side
window rolls open. it's janey williams.
