int. hood kitchen. day

ben is in front of the open freezer, trying to get something
out. he hears elena come in the front door.

			ben 
	elena. i need some help here if
	this thing's gonna defrost by
	tomorrow.

she comes up and together they tug and pull until they
succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey. as they pull
it out, it slips from their hands and, after a dull thump,
slides along the floor.

they smile.

elena bends over to pick it up. ben observes her. she notices
his look.

			ben (cont'd)
	here.

he goes over and picks up the turkey, placing it in the sink.
he looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look.

			ben (cont'd)
	you all right there?

			elena 
	oh. sure, i -- did you remember to
	pick up the cranberry sauce?

			ben
	um, yes.

they stand together, his concern and her vulnerability
forming an awkward attraction between them.

			elena 
	because you like it on your turkey
	sandwiches.

			ben 
	i do. i'm -- are you...?

			elena 
	i... i think i am...

			ben 
		(pause)
	you know elena, i've been thinking--

			elena
	ben, maybe no talking right now? if
	you start talking, you're going to--

she kisses him as if she needed him.
