int. janey's car. day

elena sits in the passenger seat. the two women are obviously
uncomfortable with each other.

silence.

			elena 
	thanks again. for the dinner.

			janey 
	thanks for eating it. i don't know
	why i even pretend i can cook.

			elena 
	i used to know how to cook.

			janey 
	it's not like we're too busy.

they smile, barely.

			elena 
	i'm thinking of going back to
	school.

			janey 
	social work?

			elena 
	how'd you know?

			janey 
	educated guess.

			elena 
	i'm that predictable? no, you don't
	have to answer that. it's just that
	with the kids almost grown --

			janey 
	you don't have to apologize. i'm
	too much of a cynic. you actually
	seem to be trying to figure things
	out -- don't mind me.

she pulls the car over.
