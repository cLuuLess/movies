ext. new canaan high school field. day

a cool gray afternoon. a group of boys are playing flag
football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered
underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking
c1garettes.

wendy, beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one
group.

			beth
		(referring to one of the
		 girls gathered in the
		 other group)
	she said you licked dave brewster's
	weenie in the third floor bathroom.

			wendy 
	she's a liar. i wouldn't touch dave
	brewster's dick if you paid me.
	it's probably crawling with v.d.
	after he put it in her, which he
	did.

the conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups
of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar.

wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the
field where the boys are playing.

a group of boys break from a huddle, mikey among them.

the quarterback takes the hike and mikey runs out for a pass.
as he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his
ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard
before.

the quarterback spots him and throws a long one.

he runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.

the ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his
own, to run.

suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to
see all the other kids just standing there looking at him.
one of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the
explanation.

			mikey
		(as he returns to the
		 group, ball in hand)
	did anybody hear that?

the other kids snicker. wendy looks on, and catches mikey's
eye for a fleeting moment.

			wendy 
	i gotta go.

she takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off.
