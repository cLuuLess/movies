int. williams house. night

mikey, bundled up in a huge orange ski parka and cap, heads
for the door.

			sandy 
	where you going?

			mikey 
	out.

			sandy 
	it's freezing.

			mikey 
		(pausing)
	yeah. when it freezes, i guess that
	means the molecules are not moving.
	so when you breathe, there's
	nothing in the air, you know, to
	breathe in to your body. the
	molecules have stopped. so it's
	clean.

sandy just looks at him. he walks out into the night.
