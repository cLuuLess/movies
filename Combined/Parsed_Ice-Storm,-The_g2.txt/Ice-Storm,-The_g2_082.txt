int. hood bedroom. day

ben and elena undress shyly.

they make love. elena's face is almost fearful.

						cut to:

elena and ben lie in bed side by side in the pale afternoon
light. neither speaks. ben turns on his side, and notices a
small tear forming in elena's eyes.

			ben 
	you crying?

			elena 
	i'm just sad ben -- i mean it
	was... you were, but, you know. i
	just don't know...

			ben
		(gently making light)
	whatever that means elena -- and
	you complain about me not
	communicating... i thought it was --

			elena 
	no, i didn't mean to sound
	negative. it was -- but ben. 
		(beat)
	what is going to happen with us?
	have you --

			ben 
	you have to bring this up now?
	what? did i do something here? is
	that it? is it something i did?

			elena 
	i wasn't accusing you, ben. it's
	just that we've got to be honest.
	not just with ourselves, but with
	the children.

			ben
		(pause, sitting up)
	hell, i know. i -- i guess if you
	want to accuse me, you've got --
		(looks at watch)
	oh hell! i've got to pick up paul.
	i almost forgot.

he gets up and starts to get dressed.

			elena
	you were saying?

he smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on.

			ben
	yikes -- i was hoping to wear this
	thing to the halford's friday.

			elena
	that shirt?

			ben
	what?

			elena
	leave it -- i'll wash it for you.

he looks at her ruefully.
