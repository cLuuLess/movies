ext. street. day

wendy walks her bike with the wind in her face.

from behind her, mikey rides up on his bike and rides
alongside her.

she doesn't look at him.

trying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles,
nearly falling off.

			mikey 
	i don't ever want to see you.

			wendy 
	then why'd you come after me?
