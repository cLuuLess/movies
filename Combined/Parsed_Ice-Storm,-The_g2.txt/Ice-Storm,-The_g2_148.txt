			wendy 
	anyone home? hello.

wendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps.
the sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her.

she goes into mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster
zone than usual.

she sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual)
positions of the zodiac.

she notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it
up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out
of the room.

she walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving
the garter belt on the counter.

she opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and
scoops some up in her finger. as she puts her finger in her
mouth --

			sandy 
	wendy.

she gives out a little yelp.

			wendy 
	sandy, you scared the shit out of
	me.

			sandy 
	what are you doing?

			wendy 
	just thought i'd stop by.

			sandy 
	mike's out -- i think he went to
	silver meadow to see if you were
	hanging around there.

			wendy 
	yeah.

			sandy 
		(pause)
	are you his girlfriend?

			wendy 
	no.
