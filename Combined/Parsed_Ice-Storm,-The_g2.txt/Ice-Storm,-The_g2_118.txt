int./ext. car. cont'd

ben and elena climb back in the car and close the doors,
shivering.

			elena 
	this just isn't the best moment for
	this.

			ben 
	i know, i know. i had no idea --

			elena 
	that this was going to be a key
	party?

			ben 
	yeah, well, if we'd understood we
	could have invented some kind of
	excuse. a key party -- did you see
	how stuffed that bowl was already?

			elena 
	well?

			ben 
	i think we're here and we don't
	have to stay -- we ought simply to
	put in an appearance and then we
	can head home.

			elena 
	damn it, ben --

			ben 
	i'm not staying at this party so we
	can go home with someone else's
	wife. that's not why we're here,
	right? we're simply being neighbors
	here, and i think we should do just
	that --

			elena 
	you're not going to --

			ben 
	i'm not.

			elena 
	you have some marker, that's what i
	think, if you want to know the
	truth.
	you have some marker and you're
	going to put it on the house keys
	so that janey can find them and
	then when i get back to the house
	i'll find the two of you in there
	and wendy'll be able to hear you
	and paul will be back and he'll
	hear you and i'll catch you, that's
	what i think. she'll be swearing
	and banging against the wall and
	i'll catch --

			ben 
	elena.

she rubs her eyes.

			ben (cont'd)
	elena, it's not what you think.
	it's not a big plot. honestly.
	honestly. i don't know if you want
	to go over this now, but it's just
	something that comes over me. i
	don't feel good about it. i know
	i've done what i didn't want to do.
	i don't know --

			elena 
	well, i'm really pleased to hear a
	confession.

			ben 
	elena, you're just getting wound up
	to get wound up.

			elena 
	thanks for the diagnosis, ben.
	thank you. so let's just go to this
	fiasco if that's what you want to
	do. let's just go on in. i'd rather
	talk to anyone else but you.

she pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car,
and slams the door. he follows her.
