ext. street. evening

hood and wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain.

he looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm.

			ben 
	look, kiddo, don't worry about it.
	i really don't care that much. i'm
	just not sure he's good enough,
	that's all.

			wendy 
	huh?

			ben 
	i mean, he's not serious, he'll end
	up living off janey and jim, you
	watch.
	it's just that you develop a sense
	when you get older, if things are
	going to work out or if they won't,
	and sometimes it's not worth the
	mess...

she looks at him. they keep walking. she walks through a
puddle.

			ben (cont'd)
	your toes cold?

			wendy
	yeah.

he stops and lifts her in his arms.

			ben
	i'll carry you up the drive.

she puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up.

on her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real
intimacy.
