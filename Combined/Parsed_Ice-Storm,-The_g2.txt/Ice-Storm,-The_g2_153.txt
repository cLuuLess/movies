int. libbets' apartment. night

paul and libbets, still frozen in the same position. finally,
paul gently pushes libbets' head back.

it slides off his leg and, as paul lurches forward in a
failed attempt to grab it, libbets flops backwards, her head
hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump.

			paul
	oh shit!

paul gets up, looks down at her.

she snores.

he runs over to a side table and sees the clock: 11:10.

			paul (cont'd)
	oh shit oh shit.

he grabs his comic books and runs for the door.
