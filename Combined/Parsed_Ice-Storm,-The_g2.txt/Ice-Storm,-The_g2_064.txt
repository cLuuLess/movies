ext. five and dime. day

in a wide shot, from across the street, we see elena leave
the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and
taps her on the shoulder. they converse for a minute, and
elena is accompanied back into the store.

through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of
her purse. she's obviously distraught -- offering to pay,
talking quickly, etc. the shopkeeper is holding a telephone,
not yet decided on whether to call her in.

	to find yourself in the negative
	zone, as the fantastic four often
	do, means that all everyday
	assumptions are inverted -- even
	the invisible girl herself becomes
	visible, and so she loses the last
	semblance of her power.
