	-- because i've been reading
	kerouac and ginsberg and those guys
	were creating beat culture and
	traveling and sleeping wherever,
	and, of course, with all kinds of
	people, but when you read carefully
	the various contemporary accounts
	of their lives, and, uh, these guys
	didn't bathe much, i mean they were
	really filthy, with like genital
	crabs, lice, exceptionally strong
	body odor...

libbets smiles through her yawn.
