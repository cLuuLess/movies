int. train. night

as paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside
begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow. after a few
moments, the train grinds to a halt, and paul and his few
fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark,
with only the light of an emergency exit sign above paul's
head to light the scene.

the train is eerily silent.
