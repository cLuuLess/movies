int. libbets apartment den. night

paul re-enters the den to find francis alone.

			paul 
	and whence has yon virginal maiden
	absconded?

			francis 
	like into one of the other 20 or so
	bathrooms they've got in this
	place.

paul takes out the bottle and opens it.

			paul 
	check it out. not for the faint of
	heart.

			francis 
	pharmaceutical! you are a god.

			paul (cont'd)
		(picking up beer, trying
		 to hurry before libbets
		 returns)
	one for you and one for me.

he hands a pill to francis, then pretends to pop one into his
mouth and takes a swig of his beer. as francis downs his own,
paul pockets his unswallowed pill.

			libbets
		(in the doorway)
	no candy for me?

			francis 
	groovy.
		(to paul)
	young master of the revels, a treat
	for our hostess?

			paul 
	well, uh, i don't, it's really --

			libbets 
	what is it?

			francis 
	come on paulie, share the wealth.
	you copped 'em from her mom's stash
	anyway.

			libbets 
	let's see!

			paul
		(hand in pocket)
	libbets, you really shouldn't mix
	and match, you know with the beer.
	i'll put 'em back.

libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle.

			libbets 
	oh far out, paulie. hey look, these
	expired like five months ago. you
	think they're better aged?

she opens up the bottle and takes one out.

			paul 
	maybe you should have just a half.

			libbets 
	thanks for the advice dad.

she takes the pill.

paul looks on, thwarted.
