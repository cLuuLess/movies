int. hood living room. night

ben and elena take their seats on the sofa. wendy stands
before them holding an enormous trombone, with a music stand
and sheet music in front of her.

she puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz
time.

when she's done, she looks up from the sheet music to her
parents.

they applaud.

			ben
	can't wait to see how it fits in
	with all the other instruments.

elena gives him a look.
