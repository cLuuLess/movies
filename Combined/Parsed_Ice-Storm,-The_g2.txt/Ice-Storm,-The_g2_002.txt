various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.

on paul hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up
in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. he reads
his fantastic four comic book by the pale light of the
emergency exit sign.

suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the
train's engines returns.

the conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic
nasal voice.

			conductor 
	good morning ladies and gentlemen --

he sounds like a baseball announcer.

			passengers
		(mumbling, ad lib)
	what ladies?

			conductor 
	-- this train originating at new
	york's grand central station is
	back in service - next stop will be
	new canaan, connecticut. new
	canaan, connecticut, next stop!

he moves on to the next car.

the train begins to move.

paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the
still-dark early morning.

he looks back down at his comic book.

on the comic book: reed richards (also known as stretch) has
zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the
destructive energy that annihilus has implanted in him. 

the thing, medusa, flame, and richards' wife sue storm look
on, stunned.
	"then you've turned him into a
	vegetable. your own son." "don't
	you see, sue? he was too
	powerful... if his energy had
	continued to build, he would have
	destroyed the wqrld!"

paul looks up again, thinking.

			paul (v.o.)
	in issue number 141 of the
	fantastic four, published in
	november 1973, reed richards has to
	use his anti-matter weapon on his
	own son, who annihilus has turned
	into a human atom bomb. his son is
	the result of richards' coupling
	with the earthling sue storm, and
	the problem is that the cosmic rays
	that infused richards and the rest
	of the fantastic four on their
	aborted moon mission have made
	young franklin a volatile mixture
	of matter and anti-matter.
