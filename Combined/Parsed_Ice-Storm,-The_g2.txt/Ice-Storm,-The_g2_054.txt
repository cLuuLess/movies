int. club restaurant. day

ben and harold are at their table again. lunch is being
cleared.

			harold
	it's not the taxes i object to.
	it's all the fines and penalties.

			ben 
	alright dad. but you sold the
	house, you didn't tell anyone,
	including the irs, and i'd of
	certainly liked to have seen if
	there was any old stuff --

			harold 
	it was all junk!

another pause. ben decides not to pursue an overworked topic.

			ben 
	oh. elena wanted to know when we
	could expect you on thanksgiving.
	it's just going to be you this
	year.

			harold 
	ben, i'm going to florida. i hate
	thanksgiving and i hate the cold. i
	have a new nurse. she's a negro,
	she weighs three hundred pounds,
	and i've decided to leave my entire
	estate to her.

ben spits his drink out.

			ben 
	what?

			harold 
	jesus, benjamin, you're still as
	gullible as ever.

			ben 
	that was a joke? you don't tell
	jokes.

			harold 
	i thought i'd start trying. if you
	don't mind. but i am going to
	florida and i do have a new nurse.
