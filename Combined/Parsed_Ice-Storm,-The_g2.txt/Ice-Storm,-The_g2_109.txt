int. kitchen. night

a silent dinner of turkey sandwiches with elena, benjamin,
and wendy. the turkey carcass sits, embarrassed, in the
middle of the table.

wendy, finished, gets up from the table. opens the fridge,
but finds nothing. then goes to the candy shelf and grabs
some hot tamales, leaving the room without a word and going
into the den.
