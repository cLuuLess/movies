int. halford living room. cont'd

the room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and
various groupings.

elena slips into a side room.

benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours
a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none other
than george clair.

			george 
	benjie!

			ben 
	clair, george clair! what the hell
	brings you to new canaan?

			george 
	well, it's the funniest thing. i've
	been talking to some investors -- a
	little outside venture, you
	understand, between you and me --
	about a scheme to manufacture a new
	styrofoam packaging. little peanut
	like pieces that can really keep an
	item free from trauma during
	shipping. miraculous. anyway, it
	turns out the genius behind the
	whole project is your neighbor, jim
	williams. how about that!

			ben 
	well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a
	million coincidence. a real
	dreamer, jim williams, eh?

			george
	darned right. look here, benj,
	whaddya make of this sequel to the
	godfather? you think it's gonna
	work?

			ben
	don't see how. i think the public's
	had its fill of this gangster
	stuff. no, trust me -- disaster
	pics. and air hockey.

			george
	yeah, good.

benjamin catches a glimpse of janey, voluptuously attired,
across the room.

			george (cont'd)
	well, gonna make a break for the
	hors d'oeuvres guy.

			ben
	yeah, see you bright and early
	monday am.
		(beat)
	say, where's the wife?

			george
		(winking as he goes)
	in rhode island with the folks. i'm
	a free agent tonight.

at this, they both notice elena slowly gliding across the
other side of the room. clair gives ben a sideways glance,
then moves on.

ben makes straight for janey, who pretends to be preoccupied
with a plant.

			janey 
	oh jeez, benjie. well, here you
	are.

			ben 
	damn right, but where the hell were
	you?

			janey 
		(looking around)
	what are you talking about?

			ben
		(whispering, but too
		 loudly)
	don't bullshit me around, janey.
	jesus christ, i waited around for
	more than half an hour, in nothing
	but my boxer shorts, and -- and
	what's all that about? what the
	hell happened?

janey takes a sip of her drink.

			janey 
	a prior engagement overcame me.

			ben 
	what?

			janey 
	listen, benjamin hood. i have
	obligations that precede your...
	from before you showed up. one or
	two, you know, good-natured
	encounters, that doesn't mean
	i'm... i'm not just some toy for
	you. when i remembered some chores
	i wanted to get done before the
	party, i just did them, that's all,
	because i wanted to do them before
	i saw jimmy.

			ben 
	jimmy? jimmy? i don't know how to
	take this. and what do you mean,
	jimmy? i thought you said you and
	your husband --

			janey 
	how you take it isn't all that
	interesting to me, benjamin. i'm
	sorry --

			ben 
	i just can't believe you could be
	so --

stalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and
wander off.

the air is filled with talk of watergate, billie jean king,
the oil crisis, the mets.

benjamin goes over to the couch, where dave gorman is
chatting up an attractive younger woman.

			gorman
		(lighting up a joint)
	welcome to the monkey house has
	been a seminal influence on me --
	hey benjamin -- give it a try? this
	stuff will make some sense out of
	those larger questions.

			ben 
		(waving it away)
	thanks for the advice dave.

but then, benjamin changes his mind.

			ben (cont'd)
	uh, well, what the hey...

taking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his
lungs.

			ben (cont'd)
		(coughing)
	good shit.

			gorman 
	sure is good shit. it's opiated. i
	had it in my chamber for a while. i
	was smoking this other --

			ben 
	it's what?

			gorman
	don't fret, benjie, it's --

			ben 
	darn it, dave.

he rises unsteadily, weaving through the room's
conversations.

			jack moellering 
	take california. they've got their
	own airline in-state that's not
	subject to the fare controls.
	compare sacramento to l.a. on the
	controlled airlines and you'll see
	what friedman is saying -- supply
	and demand, less restriction.

benjamin walks over to a window. the outdoor lamps illuminate
a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet.
