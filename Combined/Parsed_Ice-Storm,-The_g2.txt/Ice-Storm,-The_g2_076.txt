	a person's body is his temple,
	wendy. this body is your first and
	last possession. now as your own
	parents have probably told you, in
	adolescence our bodies tend to
	betray us. that's why, in samoa and
	in other developing nations,
	adolescents are sent out into the
	woods, unarmed, and they don't come
	back until they've learned a thing
	or two.
