int. sandy's room. night

sandy and wendy are sitting on the floor. he grabs his g.i.
joe.

			sandy 
	check this out. he's supposed to
	talk all kinds of stuff, but he's
	like malfunctioned.

he pulls the dog tag on the doll, and g.i. joe emits a
plastic macho voice.

			g.i. joe 
	mayday! mayday! get this message
	back to base!

			sandy 
	same thing. again and again.

wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord.

			g.i. joe 
	mayday! mayday! get this message
	back to base!

			sandy 
	it's gonna get a lot colder
	tonight, i predict. probably a
	blackout. do you have candles in
	your house?
	i know where the candles are, and i
	have my own flashlight. over there.
	also, i know where every emergency
	exit is on this floor.

during the course of his monologue, as wendy looks on, sandy
calmly ties a noose for his doll.

			sandy 
	this knot's called a bowline.

he puts the noose over the doll's head, as wendy holds him.

			g.i. joe 
	mayday! mayday!

			sandy 
	let's hang him.

sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer.
g.i. joe dangles. they both look at him in silence.

the silence continues.

			wendy 
	he's dead.

			sandy 
	if it wasn't raining we could take
	him outside and blow him up.

			wendy 
	he wouldn't blow up. he'd just get
	all mangled or twisted.

she takes him down and lays him flat on the bed. and then
begins to remove his clothes.

sandy looks on, desirous.

			wendy 
	well.
		(noticing his lack of
		 anatomy) 
	it looks like someone got to his
	private parts before us.

			sandy 
	communist viet cong.

			wendy 
	they left it in the jungle.

they speak with high seriousness.

wendy slides up on the bed where sandy sits, a pillow on his
lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes
her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels.

			wendy 
	can i get into your bed? 
		(pause)
	with you?

sandy begins to shake.

			sandy 
	we -- we have to go to the guest
	room. we can't stay in here. what
	if mikey? my parents?

			wendy 
	don't worry about them. they're at
	that party, getting drunk and
	falling all over each other and
	making jokes about mcgovern and
	stuff.

sandy begins to cry.

			sandy 
	it's just -- it's just --

she takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down
the hall, into the guest room.
