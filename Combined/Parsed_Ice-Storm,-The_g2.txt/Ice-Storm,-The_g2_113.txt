	oh lord. you think i'm so dense.
	and now you want to be seen with
	your dense wife at the cocktail
	party. you want to wear that
	ridiculous shirt which doesn't go
	with those pants at all. you want
	to wear that, and you want me to
	shake hands with your friends and
	make conversation and dress up in
	an outfit that shows a lot of
	cleavage and you're not going to
	accord me the respect of talking
	honestly about this... you don't
	really know what this feels like.

		(whispering)
	sure i do. do i know what
	loneliness feels like? sure i do. i
	know a lot about it, if that's what
	you mean.

			elena 
	benjamin. that's supposed to
	explain it?

seemingly tired, he stands before her. silence. elena sighs,
then walks into the den.
