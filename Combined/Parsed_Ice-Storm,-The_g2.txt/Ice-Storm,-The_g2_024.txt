int. hood upstairs hallway. night

ben and elena walking past wendy's room to their bedroom.

			ben 
	you'd think she'd learn how to cook
	a chicken, eh? my drumstick was
	still frozen when you cut inside
	there. i'm probably going to get
	whatever that disease -- and jim,
	how that guy ever became a
	millionaire --

he pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the
telephone cord under wendy's room.

			ben (cont'd)
	hmm. i knew she'd still be up.
	watch this --

but elena simply continues into the master bedroom.

he starts to pull gently on the cord. and continues pulling.
no response for a few seconds. then:

continued: 25

			wendy (o.s.)
		(yelling behind her door)
	dad stop it!

			ben 
	get to sleep young lady -- and i
	mean it.

wendy opens the door to her room.

			wendy 
	fascist!

			ben 
	if i were a fascist i would have
	sent you to one of those southern
	military academies a long time ago.
	now get to bed.

she slams the door.

he opens it.
