int. williams living room. cont'd

on the living room floor, jim is hugging mike's body, his
shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing.

wendy walks and stands next to sandy, who is filled
momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward
her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike
hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining ben and elena
on the driveway. sandy watches her go, his face wet with
tears.
