ext. silver meadows swimming pool. day

the wind is picking up and the light is fading. mikey and
wendy climb the fence around the pool, which is empty and
half-covered in dead leaves and twigs.

they climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the
deep end, leaning against the far wall of the pool.

they each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it
behind their ears.

they begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in
each others' mouths.

we see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves
swirl lightly around them, mikey groping under wendy's
poncho.
