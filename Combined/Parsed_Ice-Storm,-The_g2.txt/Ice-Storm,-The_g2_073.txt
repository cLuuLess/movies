int. williams living room. day

later, still mentally devolving in front of the tv, but with
various junk food detritus surrounding them and a different
show, a rerun of the original highway patrol.

sandy wanders off.

						cut to:

later.

wendy gets up, goes upstairs, and wanders down the hall to
the bathroom.

she gets to the door just as sandy gets there from the
opposite direction.

			wendy 
	after you.

sandy hesitantly opens the door, as wendy still hovers by it.

			sandy 
	well, you can...

			wendy 
	hey sandy, what were you blowing up
	out there? your mom was pretty
	p.o.'d.

			sandy 
	all my model planes.

			wendy 
	the ones you built?

			sandy
	they were old. and they couldn't
	fly anyhow. i'm going to get a
	radio-controlled airplane at
	christmas, and then i'll stuff it
	full of m-80s and then fly it into
	mrs. burgess's english class and
	blow it up.

			wendy 
	i have to go to the bathroom.

			sandy 
	yeah.

but he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the
doorway.

wendy looks around -- no one in sight.

			wendy 
	i'll show you mine if you show me
	yours.

sandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into
the bathroom like a feather.
