int. guest room. night

wendy and sandy enter. she sees the vodka bottle on the
dresser.

			wendy 
	want a drink?

			sandy 
	vodka?

			wendy 
	you never tasted the stuff?

she fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to
sandy.

they clink and each toss back a sip -- wendy almost the
entire glass.

sandy coughs and gags, but swallows.

			wendy 
	try again.

he does.

			sandy 
	it feels warm.

			wendy 
	one more shot?

			sandy 
	okay.

they drink.

			wendy 
	under the covers.

under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges.

			wendy
		(feeling her way)
	get 'em off.

sandy begins to laugh, and soon wendy joins him.

they roll around on top of each other for a while.

			wendy 
	have you ever had a nocturnal
	emission?

			sandy 
	huh?

			wendy 
	that's the name for when you wake
	up and find this little pool of
	sticky stuff, like after a sexy
	dream.

sandy shakes his head.

			wendy 
	they didn't tell you this stuff
	yet? what planet do you live on?

sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and
kisses her neck.

			sandy
	i love you.

			wendy 
	that's nice. are you drunk?

			sandy 
	i don't know. how do i know?

			wendy 
	i don't know either. you spin
	around, when you lie down.

sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.

			sandy (cont'd)
	i don't think i'm spinning.

they cuddle up together.

he yawns. she yawns.
