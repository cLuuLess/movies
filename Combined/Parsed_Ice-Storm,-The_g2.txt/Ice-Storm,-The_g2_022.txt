int. mike's room. night

they enter mike's room -- the door has a "nuclear waste 
positively no admittance" sign on it.

as mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and
starts to make retching noises. he then throws himself onto
the bed, his head leaning over the far side.

sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed.
taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks
it up -- it's fake plastic vomit. he throws it on top of
mike's back, but mikey doesn't take notice.

			sandy
	stupid!
		(pause, looking sullenly
		 at mike's back)
	is wendy hood your girlfriend?

			mikey
		(not looking up, but
		 alarmed)
	who said so?

			sandy
	no one.

			mikey
	i don't have a girlfriend.

mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of the sensuous woman,
obviously well pawed over. he absentmindedly picks his nose.
as he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical humming
sound begins to fill his ears. he frowns and pauses to listen
to it.

sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane,
obviously doesn't hear it.

mikey focuses on the plane as sandy waves it through the air.
perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars
through the sky...
