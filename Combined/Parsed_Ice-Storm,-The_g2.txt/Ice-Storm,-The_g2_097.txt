int. williams guest room. day

janey williams is pouring benjamin hood a drink from a bottle
of vodka. benjamin is already unbuttoned and shoeless; janey
still fully dressed.

			janey 
	here.

			ben 
	after the thanksgiving i had, i
	need it. you having one?

			janey 
	in a bit.

she sits next to him, he kisses the back of her neck.

			ben 
	you know, i think elena might
	suspect something.

janey gives him a rather contemptuous look.

			ben (cont'd)
		(thinking aloud)
	maybe it's all for the better, you
	know?
	yesterday, at dinner, well, she
	hasn't said anything... has she
	acted funny to you, i mean, have
	you noticed anything?

			janey
		(almost ironic)
	have i noticed anything? i'm not
	married to her benjamin, you are. i
	think you've probably a better
	vantage point from which to observe
	her.

			ben 
	yeah, but, i -- i've been working a
	lot lately, and -- no, that's not
	it. i guess we've just been on the
	verge of saying something, whatever
	it is, just saying something to
	each other. on the verge.

janey gets up.

			janey 
	i'll be back.

benjamin looks at her quizzically.

			ben
	huh?

			janey
	birth control.

			ben
	right. gotcha.

she leaves the room.

he leans back onto the bed. sits back up. takes a sip of
vodka. puts the glass down. takes his socks off. he's now in
just his jockey shorts and shirt.

faintly, he hears a door close. the front door?

he takes another sip.

he hears another sound.

			ben (cont'd)
	janey?

nothing.

he goes to the door and carefully opens it.

			ben (cont'd)
		(quietly)
	janey?

he hears, quite audibly, a car door open, close, janey's car
start and pull out.

he runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of
her driving off.

			ben (cont'd)
	shit.
