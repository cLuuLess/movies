ext. train - darkness before dawn

suburban connecticut, outside of new york city, 1973. the
still after a terrible storm. trees dripping, their branches
torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. the
train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow
emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from
the track.
