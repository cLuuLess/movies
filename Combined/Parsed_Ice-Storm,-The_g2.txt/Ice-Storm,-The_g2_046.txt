int. hood kitchen. evening

wendy enters the house as elena is finishing supper
preparations.

			wendy 
	hi mom.

			elena 
	hi wendy.

without waiting for instructions, wendy starts pulling out
plates and silverware and setting the table.

			elena (cont'd)
	i saw you on your bike today.

			wendy 
	with mikey?

			elena 
	who?

			wendy 
	nobody.

			elena 
	mikey williams?

			wendy 
	we were just riding around.

elena takes this in.

			elena 
	well, you looked very -- free --
	when i saw you.

wendy continues setting the table.

			elena (cont'd)
	weightless almost -- as if i were
	seeing my own memories of being a
	girl. there was something internal
	about it.

			wendy 
	mom. are you ok?

			elena 
	wendy, of course. i'm sorry. you
	must think i'm ripe to be checked
	into silver meadows.

			wendy 
	you're not a psycho!

			elena 
	the people at silver meadows aren't
	psychos.

			wendy 
	i know. they're rich drug addicts
	and celebrities. when i saw james
	taylor there, and --

			elena 
	we've been through this wendy 
	james taylor was actually at that
	clinic up near boston.

			wendy 
	well, i saw what i saw, and if you
	don't want to believe me --

			elena 
	oh wendy.

wendy frowns.

			wendy 
	they need the money for my band
	uniform at school.

			elena 
	i thought you quit the band - i
	never hear you practice anymore.

			wendy 
	i don't really need to practice. i
	just play a few notes, you know, so
	i thought maybe i'd stay in.

			elena 
	well, i'm sure your father and i
	would love to hear what you're
	playing these days. maybe after
	dinner.
