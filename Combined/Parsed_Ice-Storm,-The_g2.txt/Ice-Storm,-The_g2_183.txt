ext. conrail station. early morning

the train slowly pulls in. the hood family walks down to the
end of the platform.

the train doors open, and paul, tired and a bit cramped,
emerges. he sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform, and walks to them.

they stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.

when he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get
in.
