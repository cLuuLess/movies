int. mike's room. night

mikey is painfully at work writing an english essay. sandy
comes to the door with a geometry textbook.

			sandy 
	mikey?

			mikey 
	yeah?

			sandy 
	geometry?

			mikey 
	sure, anything but this english.

sandy puts the open textbook in front of him.

			sandy 
	why are you so good at math but not
	in english?

			mikey 
	i'm not good at math. just
	geometry.

he looks at the book.

			mikey (cont'd)
		(drawing out his examples
		 on a piece of paper) 
	it's like, you know when they say
	"two squared"? and you think it
	means 2 times 2, equals 4? but
	really they really mean a square. a
	square with a side of two. and the
	area of the square is four. like
	every time you use the word, like
	squared, or cubed, it's really
	space, it's not numbers, it's
	space.
	and it's perfect space, but only in
	your head, because you can't draw a
	perfect square, like in the
	material world, but in your mind,
	you can have perfect space.
		(pause)
	you know?

as mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear
faintly the humming sound under his voice.

			sandy
	yeah. but i just need some help
	with my homework.

a knock at the door. jim stands in the doorway with a
suitcase in his hand.

			jim 
	hey guys, i'm back.

			mikey
		(honestly confused)
	you were gone?

sandy looks at mikey as if pondering a lost cause.

			jim
		(a look of
		disappointment) 
	yeah mikey. yep, i was in houston,
	working on some great new ideas
	about silicon, which comes from
	sand, very conductive. how you guys
	doing? how's school?

mikey's still flustered.

			mikey 
	uh, i dunno. ok i guess.

			jim 
	hmm. alright!

he walks off.

			sandy 
	you really didn't notice? man, he's
	been gone for three days.
