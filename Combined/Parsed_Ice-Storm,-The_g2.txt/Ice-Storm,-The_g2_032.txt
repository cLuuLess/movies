int. club restaurant. day

a stuffy, ivy league atmosphere. a decades-old tradition of
serving overcooked american food. ben is seated across from
his father, harold hood, a retired curmudgeon. there is a
walker parked by harold's chair.

			harold
		(waylaying a passing
		 waiter) 
	i'd asked for that double martini
	about three hours ago!

			waiter 
	coming right up, sir.

			harold 
	so asking me out for lunch -- what
	prompted this exceptional event? --
	of course i'm paying.

			ben 
	we don't have to always go to your
	club, dad.

			harold 
	and why are you still calling me
	dad? you're forty years old
	already, and --

			ben 
	-- well what am i supposed to call
	you?

			harold 
	that's besides the point.

the martini arrives, along with ben's beer.

			ben 
	i was actually trying to see about
	getting a little advice, you know --

			harold 
	advice? i'm supposed to be getting
	the stock tips from you, ben.
	unless - have you quit your job?
	they fired you?

			ben 
	you know, dah--

he looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not
paying attention.

			ben (cont'd)
	actually it's not about work, it's
	advice about --

			harold 
	oh for crying out loud ben, you
	don't mean to tell me that your
	marriage is going down the drain
	now --

			ben 
	well, elena and i have kind of been
	talking, not really talking, but --

			harold
	-- your mother, god bless her,
	stood by me for forty-two years --
	we never once contemplated divorce 
	- i assume you're talking here
	about divorce? the very thought --

			ben
	but dad, you guys truly hated each
	other, i mean really hated each --

			harold 
	-- waiter! where's my cobb salad? 
		(back to ben)
	you want advice ben? if your big
	brother were still alive i'd have
	him go out into the back yard and
	beat some sense into your head.
	look kid, you married that woman
	against my advice --

			ben
	-- what advice? you never --

			harold
	that's besides the point. the point
	is if i'd had any sense in me i'd
	have divorced your mother 40 years
	ago, and that's the truth, and here
	it is, 1972 --

			ben
	-- 73

			harold
	-- 73, and divorce is as easy as
	paying off a traffic ticket, and
	for crying out loud, ben, be a man
	and just get it over with. i would
	have if i'd had the chance.

ben ponders, as the food arrives.

			ben 
		(weakly)
	but...

			harold 
	but what?

			ben 
	but i -- well maybe i love her.
	elena.

his father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork.

			harold 
	christ ben! make up your mind and
	eat your lunch.
