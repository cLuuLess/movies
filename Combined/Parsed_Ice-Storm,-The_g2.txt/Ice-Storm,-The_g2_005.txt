ext. conrail station. early morning

the train slowly pulls in.

the train doors open, and paul, weary from the long night,
emerges. he sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform -- ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining
traces of his boyish looks; elena, 37, distant and elegant
even in her oversized sweater; and wendy, 14, a sullen
suburban lolita.

he pauses, regarding them.

they stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.
