int. st. peter's hallway. day

paul walks with marge.

			paul 
	i'm in love with libbets casey.

			marge 
	yeah, well, you've been in love
	with like every other girl here, i
	was wondering when you'd get around
	to libbets.

			paul 
	it's beyond mere physical
	attraction.

			marge 
	that's good, because i don't think
	libbets is capable of the sex act.

			paul 
	truly? do speak.

			marge 
	my diagnosis is messed in the head.
	a poor little rich girl -- i mean
	check out the jeans and fur look.
	and lend your ears to this
	brutality. like her mom and step
	dad and her step-sisters are going
	to switzerland to ski over
	thanksgiving break -- and like they
	didn't invite her!

			paul
	how do you know this shit?

			marge 
	they did it last year too. it's
	like traditional or something.
	they've got this humongoid park ave
	apartment and she just holes up
	there with a wad of cash. 
		(beat)
	aren't the hugely wealthy sad?

			paul 
		(pause)
	you think francis is going to beat
	me to the punch here?

			marge 
	since he sleeps with every girl you
	ever show an interest in, why don't
	you just keep your libbets thing a
	secret from him?

			paul 
	good thinking marge.
