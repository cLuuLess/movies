int. halford's. night

elena sits on a couch, talking to no one, barely looking up,
when someone stands in front of her.

			elena 
	reverend edwards.

			philip 
	perhaps you might find it in your
	heart to call me philip?

he sits beside her.

			elena 
	you're here... i'm a bit surprised.

			philip 
	sometimes the shepherd needs the
	company of the sheep.

			elena 
	i'm going to try hard not to
	understand the implications of that
	simile.

philip's about to reply, but thinks better of it.

they sit glumly next to each other for a minute. then philip
rises.

			philip
	forgive me.

he walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys
out of the bowl, then heads for the door.

			ted franklin
		(passing by)
	i hope those weren't my keys.

he laughs at his own joke as philip rushes out the front
door.

back to elena, even more forlorn than before.
