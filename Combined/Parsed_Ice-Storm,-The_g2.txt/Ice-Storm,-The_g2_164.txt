ext. street. night

a power line is down. it hisses and hums -- a humming very
much like the humming mikey has been hearing earlier.

the humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which
mikey has become so accustomed at such moments.

mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the
sound and the snaking coil of electricity.

a strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face,
as the power line connects to the guardrail.

			mikey 
	oh shit.

glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the
current flows through him.

after a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.
