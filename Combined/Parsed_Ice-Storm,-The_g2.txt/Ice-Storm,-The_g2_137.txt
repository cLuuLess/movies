int. libbets' apartment. night

libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping francis, who's crashed
out on the floor in a corner. francis alternates between
snores and various mumbled delirious ravings.

			francis 
	the foot... the foot... toeclipper
	man...

paul is sitting on the couch, and libbets comes back and sits
at his feet, facing up to him.

			paul 
	i guess he's just real exhausted
	from, you know, tests and stuff.

libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland.

			libbets 
	yeah.

			paul 
	you know libbets, i really feel,
	you know, like a real connection to
	you --

			libbets 
	yeah but you don't even know me
	really.

			paul 
	sure i do, you know, like your
	aura. that you give off.

			libbets 
	my what?

			paul 
	it's like very positive, and i feel
	a real special feeling, because you
	really --

			libbets 
	and i have a special feeling too,
	because i do. it's special.

			paul 
	you do? i'm glad. because i feel
	for you --

			libbets 
	and i have a feeling for you too,
	because you're just like -- i feel
	for you like you're -- you're just
	like --

			paul and libbets
		(simultaneously)
	-- like a brother.

			paul 
	yeah, you're not alone with that
	line.

			libbets 
	i do.

			paul 
	right. cool. so, how about we take
	a bath together?

			libbets
		(consciousness fading
		 fast)
	hah hah you're funny. a bath. like
	a brother and sister. oh man, i'm
	so wasted.

her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her
head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack
dab between paul's legs.

she begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into
his crotch.

paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. then, slowly, he
leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of
his body.

he looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and
received a lobotomy.
