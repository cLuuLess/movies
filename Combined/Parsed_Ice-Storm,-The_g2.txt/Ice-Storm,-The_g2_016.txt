int. dorm hallway. night

paul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall.

			paul 
	hello?

intercut - hood household. night

it's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper,
etc.) suburban house.

ben hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand.

			ben 
	paul?

in the background, we can see wendy watching richard nixon on
tv.

			paul 
	hi dad.

			ben 
	hey guy. things ok up there? you
	all right?

			paul 
	i'm fine dad.

			ben 
	well good. just confirming. you'll
	be on the 3:50 wednesday afternoon.

			paul 
	well dad, actually i thought i'd
	take the morning train on
	thanksgiving -- got a lot of
	studying, papers, you know, lab
	experiments --

			ben 
	lab experiments? right smart guy --
	paul, you know your mother's gonna
	be disappointed not to see more of
	you -- in fact, let me make this
	more than a simple request guy, i
	think you should...

in the background:

			nixon
		(on tv, from san clemente
		 press conference) 
	well, with regard to the questions
	as to why americans feel we were
	wrong to make the tapes, that is
	not particularly surprising. i
	think that most americans do not
	like the idea of taping
	conversations and, frankly, it is
	not something that particularly
	appeals to me...

			ben 
	hold on for a second.
		(turning)
	wendy, you want-to say hi to your
	brother?

she frowns.

			ben (cont'd)
	come on!

she gets up sullenly and goes to the phone.

			wendy 
	charles.

			paul 
	charles. have you been keeping out
	of my shit? have you refrained from
	entering the sacred precincts of my
	room?

			wendy 
	i have not touched your sh--
		(looks at father)
	stuff. you watching this?

			paul 
	watching what?

			wendy 
	nixon, doofus! it's incredible. he
	should be shot.

			ben
		(overhearing)
	hey, that's the president of the
	goddam united states you're talking
	about, wendy!

from the kitchen, elena overhears. she's dressed to go out,
but in the process of making a kraft macaroni and cheese
dinner for wendy.

			wendy 
	he's a liar!
		(still talking more to her
		 father than into the
		 phone)
	dean told him on march 21st about
	kalmback and hunt, all about the
	payoffs to the watergate burglars,
	so you tell me where the so-called
	"dean report" is, but you can't
	because it doesn't exist, because
	he lied about haldeman and
	erlichman and the april 17 tape,
	that's why! liar!

ben retreats, going to the wet bar to pour another drink.

			ben
		(muttering)
	ok, ok, the defense rests.
		(to elena in the kitchen)
	want another?

			elena (o.s.)
	no thank you. we should be off.

			ben 
	gotcha.

he puts the bottle back down without pouring.

intercut back to paul:

			paul
		(on the phone)
	hey charles. charles, calm down --
	i wasn't in on it.

elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives
wendy a kiss on the forehead as wendy mumbles her good-byes
to paul on the phone.

			elena 
	dinner's on the counter. we'll be
	at the williams's -- you know the
	number. 
		(takes the phone from
		 wendy)
	paul. hi. is there anything you'll
	want, any particular kind of food
	or snack or anything we can stock
	up on?... you're all right? ... ok.
	see you next week. i love you.

back to nixon on the tv.

			nixon 
	we must recognize that one excess
	begets another, and that the
	extremes of violence in the 1960s
	contributed to the extremes of
	watergate...

on wendy as she regards the tv, hearing her parents'
farewells as they leave through the front door.
