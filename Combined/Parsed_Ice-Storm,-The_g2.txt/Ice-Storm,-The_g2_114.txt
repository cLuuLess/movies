	we're going to the halford's. the
	number's on the calendar in the
	kitchen. we should be home around

			wendy
		(eyes still glued to the
		 tv)
	is it a big party? a big
	neighborhood party?

			elena 
	i suppose. why?

			wendy 
	just curious. if there's a problem,
	i guess i'll just call you there to
	interrupt.

			elena 
	what sort of problems are you
	planning exactly?

elena kisses the top of her head.

			wendy
		(still watching the tv)
	oh i thought i'd steal the station
	wagon, drive up to a commune. or
	set the house on fire. you know.

			elena 
	just bundle up. it's supposed to
	freeze tonight. we'll see you in
	the morning.
