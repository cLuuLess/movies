int. paul and francis's dorm room. morning

cramped, a mess, but quaint. paul shares the room with
francis davenport iv, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.

paul's alarm clock rings. he slams his hand down on it and
jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie
uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail
untucked in, etc. across the room, francis beckons from his
desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.

			francis 
	arise and shine, young hood.

			paul 
	i hope you changed the water in
	that bong from last night.

			francis 
		(finishing a hit)
	the water, as you call it, is a
	special mixture of amaretto and
	ben&ben blended for just the exact
	chemical interaction with the last
	of our precious thai stick.

paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. he coughs,
spewing uninhaled smoke.

			francis (cont'd)
	waste not master hood -- that was
	$20 for the bag.

			paul 
		(gathering books, papers,
		 almost talking to
		 himself)
	man, francis, you are one drug
	addled elitist freak, and when the
	revolution comes i do not want to
	be lined up with you and shot,
	'cause you're fucking ripe for
	political reeducation, you know,
	like in the fields.

			francis 
	paul, cancel your mental
	appointments, baby. what are you,
	like still stoned from last night?

			paul 
		(spraying some chloroform
		 mouth spray)
	i gotta get to english class.
