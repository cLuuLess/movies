int. wendy's bedroom. night 

ben enters the room, angry.

			ben 
	hey!

wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up
over her head. he stands over her, looking down at the
crumpled pile of sheet and blanket.

			ben (cont'd)
		(softening)
	hey, kiddo. sleep well, huh.

he places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses
the sheet.

			wendy
		(without pulling the sheet
		 down, but nicely)
	good-night dad.

			ben 
	good night kiddo.

ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent elena standing
in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face.
