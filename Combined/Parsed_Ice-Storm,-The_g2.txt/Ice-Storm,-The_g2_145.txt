int. jim's cadillac. night

they climb in.

			jim 
	we're going to have to defrost this
	thing for a while.

he turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold
air at them.

he leans over and kisses her.

			elena 
	do these seats go back?

that starts it. he jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping
himself.

they tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. and then,
comically, he's in her.

with a groan, it's over in a flash.

jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.

			jim 
	that was awful, really awful. i'm
	so sorry, elena.

elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove
compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate
herself.

			jim 
	things are really rotten at home.
	you wouldn't believe how rotten.
	janey's sick. she's unstable, i
	guess... it's not the right time to
	tell you... but that's it -- it's
	like i can't make her happy, the
	boys can't make her happy, she just
	doesn't --

			elena 
	jim, maybe we should just go. i've
	got to look in on the kids. paul is
	supposed to be coming back in from
	the city.

			jim 
	jesus, let me make it up to you --
	i can do better than that, honestly
	--

			elena 
	well, we can talk about it.

			jim 
	that's fine. i wouldn't expect you
	to see it any other way.

			elena 
	maybe you just need -- look, can
	you wait here a sec, i need to tidy
	up -- just a minute, i'll be right
	back. you'll wait?

			jim 
	of course.

she opens the door and walks back to the house.
