int. williams guest room. day

a couple are in the final throes of lovemaking. we see janey
williams's face, more or less enjoying the proceedings. the
man gives a final heave and groan, and rolls off to reveal
himself to be -- ben hood.

						jump cut to:

janey smokes a cigarette. ben is babbling.

			ben
	we were golfing, and you know,
	golfing to me is something i'm
	supposed to enjoy, and i was on the
	goddam golf team in college, so
	it's something one would assume i
	do well -- i used to do well -- but
	basically these days golfing for me
	is like hoeing, or plowing.

janey smiles briefly at this.

			ben (cont'd)
	it's like farming. i am basically
	chewing up large tracts of
	expensively landscaped scenery with
	overpriced sticks, and george clair
	has obviously, in the mere two
	years since he joined the firm, he
	has obviously been taking secret
	lessons with a golf pro, and i
	assume the entirety of his
	disposable income has been devoted
	to humiliating me on the golf
	course. and the guy talks -
	incessantly -- throughout the
	entirety of the miserable 18 holes 
	- on topics that are the supposed
	domain of my department --

			janey
	ben--

			ben
	yeah?

			janey
		(gently)
	you're boring me. i have a husband.
	i don't particularly feel the need
	for another.

			ben
	you have a point there. that's a
	very good point. we're having an
	affair. right. an explicitly sexual
	relationship. your needs. my needs.
	you're absolutely right.

			janey
	you should probably get dressed.
	the boys will be home soon.

			ben
	gotcha.

she wraps a blanket around herself and gets up.
