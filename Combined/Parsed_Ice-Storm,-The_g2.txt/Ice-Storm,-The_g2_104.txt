int. basement. day

wendy and mikey stand in the middle of the semi-lit basement.

			mikey 
	maybe we can mess around. you know,
	only if you want to...

			wendy
	i don't know.

			mikey
	why did you -- with sandy?

			wendy
	i don't know.

			mikey
	you like him? he worships you.

but wendy doesn't seem to hear -- she's drawn to an object
lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side.

			wendy
	hey, what's this?

with a look of utter fascination, she picks up a nixon mask,
looking at it as though it were an archeological find.

			wendy (cont'd)
	wow!

			mikey
	wendy!

she puts the mask on.

			wendy
		(from behind the mask)
	i won't take my pants off. but i'll
	touch it. that's as far as it goes.

mikey looks totally confused.

remaining fully clothed, wendy loosens mike's belt, showing
no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top
of her for a dry hump.

just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the
stairs -- ben towers above them, looking down.

mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together,
grabbing a tv guide as wendy stands up, the mask still on.

as ben descends mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his
pants, pretends to flip through the tv guide.

			mikey
		(muttering)
	when worlds collide.

			wendy 
	huh?

			mikey 
	4:30 movie. when worlds collide.

ben arrives, folds his arms.

			ben 
	what the hell are you kids doing
	down here?

			wendy 
	what do you think we're doing, dad?

			ben 
	what do i think? i think you're
	probably touching each other. i
	think you're touching that reckless
	jerk-off, for god's sake, and i
	think he's trying to get into your
	slacks. i think, at fourteen years
	of age, that you're getting ready
	to give up your girlhood --

			mikey 
	hey, hang on there, mr. hood --

			ben 
	don't you direct a single word at
	me, mikey. i don't want to hear it.
	i'll be speaking with your parents
	about this situation very soon. bet
	your ass on that, son. young lady?

			wendy 
	talking to me, dad?

			ben 
	who else would i be talking to? and
	take that thing off!

			wendy
		(pulling off the mask)
	well, then forget all this stern
	dad stuff.

			ben 
	i'm not interested in your smart
	ass remarks now, lady. let's go.
	right now. you and i can discuss it
	on the walk home.

she stands next to mikey for a moment, both on the verge of
tears.
