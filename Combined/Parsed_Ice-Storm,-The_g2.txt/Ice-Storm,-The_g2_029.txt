group of men, which includes george clair, mid-thirties,
unctuously handsome.

	but what, exactly, is stagflation,
	this mixture of inflation and
	stagnation, and how should we in
	the securities industry understand
	and accommodate it? well -- and i
	hope i'm not out of bounds here -
	think of the money supply as a
	large male organ, continuously
	inflating, and yet, the societal
	vaginal cavity simply wants more.
	as the vicious circle of higher
	returns without real satisfaction
	continues, the money-organ may seem
	to be in demand, but in fact even
	the most inflated capital is
	unwanted. this is why i suggest
	that while we engage this mawing
	abyss for the highest returns, we
	at the same time fantasize, so to
	speak, of the safe harbor of
	capital appreciation.

the aging boss nods agreement.

		(more or less mumbling)
	brilliant, brilliant.

george clair just grins.
