elena and wendy come out the front door, as ben lays mikey's
body onto the ground before the front steps.

			elena 
	ben?

he's too breathless to speak.

they stand there, looking down at mikey.

behind elena and wendy, jim appears.

he pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.

			ben
	jim -- he was just up --  in silver
	lane -- i think maybe -- a power
	line --

jim picks up his son.

he carries him silently into the house.

sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back
against the wall as they pass, without expression.

after a moment, from outside, the hoods can hear jim's
wailing.

			ben 
	do you think? maybe we should call
	someone --

			elena 
	the phone's out.

			ben (cont'd)
	yeah. well, we can just --

			elena 
	ben, i don't think he wants us
	here.

wendy has been watching sandy through the screen door.

			wendy 
	wait, i --

she turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --
