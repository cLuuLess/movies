int. school party. night

paul, francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room.
various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm
style undanceable rock (jethro tull, etc.) francis hands paul
the tail end of a joint, but paul waves it away.

			paul 
	no more man. i'm about to drop as
	it is.

			francis 
	see ya.

			paul 
	where you going?

			francis 
	paul, let me enlighten you about
	something.
	you and i exist on two opposite
	sides of a great existential
	divide, that being your pathetic
	virginity on the one hand and my
	astonishing number of sexual
	conquests on the other. i'm off to
	get laid. see you.

			paul 
	flame on, asshole.

			francis 
	and remember, with your erogenous
	zones lubricated as such with the
	mighty herb, do not attempt
	terrestrial contact with members of
	the opposite sex -- because you
	drone on like a motherfucker when
	you're stoned.

he waves his fingers toward paul's eyes, in the classic
"stoned" gesture, then wanders off.

paul looks on at the gathering. marge waves to him from the
dance floor.
