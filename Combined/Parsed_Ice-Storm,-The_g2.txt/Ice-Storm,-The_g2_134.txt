sidles up next to him.

	as the indian saying goes, pain is
	merely an opinion.

		(nodding across the room)
	hey -- check it out. maria conrad's
	brought her son.

	i wish some of the gang had brought
	their daughters!

ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke.

he looks across the room as maria and her son neil (stringy
hair, acne, tie-dyed turtleneck, patched jeans) are engaging
janey and philip edwards in conversation.
