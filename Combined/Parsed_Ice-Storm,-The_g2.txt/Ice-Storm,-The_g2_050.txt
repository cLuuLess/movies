int. williams bedroom. night

janey is reading, still dressed, on the bed. she nods to jim
as he enters with his suitcase.

			janey 
	good trip?

he nods and puts his suitcase down, then sits heavily on the
side of the bed.

			jim
		(as he sits)
	you bet.

it turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a wave
that nearly pushes janey off her edge of the bed.

			janey 
	jesus, jim!

			jim
		(jumping up, which only
		 creates another wave)
	sorry honey. hell, we've got to
	trade this thing in for a normal
	bed.

			janey 
	just be careful.

			jim
		(as he begins to unpack)
	you notice anything with mikey
	lately? the kid seemed a little out
	of it tonight, eh?

			janey 
	tonight? jim, he's been out of it
	since he was born.

			jim 
	hell, i guess he takes after me,
	huh?

he laughs to himself.

she gives him a look.
