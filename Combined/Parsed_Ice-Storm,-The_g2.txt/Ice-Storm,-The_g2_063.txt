int. five and dime. day

elena moves through the aisles, putting various sundries into
a basket.

she pauses in front of the lipsticks.

she picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it
in her pocket.

we see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle,
as she quickly exits the store.

the middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave.
