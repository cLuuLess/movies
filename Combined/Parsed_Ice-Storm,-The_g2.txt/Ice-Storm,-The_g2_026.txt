int. hood bedroom. night

elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of
the bed. we hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and
see ben emerge in his boxers. he pauses in front of the bed,
looking at elena.

			elena
		(without opening her eyes)
	you're staring at me.

			ben 
	i wasn't star--

			elena 
	i've been thinking, ben, about
	wendy. i was going to ask if she'd
	come with me sometime to meet dr.
	woolens.

			ben 
	that shrink -- the one you always
	wanted me to see? i thought you
	dropped him.

			elena 
	i did, but -- somebody should
	probably see her, talk to her...
	you think she's ok?

			ben 
	why shouldn't she be?

elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry.

			ben (cont'd)
		(pause)
	then again, why should she be? i
	mean with us, with our...

			elena 
	so maybe you'll come too?

			ben 
	oh not again elena! if we've got
	problems, why can't you just come
	out and talk about them.

			elena 
	it's you ben who needs to talk.
	i've had my say, and i'm waiting to
	hear back from you.

			ben 
	yeah but elena, even you don't
	believe all that "i'm ok. you're
	ok" stuff you keep babbling about --
	you say so yourself. i've been all
	ears for about ten years now on his
	subject, and --

			elena 
	-- and you haven't moved out yet.
	it's because you're too lazy, ben.
	too scared or lazy to either deal
	with us or simply make a decision --

			ben 
	elena.

silence.

			elena 
		(sighing)
	sleep in the study? please.

ben picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at the
door.

			ben 
	good night.

			elena 
	good night.
