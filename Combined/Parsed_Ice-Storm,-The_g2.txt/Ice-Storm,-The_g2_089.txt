the car pulls up. paul gets out, looking shell-shocked. he
sees wendy waving to him from a second floor window. he nods
back.

			ben 
	um, paul. on second thought, can
	you do me a favor and pretend i
	never said any of that.

			paul 
	sure dad.

			ben 
	thanks.

in the doorway, elena waits.
