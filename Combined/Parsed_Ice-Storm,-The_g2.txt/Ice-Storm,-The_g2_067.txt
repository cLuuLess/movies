ext. hood backyard. day

janey comes around the back to discover sandy stuffing a
model airplane with m-80 firecrackers. he lights them and
runs back a safe distance. the plane explodes, its wreckage
joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys.

			janey 
	sandy!

sandy looks up -- busted.

janey marches over to him.

			janey (cont'd)
	you little idiotic prick, you could
	blow yourself fucking sky high with
	all this demented crap.

sandy looks on the verge of tears. she softens and bends down
to him.

			janey (cont'd)
		(sighing)
	hey.
		(picking up the
		 firecrackers)
	i'll take this stuff.

			sandy
	you going to tell dad?

			janey
	would it matter?
		(sees something else lying
		 on the ground)
	and what's that?

			sandy
		(sniffling)
	you know, it's the whip -- the one
	uncle frank got me from mexico.

			janey
	it's not packed with explosives, is
	it?

			sandy 
	no!

			janey
		(going into the house)
	play with the whip.
