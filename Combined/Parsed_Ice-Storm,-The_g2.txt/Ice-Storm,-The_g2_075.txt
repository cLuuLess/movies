int. williams bathroom. day

wendy flips up her dress for sandy.

he slowly unzips, his hand unsteady. we can tell from the
look on wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the
little guy.

suddenly sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears.

			sandy 
	what do you want?! what do you
	want? get out! get out of here!

the door flips open -- and janey williams appears.

			janey
		(sizing up the situation) 
	shit.
