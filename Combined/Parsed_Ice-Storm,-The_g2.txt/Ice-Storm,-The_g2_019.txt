	and to think -- they met at a key
	party of all things.

			elena 
	a key party?

			dorothy 
	you know, it's a california thing.
	that scuzzy husband of hers dragged
	her kicking and screaming to one
	when they were out in l.a. you
	know, the men put their car keys in
	a bowl, and then at the end of the
	evening the women line up and fish
	them out and go home with whoever's
	keys they've got. anyhow that's how
	she met this rod person or whatever
	his name is and he's left his wife
	and she's packing for california.
	irwin is devastated. it's so
	ironic.

			janey
	ironic? 

			dorothy
		(caught out)
	well, um, yes. ironic. his name is
	rod.
