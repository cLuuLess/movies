int. school music room. day

band practice. the new canaan high school band is doing a
wind version of a popular rock tune.

in front, there's wendy, in halter top and hip-hugging bell
bottoms, incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this
being her one stab at extracurricular activities.

in the flute section directly behind her is sandy, piping
away on a tiny piccolo. he sits on a riser slightly elevated
above her.

he directs downward at wendy a protracted regard, a look of
intense concentration on his face.

sandy's pov:

wendy's backside, her pants pushed outward in the back,
affording sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum
crack.

push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape,
then back to sandy's furrowed face.
