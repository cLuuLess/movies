int. five and dime store. day

wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the
aisles, arriving at the candy selection.

she looks around.

she takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the
oversized pockets of her painter's pants.

she turns around, and her breath goes out of her -- an old
woman has been watching her shoplift. the woman looks sadly
at her, but says nothing. wendy slowly walks past her and out
the back door of the store. the woman looks on.
