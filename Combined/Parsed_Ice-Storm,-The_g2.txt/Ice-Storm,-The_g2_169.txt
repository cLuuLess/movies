	phone's out. i hope the pipe's --

he walks into the kitchen. the pipes have begun to burst.
there's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle
on the floor.

elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. she leans
against the counter, picking up the garter belt without
thinking for a second, then putting it back down.

			jim 
	oh well. why don't you put on some
	dry socks -- and we've got some
	rain boots in the guest closet back
	there. last room upstairs -- back
	of the hall.

elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.
