int. coffee shop. day

elena and philip are seated at a booth.

			philip
	it's been a tremendously
	transformative year -- maybe a
	little controversial of course, but
	we're breaking down the old
	unitarian barriers --

			elena 
	i suppose my reluctance was the
	group aspect of it -- i've never
	been much of a joiner, although i
	still consider myself a somewhat
	religious person --

			philip 
	well i of course flatter myself
	that our church is not exactly what
	most people would call organized
	religion -- at times it's the
	disorganization that's liberating --
	and of course i've begun to
	minister much more in what one
	might call therapeutic
	environments, in small groups, and
	one on one, couples --

elena looks outside the window, and sees wendy speed past on
her bicycle.

			elena 
		(cutting him off)
	my daughter. i haven't been on a
	bike for years.
		(still not really looking
		 at him)
	when was the last time you rode a
	bike?

			philip
		(a bit taken aback by the
		 abrupt topic change)
	they say you never forget.

			elena
		(jarred back to his
		 presence) 
	forget what?

			philip 
	forget how to ride a bike.

silence.

			elena 
	no, of course you don't, you're
	right.
