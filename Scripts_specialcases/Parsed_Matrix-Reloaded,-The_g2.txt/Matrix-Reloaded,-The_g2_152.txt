int. penthouse apartment (matrix) - night

the apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. gregory sits on a
leather couch, watching  whatever on the  tube with the  sound off. he
absentmindedly  manipulates a  quarter over  and around  his fingers.
finally, he stops and looks at the quarter.

holding it between his  thumb and forefinger, he  folds it in half  as
though it was a disk of bubble  gum. he folds it again, then rools  it
as though its a musket ball.

chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. she reaches
points the remote at the tv, but gregory puts his hand over it to  get
her attention.

                               gregory

        "so, you really dont have any idea how you got here?"

                               chandra

               "no. i only remember being on the bike."

                            gregory sighs.

                               gregory

 "yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. do you know how we
                           got this place?"

                      she looks at him, annoyed.

                               chandra

            "duh. we broke in. we dont own a penthouse."

                               gregory

                       "what if i said we did?"

                               chandra

                       "id say youre insane."

she finally gets the remote and changes the channel. the volume  comes
on, louder and  infinitely more tinny  and obnoxious than  anything in
life. chandra laughs at the images as gregory stares into space.
