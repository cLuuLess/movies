int. burnt-out cathedral (matrix) - night

neo sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring  ahead.
hes  in the  belfry of  an ancient,  destroyed cathedral,  among the
pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap.

from here, in  downtown, we can  see the modern,  uptown section, with
its  gleaming  skyscrapers. metacortex  still  stands, illuminated  by
searchlights.

neo sits and broods. isolated, his world turned upside down and  right
side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank.

again, he tries his cell phone.  static. he collapses it and puts  it.
just as it leaves his mind, it rings. the face flips open.

neo puts it to his ear without speaking.

                           morpheus (o.s.)

                                "neo."

              neos grim expression is melted by relief.

                                 neo

       "morpheus! holy shit! you wont believe what happened."

                               morpheus

                              "i know."

                                 neo

           "i couldnt do it. morpheus, theres a problem."
