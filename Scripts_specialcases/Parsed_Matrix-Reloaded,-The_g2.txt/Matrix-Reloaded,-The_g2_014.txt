ext. zion street

it's like a  valley floor running  between two gigantic  walls of rock
that are  nearly vertical,  coming together  in an  elongated archway.
carved into the street level  are innumerable stores and shops,  above
them,  apartments and  balconies that  rise to  the top  of the  arch.
people  flow  through the  street.  their clothes  are  homespun wool,
denim, and leather. dyes and  color are absent. carved into  the solid
granite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are
intricate and beautiful carvings.

neo is lead down  the street by choi,  dujour, and trinity, and  a few
other rebels. the push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity
melting into one race.

                                 choi

"see, man? this is home. this is the main street. one of em, anyway.
       almost everyone is a fighter. sometimes, even the kids.

 they pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small
                              machines.

                                 choi

 "our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. check it out,
                      here are some newcomers."

  a group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them. they look at
          neo, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer.

                                 neo

                     "where did they come from?"

                                 choi

     "energy plant we raided on our last mission. there were some
                             survivors."

                                 neo

             "how are their minds freed from the matrix?"

                               trinity

                          "with difficulty."

                                dujour

                             "if at all."

they step into a club, dead  duck. its a sailor joint. lots  of wood,
beer on tap, and rum. crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels,
greeting them, as they eye neo.  they take a booth in the  corner. the
waitress arrives.

                               waitress

        "welcome home, brothers and sisters. first day back?"

                                 choi

                            "yes, lovely."

                               waitress

                   "on the house, then. four rums?"

                               trinity

                           "make it eight."

        the waitress smirks and leaves. trinity turns to choi.

                               trinity

                          "any casualties?"

                   choi lights up and takes a drag.

                                 choi

                  "two. sidewinder and left-right."

                                dujour

              "i cant believe cypher turned. bastard."



                                 choi

                        "he who loses faith..."

                                dujour

  "neo, we monitored your fight. did you really gain enlightenment?"

                             neo shrugs.

                                 neo

                "all i know is i kicked smiths ass."

                                 choi

"fuckin finally, jesus christ. its about time we iced that bastard."

                                dujour

               "yeah, we finally won against an agent?"

                                 choi

             "i guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh?"

               the drinks arrive. tall glasses of rum.

    choi holds his glass aloft. they raise their glasses to toast.

                                 choi

                         "live free or die."

                            all (save neo)

                             "live free."

they slam the rum back, and  slam empty glasses on the table.  neo can
barely manage to sip his.

                                 neo

                      "god, how do you do that?"

                               trinity

                     "youve never drank before."

                                dujour

                           "not for real."

                                 choi

             "you want to know what being the one means?"

                                 neo

                               "what?"

                                 choi

                    "one drink and youre toast."

                                dujour


             "neo, you know what else youve never done?"

she glances at  trinity, who falls  back against the  seat, turning to
suppress a smile. choi cracks up.

                                 neo

                               "yeah."

                                dujour

                    "yeah, youve never done it."

                                 choi

       "and virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count."

                                 neo

                     "well. ill drink to that."

                                 choi

                            "here, here."

this time, neo follows the others and slams back the entire glass.  he
coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on."
