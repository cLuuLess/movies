ext. metacortex plaza


smith stands, facing neo, about two fighting distances away.

neos  concentration is  broken. the  metacortex building  comes to  a
shuddering halt.

                                 neo

                            "youre back."

cu: smith

                               he nods.

                                 neo

                    "and you have a ponytail now."

as we concentrate  on neo, and  he concentrates on  smith, we can  see
more black suits marching up behind him.

neo attacks smith. smith backs away slowly, blocking against a  losing
battle and taking hits. meanwhile,  the men in black converge  on neo.
just as neo  lands a smashing  blow on smiths  chin, three voices  at
once shout:

                                "hey!"

neo turns,  and smith  pushes him  hard in  the opposite  direction to
face:

three smiths! they attack at once, one going low and hard with a  knee
breaking sweep kick, the other punching neo in the face, and the third
breaking to the  side and putting  his toe into  neos stomach with  a
vicious side-kick.

they attack  is in  perfect synch,  eight arms  and eight legs working
like clockwork, striking  their target without  getting in the  way of
each other. the attack slams neo back, right into the first,  bloodied
smith. neo slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he  backed
into a  brick wall.  agent smith  grabs him  and holds  him in  a full
nelson, exposing him  to his three  copies. the copies  shift position
and attack again. two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with
their combined arms slam neo in the face, then step apart as the third
comes in. the third  grabs the shoulders of  the other two and  flips,
walking his loafers up neos  body, and kicking him from  below, right
up into  the chin  of his  jaw! it  snaps neos  back with  a spray of
blood.
