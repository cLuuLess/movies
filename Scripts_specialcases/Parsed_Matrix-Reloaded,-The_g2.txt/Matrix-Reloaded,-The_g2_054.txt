int. main deck

morpheus, neo, trinity, choi, and  niobe are on the chairs  as theyre
being jacked in by circa and razor.

cut to: razor jumps in the  operators chair, his hands blur over  the
touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the matrix.

                           morpheus (o.s.)

            "were going straight for the throat, people."

angle on: razor and circa  typing like made at their  keyboards. razor
hits the enter  key. they look  on, transfixed with  anticipation. the
screaming matrix code grinds to a readable halt. the slap each others
hands and continue hacking.

                           morpheus (o.s.)

"we have the advantage of surprise. they wont expect us to return so
                                soon."
