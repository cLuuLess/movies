gregory bursts over the hill, holding hands with chandra as they  run.
hes only had  time to through  on his boots  and boxers and  grab his
.44. chandra is  dressed only in  her underwear and  gregorys leather
jacket.

                               gregory

            "wake up! get on your bikes and fucking ride!"

his gang burst to their feet. they scramble through the dunes, heading
for their bikes.

a helicopter, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and  the
wind from its  rotors blowing sand  everywhere, flies up  and over the
dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet.

gregory mounts his bike and chandra jumps on back. with a wave of  his
hand, all  the bikes,  his included,  drop into  neutral and  rev into
start. their  headlights blaze  as the  helicopter returns,  joined by
another.

                         chopper loudspeaker

       "this is the police, stop your vehicles and surrender!"

suddenly, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. a  bullet
trail stitches its way  across a pair of  bikers, sending them to  the
ground as the helicopters fly overhead.

gregory cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.
