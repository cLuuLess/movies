int. apartment building (matrix) - day

the building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that
no sane person could find attractive. the humble place is home to  the
oracle.

neo exits an  elevator. recomposed and  dressed normally, he  walks up
and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.

a tall black woman, one of the oracles priestesses, comes out of  the
stairwell and recognizes neo.

                              priestess

                                "neo."

he turns  and looks  at her.  she smiles,  but as  neo looks at her, a
flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the
smile returns.

                              priestess

                 "the oracle is anxious to see you."

neo follows her into the familiar apartment. the windows are  covered,
and neo and the priestess are the only ones there. the priestess moves
into the dark kitchen.

neos eyes  adjust to  the darkness.  he hears  something squish as he
steps, and looks down.

the tattered rug  is a swamp  of dark, congealing  liquid. neo reaches
down and touches it with his fingertips. its half-dried blood.

he stands, his eyes adjusted to  the dark now. the walls are  chipped,
covered in bullet holes.

in slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. in walks  agent
brown. neo turns to the  kitchen. agents smith and jones  appear. they
all draw their .45s.

neo stands  still as  they walk  up to  him and  put their guns to his
head.

                         agent smith scoffs.

                                 neo

 "i was on to you the whole time. i only came in here to isolate you,
                           to destroy you."

                             agent jones

                     "what are you waiting for?"

                                 neo

              "i realized, that i cant destroy you - "

                           he nods at smith

                                 neo

              " - without destroying the matrix itself."

                                smith

                 "you killed me too easy last time."

                                brown

                       "and if you kill us - "

                           he nods at jones

                                brown

                   "well only come back like him."

                         brown nods to smith.

                                 neo

                              "i know."

   smith breathes deep, and drops his gun. the others follow suit.

                                smith

                "so, why dont you take it all down?"

                                 neo

                            "the matrix?"

                                smith

                                "yes."

                                 neo

  "i can. but if i destroy the matrix, everyone within it will die."

                            smith snorts.

                                smith

        "i take it the great morpheus failed to mention this?"

       neo looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.

                                 neo

                     "how many people are in it?"

        smith holsters his weapon. he speaks matter-of-factly.

                                smith

                      "six and a half billion."

            for neo, the numbers are too huge to imagine.

                            brown scoffs.

                                brown

                      "could you destroy us?"

its a serious question for neo. but he nods. he knows his potential.

                                 neo

                              "i could."

                                smith

              "what does that make you feel like? god?"

                      he is amused by the idea.

                                jones

        "this is getting tiresome. where do we go from here?"

                                 neo

 "if you cut the power that the matrix supplies to your armies, ill
                            let you live."

                                smith

      "idiot. we dont care about life, we care about victory."

                                 neo

                                "why?"

                                jones


                       "so our kind... prevails."

                                 neo

                          "you mean, lives."

                                smith

 "who do you think started this war, boy? your kind tried to kill us
                               first."

                                brown

         "but you didnt. youre not as tough as you think."

                                 neo

                             "well see."

the three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door
of the apartment. neo opens it,  and stops, his face meeting a  flying
fist. his vision  flashes with the  impact, and he  staggers back into
the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.

              gregor steps into the room, tall and bad.

                         neo holds up a hand.

                                 neo

           "stop! i dont want to fight you! youre human!"

gregory  doesnt  answer.  he  smashes  a  side-kick  into  neos gut,
doubling him over.

the kick carries  such an impact  that a pale  concussion wave flashes
past gregor. it sends neo crashing out the window.

gregory stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the  three
agents. theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below.

the building  starts trembling.  we hear  rapid-fire impacts,  growing
louder and coming faster.

the floor explodes  as neo crashes  up through the  concrete, throwing
the agents away as  he embraces gregory in  a bear hug. they  blast up
through the ceiling. we follow them up through three more floors, bam,
bam, bam. each concrete floor smashes gregory in the head.
