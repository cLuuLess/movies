                 morpheus holds his celly to his ear.

                             circa (o.s.)

                        "and have a nice day."

        he drops the phone into his pocket. they turn to him.

                               morpheus

"niobe, youre the liasion to our operators. neo, what do you have for
                            a game plan?"

                                 neo

                      "where is the mainframe?"

                               morpheus

                      "the metacortex building."

                           neos jaw drops.

                                 neo

               "what the fuck? thats where i worked."

                                 choi

 "and what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video
                games? you were working for the man."

                               trinity

   "its true, neo. metacortex employs humans to write code for the
                               matrix."

                                 neo

           "i thought i was working on a fucking database."

                               morpheus

  "they keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing.
 thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people. but, that
                           doesnt matter."

                            neo recovers.

                                 neo

"how bout this? i just walk up to the metacortex building and blow it
                                 up?"

                             choi laughs.

                                 choi

                      "what, by power of will?"

        neo nods. chois smile fades. he looks to the others.

                                 choi

                         "hes joking right?"

                      morpheus shakes his head.

                               morpheus

"well fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. if youre
able to accomplish this mission, well phase back into the ship. stay
 in contact. if you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately."
