ext. plaza

neo reaches back and puts his hands on either side of smiths head. as
hes  being pummeled  from the  front, he  squeezes and  screams. his
screams are mixed with smiths. the agents head deforms as were hear
a sickening  crack. suddenly,  the body  reverts back  to that  of the
original owner, a security guard, and the head simply explodes.

the  hold broken,  neo stumbles  back over  the body,  with the  three
smiths in pursuit. he somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps  to
the left, putting one smith in front of the other two. he attacks, his
killing blows destroying smith, smashing through his blocks. he falls,
and neo takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of
them away in one shot.

as he comes  down, a wall  of smiths converges  from all sides.  they
stop, leaving a circle around him.

we pan back to view a sea of black-suited smiths flooding the plaza.

cu: neo

as  his hand  passes over  his face,  it is  refreshed, anew,  perfect
again. he surveys the wall-to-wall smiths.

smith talks with his voice, times a thousand.

                                smith

       "neo, leave the matrix. you know not what youre doing."

                                 neo

                        "well, is that right?"

he turns  to the  metacortex building.  its repairing,  growing steel
girders and concrete skin.

                         neos face darkens.

                                 neo

                                "no!"

reality shimmers as  his anger strikes  out at the  building. the tops
floors burn, and then explode.  the explosion rips down the  building,
slowing, slowing, then stopping.

thousands of smiths  are gazing up  at the building,  concentrating on
combating neos attack.
