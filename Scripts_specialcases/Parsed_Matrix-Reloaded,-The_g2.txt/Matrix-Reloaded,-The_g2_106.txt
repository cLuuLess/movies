int. empty building

choi and trinity hide  in the shadows of  an empty room, watching  the
battle. trinitys cell rings. she answers silently.

                           morpheus (v.o.)

                       "lets go. laxe three."

                               trinity

                          "what about neo?"

                           morpheus (v.o.)

     "we can do nothing to help him. well only get in his way."

                         they leave the room.
