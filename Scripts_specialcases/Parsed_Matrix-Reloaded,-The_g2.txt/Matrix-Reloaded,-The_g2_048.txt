ext. desert (day)

from far away, we see gregory and chandra hiding under the only bit of
shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. we sail in  and
cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto  chandras
feet, clad in gregorys boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs.
shes collapsed onto gregory. hes in equally bad shape. gregory leans
with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he  drifts
in and out of sleep.

                             gregory pov

he  stars at  the horizon  and the  mirages of  water reflecting  the
jaundiced yellow sky. in the  shimmering distance, a man appears,  but
gregorys lids  shut and  we see  darkness. when  he reopens them, the
figure is more clear. its a man, dressed in a black suit. even in the
distance we can recognize him. we want it to be him.
