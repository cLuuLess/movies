ext. plaza

its a sea of the dead. from its center, neo emerges, soaked in blood,
gagging and  gasping for  breath. he  stumbles over  them. shocked and
crazed, he glimpses the metacortex building. its in one piece  again,
unharmed.

he falls against  a smashed corporate  art sculpture. he  picks a cell
phone up from the ground and dials.

                                 neo

                         "morpheus, pick up."

we hear nothing but static.  disgusted, neo throws the phone  away. he
falls against the sculpture and looks up. coming around the corner  of
the building is a group of agents and soldiers.

neo  sinks down,  staring at  his hands.  he catches  his breath  and
concentrates.  the  blood  disappears,  and he  dons  the  suit  of an
anonymous soldier in black. his face, too, seems to change.

he stands and walks away. we only see his back.
