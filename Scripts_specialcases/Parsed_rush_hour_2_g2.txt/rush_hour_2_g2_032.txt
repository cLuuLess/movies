	int. taxi - evening

	the cab driver turns to carter, who motions to the limo.

				carter
			(loud)
		follow that limo.

	the cab driver continues to stare at carter.

				carter (cont'd)
		you understand what i'm saying?  follow
		that car!  where it goes, you go!  this
		is a chase -- we are chasing that limo!
			(beat)
		we are still parked -- we're not moving! 
		this is the opposite of chasing -- drive
		the car or i will kill you!

	the driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  carter fishes
	in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash.

				cab driver
		now you speak my language.
