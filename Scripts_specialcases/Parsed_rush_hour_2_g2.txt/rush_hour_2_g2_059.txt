	lee and carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through
	the street trying their best to look like secret service
	agents.  they approach carter's parked vette.

				carter
		secret service agent carter.  this is my
		calling, lee. 
		give me six months and i'll be in
		washington protecting a white guy.

				lee
		we both know you would never take a
		bullet for someone else.

				carter
		they don't know that.  what are they
		gonna do, try and shoot the president
		during the interview?  i'll bet isabella
		can pull some strings.  you saw the way
		she was staring at me.

				lee
		she never even looked at you.

				carter
		you're just jealous 'cos the girl picked
		me.  i'm tall, dark and handsome, you're
		third world ugly.

				lee
		i am not third world ugly.  women like
		me, they think i'm cute.  like snoopy.

				carter
		snoopy is about six inches taller than
		you.  i'm sorry, lee, you never had a
		chance.

	carter's had the last word, he gets into the vette.  lee
	reluctantly gets in, too.
