	int. hallway - night

	lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the
	walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room.

	he hears noise, two security guards coming behind him through
	the casino door.  he has no choice but to crawl over the back
	of a money cart and hug the top.  he lies as still as he can,
	trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring
	directly into the eye in the sky cameras that are in the
	ceiling.

	we see lee's face

	as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the
	words "oh shit" as he rolls by.

	lee looks to his left, sees the soft count room -- a mountain
	of counterfeit superbills that are waiting to be paid out. 
	on the opposite side, the real money is being wheeled out
	toward a waiting truck that is parked at the back door.

	lee sees two more cameras in the ceiling, knows his cover is
	blown.  he jumps down off the cart, is standing in front of
	the locked vault.  there's no way to get the plates. 
	isabella has set him up again.

	he turns and smiles at the confused security guards.

				lee
		hi.  how's it going?  you guys have
		change for a twenty?

	the guards make their move.  and lee starts to fight them
	down the hall, using the cart as a shield as he rams into two
	more guards, fights them off as he turns the corner toward
	the casino door -- but he gets slammed to the ground by a
	right cross.

	hu li threw the punch, a roll of quarters in her hand as she
	stands over him with five triad soldiers.  she holds a knife
	to lee's throat.

				hu li
			(in chinese)
		open your mouth.

	she puts the small grenade in lee's mouth, tapes it shut. 
	she holds the detonator in her hand.

				hu li (cont'd)
			(continuing in chinese)
		that's a ying-tao grenade, inspector. 
		please follow me or i'll blow 32 teeth
		into your brain.
