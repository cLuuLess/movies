				ricky tan
		despite what people suspect...what you
		suspect --

				lee
		don't.

	ricky tan hears the steel in lee's voice, acknowledges it.

				ricky tan
		... if your father were alive, i would
		be turning to him now.
			(beat)
		i didn't blow up the american embassy,
		but i believe some of my people did.  my
		enemies are trying to frame me.
			(beat)
		there is a war going on within the
		triads -- and i am going to lose.  my
		name has been written into the book of
		death.

				lee
		the police can protect you.

				ricky tan
		nobody can protect me.  i'll make a deal
		with you, lee.  but only iff you'll get
		me out of hong kong.

				lee
		tell me why they killed the customs
		agents.

				ricky tan
		there is a ship, in the hong kong
		harbor...

	hu li bursts onto the deck, flanked by four bodyguards.

	ricky tan screams something at hu li in chinese.  hu li
	screams back as she empties her gun into ricky's chest.  tan
	falls back, over the rail, and into the water.

	lee moves towards hu li, but the four bodyguards are on lee,
	attacking from all sides.  hu li exits as lee tries to fight
	off the bodyguards.
