	int. penthouse suite - night

	lee and carter are looking down at the street, both relieved
	it's finally over.  carter puts his hand on lee's shoulder.

				carter
		i don't know about you, but i need a
		wine cooler.

	as they turn to the door -- hu li is walking toward them,
	bleeding and half-dead.  she has another bomb in her hand. 
	this one twice the size of the one from earlier.

				hu li
			(in chinese)
		we'll go together, inspector.

				carter
		please tell me she just asked for a ride
		to the airport.

	hu li hits the switch - starts to smile.  lee and carter turn
	and run for the open window.
