	ricky tan turns to hu li.

				ricky tan
		chai hu li.
			("little fox")
		have fun.

	ricky tan walks out.  hu li holds the detonator up to lee,
	plays with the button.

				hu li
			(in chinese)
		in a few minutes...you'll beg me to push
		this button.

	hu li pulls her knife, moves towards lee.  she holds the
	blade to his face.  about to cut him.  when isabella pulls
	her gun.

	isabella walks toward lee, whose hands are still tied behind
	his back.  hu li clutches the detonator in one hand, her
	knife in the other.  she takes a step toward isabella.

				isabella
		it's time to end this, inspector.

	isabella cocks the gun, spins back and kicks the detonator
	from hu li's hand -- slamming her against the wall and
	sticking the gun under her chin.

				isabella (cont'd)
		don't move!  united states secret
		service.

	hu li whips her knife around, catches isabella across the
	hand -- the gun sliding across the room near the detonator --
	the two women fight around it.

	lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and
	rolls toward the detonator.  he's about to grab it when:

	the triads open the door

	they're about to move in.

				hu li
		get the detonator!

	the triads go for the detonator -- as lee gets to his feet,
	kicks hu li's legs out from under her.

	one of the triads about to pick up the detonator - but lee
	gets to him first.  he fights with one hand tied behind his
	back.

	hu li and isabella fight it out in the eye in the sky room.

	lee gets kicked towards the eye in the sky window.
