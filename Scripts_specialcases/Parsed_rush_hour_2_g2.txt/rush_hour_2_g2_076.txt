	the truck is parked in the underground loading docks.  it's
	approached by four triad soldiers.  soldier #1 opens the
	truck's double doors to find.

	lee and carter are gone.  except for boxes of money, the
	truck bed is empty.

	two soldiers enter the truck bed.

	angle up to reveal

	lee and carter wedged up against the ceiling of the truck
	bed.  above the doors and over the soldiers.

	lee and carter swing down in unison -- knocking both soldiers
	to the ground.  in the next instant:

	on lee

	still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips
	onto the roof of the truck.

	on carter

	who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to
	use a shield as gunfire erupts.

	lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the
	ground.  he then grabs the guard carter is using as a shield
	and together they swing him into the truck -- knocking down
	the first two guards.

	carter and lee slam the back doors shut -- bolting them
	closed and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like
	the closest way out:

	a large open pipe on the side of the tunnel.
