	int. courtyard pathway - continuous

	lee and master fu walking.

				lee
		i need your help, master.  i'm seeking a
		man who used to train with you.  he's
		become a killer - the worst kind of
		animal.

				master fu
		animals kill only from hunger or fear. 
		the man you seek is lower than a
		serpent.  
			(faces lee)
		...he kills for money.

	in the b.g., we see the kids leaping acrobatically over
	carter from all sides.  carter, frustrated, tries to grab the
	kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him.  they
	disappear o.s.

	lee and master fu walk another moment, master fu lost in
	thought.

				master fu (cont'd)
		he was the best i ever trained, you
		know.

				lee
		ricky tan?

				master fu
		no.  your father.
			(lee reacts)
		your father and ricky tan were my
		favorite students... and for such awful
		things to happen as they did --

	lee cuts off master fu's reminisces -- he's obviously
	uncomfortable.

				lee
		how do i find ricky tan?

	again in the b.g., carter and the flying kids go zipping by
	in the other direction, disappear o.s.

	master fu pats the soil around a struggling plant.

				master fu
		a seeding spends its entire life
		reaching towards heaven.

				lee
		i know, master, but...

				master fu
		the answers you seek can be found in
		heaven on earth.

				lee
		heaven on earth?  master, i don't
		understand.
			(working it)
		a temple, where heaven is on earth?  a
		mountain, where earth reaches for the --

				master fu
		it's a massage parlor downtown.  "heaven
		on earth."  you will find your answers
		there.

	lee bows to master fu, slowly turns to walk back down the
	pathway.

				master fu (cont'd)
		wait!  put a c-note in the jar.

	lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway. 
	master fu walks over and takes the cash.

				master fu (cont'd)
		cheap bastard...
