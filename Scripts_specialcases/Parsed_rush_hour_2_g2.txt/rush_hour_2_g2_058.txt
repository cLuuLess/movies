	int. isabella's suite - later

				isabella
			(she locks the door)
		look, i've been working this case for
		months now...

				carter
		so what's your story?

				isabella
		they think i'm a crooked customs agent.

	lee examines the stack of hundred dollar bills from hu li's
	package.  carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the
	food from the mini fridge.

				lee
		is this a payoff?

				isabella
		no.  it's a sample.  you guys ever heard
		of the superbill?

				carter
		it's a myth.  some kind of counterfeit.

				isabella
		it's much more than a counterfeit.  14
		out of 15 world banks can't tell the
		difference.  the paper is crane linen
		blend -- and the bills are printed on
		u.s. intaglio presses.

				carter
		how're they getting into the u.s. mint
		to use the presses?

				isabella
		in 1959, the united states was very
		friendly with the shah of iran.  we
		wanted his oil, so for the shah's
		birthday, the government gave him a gift
		-- a u.s. treasury intaglio press.  the
		only one to ever leave the country. 
		five years ago ricky tan bought that
		press on the black market.

				lee
		five years ago?!  
			(beat)
		that's right before he left the force.

	lee and carter exchange looks.

				isabella
		it wasn't hard to spot the fakes until
		this past year.  then tan got hold of
		one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar
		plates -- and started making superbills.

				lee
			(understanding)
		and hu li killed him for the plates.

				isabella
		yes.  they've printed and shipped one
		hundred million dollars, and there's
		only one way to spot a fake.

	isabella lights a hundred dollar bill on fire, and it burns
	red.

				isabella (cont'd)
		they use an optical transfer ink from
		india that burns red -- the real ink
		burns black.

				carter
		what the hell are they going to do with
		a hundred million dollars in funny
		money?

				isabella
		the real question is, where are the
		plates?  if we can find the plates, we
		can stop the whole operation.

	isabella thinks for a beat.

				isabella (cont'd)
		maybe that's where you can help us. 
		carter, this is your city, right?

	carter nods.

				isabella (cont'd)
		and lee, you know hu li and the triads?

	lee nods.

				isabella (cont'd)
		okay, find out where hu li's keeping the
		plates.
			(hands lee a card with a phone
			 number)
		welcome aboard, gentlemen.  from this
		moment on, you're working for the united
		states secret service.

	isabella opens the door to let lee and carter out.  they exit
	quickly, trying to hide their excitement.  camera stays on
	isabella as she takes out her cell phone, punches in a
	number.

				sterling (o.s.)
		sterling.

				isabella
		lee and carter are officially out of the
		secret service's way...
