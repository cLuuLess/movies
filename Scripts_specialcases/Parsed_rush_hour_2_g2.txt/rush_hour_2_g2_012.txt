	ext. roof - continuous

	lee pulls himself up onto the roof, takes a few steps when
	wham!  he is clocked by a 16-foot bamboo pole.  lee topples
	over the edge!  we see his adversary for the first time.

	hu li - agile, gorgeous...dangerous

	as she steps to the edge... boom!  the stairwell door flies
	open and carter emerges.  gun low and ready.  hu li is gone.

				carter
			(out of breath)
		freeze!  nobody move!

	carter goes to the edge and sees lee hanging on a pole below. 
	carter is blind-sided by hu li.

	she takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel
	and windmills a hard kick that sends carter flying off the
	roof!

	he falls along the side of the building.  he manages to grab
	the end of a bamboo pole that juts out from the scaffolding.

	lee is right there next to him!

	they're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives.  hu
	li looks down at them.  she has no weapon to finish them off. 
	she turns and runs, disappearing in the night.

	carter and lee

	holding on with all their strength.  the bamboo is starting
	to bend.

				carter (cont'd)
		all i wanted was a little mu-shu.

				lee
		try to land on your feet.

	carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them.

				carter
		i can't believe i flew ten-thousand
		miles for this shit.

	the pole breaks
