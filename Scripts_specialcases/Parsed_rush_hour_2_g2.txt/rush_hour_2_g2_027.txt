	ext. street - day

	carter starts walking down the street, making his way past an
	outdoor butcher market, getting strange looks from locals and
	tourists alike.  he motions to an old woman who is selling
	live ducks, pigeons and chickens

				carter
		how you doing?  can you direct me to the
		heaven on earth massage parlor?  

	the old woman stares at carter, starts motioning to her cages
	filled with birds.

				carter (cont'd)
		no, i don't eat live birds.  i like my
		birds dead and deep fried.  you ever
		been to popeyes?

	the woman takes out a bird, holds up a hatchet.

				carter (cont'd)
		no, don't do that, i had a big lunch. 
		i'm warning you, i'm a police officer --
		just put the blade down and let the bird
		go.
