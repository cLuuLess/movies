	ext. yacht - continuous

	as carter walks through the ship, he grabs a handful of food
	from a waiter, his eyes searching the crowd, rounds a corner 
	- almost stepping right into hu li, who's approaching steven
	reign.  steven reign is in his 50's -- perfectly groomed,
	impeccably dressed - his looks and bearing say one thing --
	money. 
	he's got the big party smile on, but as hu li arrives,
	reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire
	as sociopath.

	carter steps back, but sees reign whisper to hu li.  carter
	hides and turns away as hu li instinctively scans the room
	for signs of trouble.  he heads into the main party.

	carter stops walking when he comes upon isabella molina, a
	stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of
	champagne.  carter lights her cigarette for her.

				carter
		how you doing, baby?  my name is prince
		mubutu from nigeria.

				isabella
		isabella molina, from san juan.  that
		seat is taken.

				carter
			(in mangled spanish)
		san juan!  you must know my good friend
		pedro martinez hernandez hector
		elizondo.

				isabella
			(in english)
		i don't think so.

				carter
		i'm sorry, you looked like you traveled
		in the best circles.  but hey, i
		understand.  make yourself at home,
		isabella.  champagne, caviar, whatever
		you want.  my ship is your ship.

				isabella
		this is your ship?

				carter
		that's right.  i'm the owner, the
		captain -- you can call me el capitan.

				isabella
		el capitan?

				carter
		i don't want to play games with you,
		isabella.  i like you.  i can see myself
		with you -- in one of those bathrooms
		over there in about five minutes.

				isabella
		well, i'm very tempted.  it's such a
		beautiful yacht.  what's it called?

				carter
		called?  what's my ship called?
			(he has no idea)
		well...it's called the s.s. minnow
		johnson.

				isabella
		the s.s. minow johnson.  funny, the name
		on the back was "red dragon."

				carter
		red dragon?  you sure about that?

				isabella
		i'm sure, because this is my friend's
		yacht.  and it's his party.

				carter
		your friend's ship?
			(looking around)
		oh, man.  i must've walked onto the
		wrong yacht.  i knew there was a reason
		my keys didn't work.

				steven reign
			(taking seat next to isabella)
		who's your friend?

				isabella
		somebody who got on the wrong yacht.

				carter
		wait a second.  you're steven reign? 
		you're big time.  you own all them big
		hotels.  what are you doing in hong
		kong?

				steven reign
			(ushering away isabella)
		i'm just in town for the weekend, taking
		in the sights.

				isabella
		enjoy the party, mr. carter.

	carter nods, waves.  steven reign and isabella walk away. 
	carter's watching.
