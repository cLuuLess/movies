			int. ricky tan's yacht - main cabin - night

	it looks like hugh hefner's bedroom complete with round bed
	and sunken bar.  ricky tan sits in front of a big screen
	satellite tv screaming at the lakers.  hu li opens the door
	and the bodyguards lead lee into the bedroom.

				ricky tan
		come on, shaq, hit a damn free-throw! 
		you can do it, big guy.

	on tv

	we see shaq miss his free throw.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
		shit!  he still doesn't follow through. 
		i just lost five grand.

	tan turns off the tv, turns to lee.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
		why don't we go on the deck, get some
		air...and some privacy.
			(to hu li)
		leave us alone.

	hu li hesitates, upset at being dismissed.

				ricky tan (cont'd)
			(to lee)
		could you have your partner wait for us
		outside?

				carter
		i ain't his partner, i'm a tourist.  i
		got proof.  see, i got a mini-bar key.

				lee
			(to carter)
		i'll meet you on the main deck in ten
		minutes.

	carter pulls lee aside.

				carter
		what, leave you alone so he can cap you?

				lee
		i'm okay, you go.

				carter
		why the hell should you believe him?  he
		had us beat up.  naked.  that's nasty
		shit.

				lee
		remember i told you my father was a
		policeman?
			(beat)
		ricky tan was his partner for ten years.

				carter
			(pause)
		what the hell is going on here?

	no answer.  carter holds lee's glance for a beat, then turns
	and walks the other way.
