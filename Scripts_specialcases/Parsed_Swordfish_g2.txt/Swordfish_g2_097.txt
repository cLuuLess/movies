       a snazzy, sweat-suited kaplan walks out to his shiny new
       silver porsche, racquet ball racquet flipping in hand.
       he's so downright happy in his confidence that he is on
       the fast track to political valhalla, due to his handling
       of this gabriel shear debacle, he is whistling.

       he clicks the porsche key, unlocking the driver's door,
       tosses in his racquet and climbs in.

       he shuts the door and slides the key into the ignition.
       before he cranks it, he catches himself in the rearview
       and winks at himself.

       smiling, he turns the key.

       boom.

       the claymore mine hidden under his seat rips the car
       apart, shrapnel tearing upward through his body and out
       the roof.

                                                                75.

       the thousand pieces of shrapnel divet the concrete ceiling
       and then bounce across the parking garage floor.
