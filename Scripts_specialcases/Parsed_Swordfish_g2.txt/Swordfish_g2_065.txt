     they sit in the clk, parked down the street from holly's
     house.

                             stanley
               you believe in me, right?

                             holly
               of course, but --

                             stanley
               i've found a way to get you back,
               sweetheart. it's my one shot and
               i'm taking it. just give me a
               couple of days.

                             holly
                      (crying)
               i don't want anything else to
               happen to you, dad.

                             stanley
               holly, everything's going to be
               okay. you just have to trust me.

                             holly
                      (crying)
               i love you, daddy.

     holly quickly kisses him, jumps out and runs, crying,
     from the car at full speed, with the giraffe.

     stanley, tears rolling down his face, slaps the steering
     wheel, trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so
     badly.

     suddenly, the passenger door opens and a man in a dark
     blue suit and fed-issued shades gets in.

                             stanley
               who the fuck are you?

                             dark suit #1
                      (flipping out
                       his badge)
               friend of a friend. let's take a
               ride.

     he motions toward a black taurus, now parked across the
     street. in the back, he sees a face he recognizes.

                                                   (continued)

                                                              49.

                                stanley
                  shit...

     the man kinda smiles at stan.

                                dark suit #1
                         (being a dick)
                  gotta suck to be you.

                                stanley
                  yep.

     stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge
     of his nose and jumps out of the car.
