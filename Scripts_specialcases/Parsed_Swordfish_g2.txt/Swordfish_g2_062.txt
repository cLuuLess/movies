61   ext. newton montessori school - day                            61

     a school bell rings and three hundred screaming kids of
     all ages come running from the doors.


     angle on holly

     not your average ten-year-old. even decked out in bell-
     bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she
     carries herself that is older; wiser; sadder.

     she walks into a closeup and scans the driveway.
     reflected in her tiny, round lavender shades we see the
     circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and
     parental types in their m-series mercedes and their lexus
     suvs. she sighs. we crane up, panning left.

     holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the
     mayhem. she looks up and down the street then slowly
     drops her backpack and sits down on the curb. she pulls
     a well-worn copy of william gibson's neuromancer from her
     backpack, and turns up the raging electronica from her
     walkman.

                                                     dissolve to:

                                                           46.

62   same scene - later                                          62

     now there is much less pandemonium. no more buses. we
     crane down to a medium of holly still in the exact same
     spot. holly sighs, pulls back her headphones and grabs
     her startac from her backpack. she opens the phone and
     dials.
