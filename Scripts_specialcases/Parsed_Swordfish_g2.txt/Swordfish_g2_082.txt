80   int. trailer - day                                               80

     a small trailer across the canyon from gabriel's house.

                                roberts
                  who is he?

                  we don't know that yet, sir.

                                                                61.

80    continued:                                                      80

                   there's definitely something going
                   on. there are two t-5 trunks
                   going into the house. that's
                   serious bandwidth. thermal scopes
                   indicate a huge heat-load in the
                   main living area. could be from
                   mainframes, although they must
                   have a genny 'cause power
                   consumption is right on par.

                                 fbi agent #1
                   some of these fellows might be
                   dressed in armani, but they
                   definitely have the swagger of ex-
                   military. maybe bodyguards but
                   they seem more like mercs to me.

                   from here we're having trouble
                   pinning any of them down. sure
                   would be nice to task a satellite,
                   sir.

                                 roberts
                   i'm working on it. send what you
                   have up-lines, maybe we'll have
                   one by the end of the week.

      roberts walks out of the trailer.

80b   int. trailer - day                                              80b

      roberts looks out the window through a camera with a huge
      lens.


80c   long lens pov                                                   80c

      gabriel stands by the pool, his back toward us. slowly,
      gabriel turns around. he is staring directly at us.


80d   int. trailer - day                                              80d

      roberts instinctively jerks his head up.    slowly he looks
      back into the eyepiece.

                                                        (continued)

80d   continued:                                                     80d

                                 roberts
                   who the hell is that?

      he presses the switch and the camera's shutter whirls.
