26   ext. middle of nowhere - day                                    26

     we are indeed in the middle of nowhere, no nothing as far
     as you can see. we continue to crane up, a $140,000
     ferrari modena flies down the road in a cloud of
     suspended gravel toward stanley's dilapidated, piece-o'-
     crap trailer.
