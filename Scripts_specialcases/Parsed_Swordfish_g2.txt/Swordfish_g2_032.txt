     on phone. he stands in front of his now closed fridge.
     it is covered with pictures of his daughter, holly.

                                stanley
                  i want to talk with holly.

     intercut between the two.

     melissa's accent continues to travel eastward from
     midwest flat to full tilt long island.

                                  melissa
                  it's...
                         (looks at her watch)
                  it's twelve-thirty, stanley.
                  she's in school. you know it's
                  illegal for you to talk to her.

                                stanley
                  don't do this, mel. it's not good
                  for holly --

                                melissa
                  how the hell would you know what
                  is or isn't good for my daughter?
                  you've spent the last two years in
                  prison.

                                  stanley

                                melissa
                  stop calling me that, stanley.

                                stanley
                  i just want to see my baby.

                                melissa
                  well, she doesn't want to see you,
                  stanley, and i swear to fucking
                  god, if you contact her, i'll have
                  larry's attorney throw you into a
                  hole so deep and dark it'll make
                  leavenworth seem like two weeks in
                  vegas; during which i'll
                  personally pay two ball-busting
                  skin-heads to --

                                stanley
                  wow, mel, you can take the girl
                  out of the trailer park, but you
                  can't take the trailer park out of
                  the girl.

     she regains control.       her voice is accentless once again.

                                melissa
                         (exhaling)
                  i will not let myself be
                  manipulated by you, stanley.
                  larry's her father now.

                                stanley
                  larry's the porn king --

                                melissa
                  larry's a film financier, a good
                  husband, and an astute
                  businessman. what films he's
                  involved in are a function of
                  profitability and none of your
                  business.

     she is now downright icy.

                                melissa
                  get help, stanley, get into a
                  program, get a therapist, get a
                  dog, but whatever you do, stay
                  away from my child.

                                  stanley
                  your child?    she's our child.

                                melissa
                  she will never be your child.
                  you'll never have the kind of
                  money to match larry's lawyers in
                  court. forget holly.

     click.

     the phone goes dead.

     stanley freaks, beats the receiver against the fridge,
     again, and again. then, he calmly hangs up the phone.
