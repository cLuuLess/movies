     stanley runs around the corner.

     gabriel is standing in the doorway, directly in front of
     stanley. stan damn near falls down.

                               gabriel
               stan?

     stan can't say a word.

                                                                66.

                                gabriel
                  what's wrong, stanley, you look
                  like you've seen a ghost?

     gabriel looks in and sees the empty wine bottle at the
     computer station.

                                gabriel
                  c'mon, stanley. let's talk.

                                   stanley
                            (uneasy)
                  okay...

                                   gabriel
                  let's go.

                                stanley
                  why can't we talk here?

                                gabriel
                  'cause i don't want to talk to you
                  in the house, stanley.

     gabriel walks out.       stanley slowly follows.

                                   gabriel
                  let's go.

     stan slowly follows.
