     torvalds talks to his attorney in finnish. apparently
     his attorney is trying to convince him of something.
     torvalds, unfazed, walks over to the one-way mirror.

     pull back from torvalds to reveal bad agent #2 calmly
     screwing a silencer on to his .45. torvalds leans closer
     to the glass.

     bad agent #2 sticks the silenced barrel of the gun up
     against the glass -- right between the eyes of torvalds.
     bad agent #2 moves the barrel up and down between
     torvalds face and neck.
