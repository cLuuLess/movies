33   ext. stanley's trailer - day                                   33

     stanley walks down the steps of his trailer. ginger sits
     on the hood of her car in all her estrogenic glory,
     smoking and petting stan's dog.

                                stanley
                  what are you doing here?

     stanley's dog leans against her, happy.

                                  stanley
                           (to dog, like
                            "traitor")
                  judas.

                                ginger
                  hello, stanley.

     she smiles at him. he smiles back, about ready to stick
     her in the trunk of her car.

                                stanley
                  look, i'm beginning to lose my
                  sense of humor about --

                                ginger
                  let's cut through the bullshit,
                  stan. if you ever want to have a
                  chance in hell of getting your
                  daughter back you'll shut up and
                  listen. unless of course you want
                  to stay here in your pathetic,
                  loser life while she learns what
                  it's like to be a fluffer in one
                  of her new daddy's videos.

                                 stanley
                  do me the courtesy of not
                  confusing your own childhood with
                  my daughter's.

                                ginger
                  look at your situation, stanley.
                  for twenty months you've been in
                  court six times, each time your
                  custody case has been thrown out.
                  your situation doesn't look good,
                  sweetheart.

     she blows smoke at him, thinking, then whips out her
     trump card.

                                ginger
                  how much would it cost to retain
                  the best family lawyer in the
                  country and regain custody of your
                  daughter?

                                stanley
                  all the way through the jury
                  trial?

                                 ginger
                  yeah.

                                 stanley
                  a lot.

     she pulls out a large manila envelope. opens it and
     dumps the rubber-banded stacks of hundreds onto the
     ground.

                                ginger
                  this should get you started.

     stanley just stares at the money.     he looks up at ginger.

                                ginger
                  whattaya have to lose? just meet
                  him. one time. that's it. you
                  don't like the setup, walk away.

                                 stanley
                  that's it?

                                 ginger
                  that's it.   and you keep the
                  money.

     she smokes, letting it all sink in. she puts out her
     cigarette. they just stare at each other. she smiles.

                                                       fade to black.
