     stan walks back in, looking for semi-clean clothes.

                                stanley
                  you're wasting your time. i even
                  touch a computer, i go straight to
                  leavenworth, do not pass go, do
                  not collect 200 dollars. whatever
                  i was...

     stanley, pulling on his pants, lets the sentence hang,
     unfinished.

     he's putting on his shoes. she squats down in front of
     him, resting her hand on his leg.

                                ginger
                  stanley, think about it, they
                  still teach your techniques at
                  m.i.t.

     she smiles up at him, then takes a long drink of her
     beer. stan stares at her a moment, then...

                                                       (continued)

                                ginger
                  i'm not here to suck your dick,
                  stanley, you can sit around doing
                  the martyr thing as long as you
                  like. he'll pay you just to meet
                  you.

                                stanley
                         (smiles)
                  i gotta go to work.

                                ginger
                  oh that's right, and fine work it
                  is, too.
                         (beat)
                  stanley...
                         (beat)
                  have you spoken to holly lately?

     she just dropped a 20 megaton thermonuclear warhead into
     stanley's universe.
