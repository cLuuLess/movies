      now it is 9:35.

                                  stanley
                   almost done.

      suddenly the lights flicker, stan's screen blanks out
      momentarily, then blazes back to life, his code
      scrambled. stan instinctively jerks his hands away from
      the keyboard.

                                stanley
                   whoa! what the hell just
                   happened?

      gabriel looks at the lights as they flicker back on, the
      huge portable generator springing to life.

                                 gabriel
                   they just cut the power. forget
                   it. how long to transfer the
                   money?

                                 stanley
                   couple of minutes. which
                   accounts?

                                 gabriel
                   national bank of zurich. spread
                   it evenly over these accounts. it
                   won't be there that long.

                                      stanley
                            (dryly)
                   great.

                                 gabriel
                   good job, stanley, i got someone
                   who wants to see you.

      they bring holly out.

                                      stanley
                   holly!

      stanley grabs her and pulls her close to him.

                                      stanley
                   are you okay?

      holly nods yes. stanley and holly are escorted toward
      the door. gabriel stands in front, holding his fn-fal.
      he is speaking in french to several of the mercs.

                                      gabriel
                   hold up.

      stanley stops. gabriel walks down the steps and unhooks
      holly's collar. stan is about to freak.

                                 gabriel
                          (to stanley)
                   told you i was a man of my word,
                   stanley.

      he walks back. marco unlocks the door. stanley and
      holly look at each other. holly starts to cry.

                                   stanley
                   it's okay.    i love you, baby.

      marco stares at stanley as they walk out.

                                      marco
                   see ya around.

                                      stanley
                   i doubt it.

      he starts to walk out...

                                 cypher merc #3
                   sir, the money just disappeared.

                                      gabriel
                   what?

                                                      (continued)

                                                               91.

                                 cypher merc #3
                   the money, it's gone.

      gabriel turns around to look at stanley.    we zoom into a
      closeup. he's pissed.

                                 gabriel
                   what do you mean, gone?


      wider

      we see stanley. he looks like he just got caught with
      his hand in the cookie jar.

                                  stanley
                   shit!   run, holly!

                                  gabriel
                   get her!

      marco pulls his assault rifle but stanley waylays him.
      they both hit the ground.
