56   ext. prague valet - night                                              56

     next to the valet stand, gabriel leans over the hood of
     an evil-looking, bright-yellow lamborghini diablo
     roadster, a gameboy chirping in his hands.

     stanley walks into the frame.          without missing a beat,
     gabriel looks up --

                                 gabriel
                  big stan.   i was afraid we lost
                  you.

     gabriel stands up and walks toward stan.

                                stanley
                  tell me what the deal is.

                                gabriel
                  let's go up to the house. i'm
                  having a little get-together. i'll
                  explain it to you there.

     gabriel smiles.
