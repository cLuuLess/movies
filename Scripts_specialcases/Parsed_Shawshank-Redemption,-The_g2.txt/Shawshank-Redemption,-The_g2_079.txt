103	int -- prison library/andy's office -- day (1954) 103

	floyd rushes in with andy and red at his heels. they find 
	jigger and snooze trying to calm brooks, who has heywood in a 
	chokehold and a knife to his throat. heywood is terrified. 

				jigger 
		c'mon, brooksie, why don't you just 
		calm the fuck down, okay? 

				brooks 
		goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons 
		of whores! 

	he kicks a table over. tax files explode through the air. 

				red 
		what the hell's going on? 

				snooze 
		you tell me, man. one second he was 
		fine, then out came the knife. i 
		better get the guards. 

				red 
		no. we'll handle this. ain't that 
		right, brooks? just settle down and 
		we'll talk about it, okay? 

				brooks 
		nothing left to talk about! it's all 
		talked out! nothing left now but to 
		cut his fuckin' throat! 

				red 
		why? what's heywood done to you? 

				brooks 
		that's what they want! it's the 
		price i gotta pay! 

	andy steps forward, rivets brooks with a gaze. softly: 

				andy 
		brooks, you're not going to hurt 
		heywood, we all know that. even 
		heywood knows it, right heywood? 

				heywood 
			(nods, terrified) 
		sure. i know that. sure. 

				andy 
		why? ask anyone, they'll tell you. 
		brooks hatlen is a reasonable man. 

				red 
			(cuing nods all around) 
		yeah, that's right. that's what 
		everybody says. 

				andy 
		you're not fooling anybody, so just 
		put the damn knife down and stop 
		scaring the shit out of people. 

				brooks 
		but it's the only way they'll let 
		me stay. 

	brooks bursts into tears. the storm is over. heywood staggers
	free, gasping for air. andy takes the knife, passes it to red.
	brooks dissolves into andy's arms with great heaving sobs.

				andy 
		take it easy. you'll be all right. 

				heywood 
		him? what about me? crazy old 
		fool! goddamn near slit my throat! 

				red 
		you've had worse from shaving. 
		what'd you do to set him off? 

				heywood 
		nothin'! just came in to say 
		fare-thee-well. 
			(off their looks) 
		ain't you heard? his parole came 
		through! 

	red and andy exchange a surprised look. andy wants to 
	understand. red just motions to let it be for now. he puts his
	arm around brooks, who sobs inconsolably. softly: 

				red 

	ain't that bad, old hoss. won't be 
	long till you're squiring pretty 
	young girls on your arm and telling 
	'em lies.
