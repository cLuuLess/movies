				tommy 
		'bout four years ago, i was in 
		thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. 
		stole a car. dumbfuck thing to do. 
			(beat) 
		few months left to go, i get a new 
		cellmate in. elmo blatch. big 
		twitchy fucker. crazy eyes. kind of 
		roomie you pray you don't get, know 
		what i'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed 
		burglary. said he done hundreds of 
		jobs. hard to believe, high-strung 
		as he was. cut a loud fart, he'd go 
		three feet in the air. talked all 
		the time, too, that's the other 
		thing. never shut up. places he'd 
		been, jobs he pulled, women he 
		fucked. even people he killed. 
		people that gave him shit, that's 
		how he put it. one night, like a 
		joke, i say: "yeah? who'd you 
		kill?" so he says... 

				blatch 
		...i got me this job one time 
		bussin' tables at a country club. 
		so i could case all the big rich 
		pricks that come in. i pick out 
		this guy, go in one night and do 
		his place. he wakes up and gives 
		me shit. so i killed him. him and 
		the tasty bitch he was with. 
			(starts laughing) 
		that's the best part! she's fuckin' 
		this prick, see, this golf pro, but 
		she's married to some other guy! 
		some hotshot banker. he's the one 
		they pinned it on! they got him 
		down-maine somewhere doin' time for 
		the crime! ain't that choice? 

	he throws his head back and roars with laughter.
