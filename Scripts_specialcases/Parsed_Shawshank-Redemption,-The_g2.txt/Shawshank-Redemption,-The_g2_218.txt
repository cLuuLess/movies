269	ext -- fields -- late day (1966) 269

	convicts hoe the fields. guards patrol on horseback. 

				red (v.o.) 
		...and when they fly away, the part 
		of you that knows it was a sin to 
		lock them up does rejoice...but still, 
		the place you live is that much more 
		drab and empty that they're gone. 

	a distant rumble of thunder. red pauses, gazes off. storm 
	clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. a light drizzle begins. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i guess i just miss my friend.
