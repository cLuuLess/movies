27	int -- fat-ass' cell -- night (1947) 27

	fat-ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. 

				heywood (o.s.) 
		this ain't such a bad place. i'll 
		introduce you around, make you feel 
		right at home. i know some big ol' 
		bull queers who'd love to make your 
		acquaintance...especially that big 
		white mushy butt of yours... 

	and that's it. fat-ass lets out a loud wail of despair: 

				fat-ass 
		oh god! i don't belong here! i 
		wanna go home!
