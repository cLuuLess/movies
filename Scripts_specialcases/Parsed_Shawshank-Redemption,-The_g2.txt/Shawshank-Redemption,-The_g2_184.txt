229	ext -- field -- day (1966) 229

	shawshank is half a mile distant. we track along a muddy creel
	as state troopers and prison guards scour the brush. a troopee
	fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. 

				red (v.o.) 
		all they found of him was a muddy 
		set of prison clothes, a bar of 
		soap, and an old rock-hammer damn 
		near worn down to the nub. 

	trooper g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. swish pan 
	to a police photographer. his flashbulb glare produces: 

230 	a black and white still photo 230

	of the hapless cops posing with andy's reeking uniform and the
	worn rock-hammer. push in on the hammer. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i remember thinking it would take a 
		man six hundred years to tunnel 
		through the wall with it. andy did 
		it in less than twenty.
