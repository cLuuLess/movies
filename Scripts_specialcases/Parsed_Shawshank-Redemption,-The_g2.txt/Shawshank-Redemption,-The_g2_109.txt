145	ext -- exercise yard -- day (1955) 145

	camera tracks along groups of men, all riveted. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i have no idea to this day what 
		them two italian ladies were 
		singin' about. truth is, i don't 
		want to know. some things are best 
		left unsaid. i like to think they 
		were singin' about something so 
		beautiful it can't be expressed in 
		words, and makes your heart ache 
		because of it. 

	camera brings us to red. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i tell you, those voices soared. 
		higher and farther than anybody in 
		a gray place dares to dream. it was 
		like some beautiful bird flapped 
		into our drab little cage and made 
		these walls dissolve away...and for 
		the briefest of moments -- every 
		last man at shawshank felt free.
