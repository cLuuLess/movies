	red emerges into fading daylight. andy's waiting for him.

				red 
		same old, same old. thirty years. 
		jesus. when you say it like that... 

				andy 
		you wonder where it went. i wonder 
		where ten years went. 

	red nods, solemn. they settle in on the bleachers. andy pulls 
	a small box from his sweater, hands it to red. 

				andy 
		anniversary gift. open it. 

	red does. inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a 
	shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red. 

				andy 
		had to go through one of your 
		competitors. hope you don't mind. 
		wanted it to be a surprise. 

				red 
		it's very pretty, andy. thank you. 

				andy 
		you gonna play something?

	red considers it, shakes his head. softly: 

				red 
		not today.
