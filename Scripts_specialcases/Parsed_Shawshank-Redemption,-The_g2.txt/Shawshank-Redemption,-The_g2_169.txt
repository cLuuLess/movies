212	int -- red's cell -- night (1966) 212

	red hears andy coming, moves to the bars. he watches andy come 
	up to the second tier and pause before his cell. 

				guard (o.s.) 
		open number twelve! 

	andy gazes directly at red. a beat of eye contact. red shakes 
	his head. don't do it. andy smiles, eerily calm...and enters 
	his cell. the door closes. ka-thump! we hold on red's face.
