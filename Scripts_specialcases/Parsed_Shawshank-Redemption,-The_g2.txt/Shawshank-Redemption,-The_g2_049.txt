	the cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. 

				red (v.o.) 
		...wound up sitting in a row at ten 
		o'clock in the morning, drinking icy 
		cold black label beer courtesy of 
		the hardest screw that ever walked 
		a turn at shawshank state prison. 

				hadley 
		drink up, boys. while it's cold. 

				red (v.o.) 
		the colossal prick even managed to 
		sound magnanimous. 

	red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his
	tongue and the warm sun on face. 

				red (v.o.) 
		we sat and drank with the sun on 
		our shoulders, and felt like free 
		men. we could'a been tarring the 




	roof of one of our own houses. we 
	were the lords of all creation. 

	he glances over to andy squatting apart from the others.

				red (v.o.) 
		as for andy, he spent that break 
		hunkered in the shade, a strange 
		little smile on his face, watching 
		us drink his beer. 

				heywood 
			(approaches with a beer) 
		here's a cold one, andy. 

				andy 
		no thanks. i gave up drinking. 

	heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. 

				red (v.o.) 
		you could argue he'd done it to 
		curry favor with the guards. or 
		maybe make a few friends among us 
		cons. me, i think he did it just to 
		feel normal again...if only for a 
		short while.
