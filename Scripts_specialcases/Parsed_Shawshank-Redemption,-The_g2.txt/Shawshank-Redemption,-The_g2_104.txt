131	int -- guard station/outer office -- day (1955) 131

	andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, 
	sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. he plugs the 
	machine in. a red light warms up. the platter starts spinning. 

	he slides the mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the 
	platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. the 
	needle hisses in the groove...and the music begins, lilting 
	and gorgeous. andy sinks into wiley's chair, overcome by its 
	beauty. it is "deutino: che soave zeffiretto," a duet sung by 

	susanna and the contessa.
