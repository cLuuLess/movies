101	int -- andy's cell -- night (1953) 101

	dark. andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of 
	quartz. it's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of 
	a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. 

	he puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 
	four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. 
	he turns to rita. moonlight casts bars across her face.
