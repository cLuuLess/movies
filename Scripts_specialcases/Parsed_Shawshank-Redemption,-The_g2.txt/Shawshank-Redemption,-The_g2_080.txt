		heywood, enough. ain't nothing 
		wrong with brooksie. he's just 
		institutionalized, that's all. 

				heywood

				red 
		man's been here fifty years. this 
		place is all he knows. in here, 
		he's an important man, an educated 
		man. a librarian. out there, he's 
		nothing but a used-up old con with 
		arthritis in both hands. couldn't 
		even get a library card if he 
		applied. you see what i'm saying? 

				floyd 
		red, i do believe you're talking 
		out of your ass. 

				red 
		believe what you want. these walls 
		are funny. first you hate 'em, then 
		you get used to 'em. after long 
		enough, you get so you depend on 
		'em. that's "institutionalized." 

				jigger 
		shit. i could never get that way. 

				ernie 
			(softly) 
		say that when you been inside as 
		long as brooks has. 

				red

		for life, and that's just what they 
		take. part that counts, anyway.
