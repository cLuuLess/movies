36	ext -- exercise yard -- day (1947) 36

	exercise period. red plays catch with heywood and jigger, 
	lazily tossing a baseball around. red notices andy off to the
	side. nods hello. andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 
	heywood and jigger pause, watching. 

				andy 
			(offers his hand) 
		hello. i'm andy dufresne. 

	red glances at the hand, ignores it. the game continues.

				red 
		the wife-killin' banker. 

				andy 
		how do you know that? 

				red 
		i keep my ear to the ground. why'd 
		you do it? 

				andy 
		i didn't, since you ask. 

				red 
		hell, you'll fit right in, then. 
			(off andy's look) 
		everyone's innocent in here, don't 
		you know that? heywood! what are 
		you in for, boy? 

				heywood 
		didn't do it! lawyer fucked me! 

	red gives andy a look. see? 

				andy 
		what else have you heard? 

				red 
		people say you're a cold fish. they 
		say you think your shit smells 
		sweeter than ordinary. that true? 


				andy 
		what do you think? 

				red 
		ain't made up my mind yet. 

	heywood nudges jigger. watch this. he winds up and throws the
	ball hard -- right at andy's head. andy sees it coming out of
	the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. beat. he sends
	the ball right back, zinging it into heywood's hands. heywood
	drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 

				andy 
		i understand you're a man who knows 
		how to get things. 

				red 
		i'm known to locate certain things 
		from time to time. they seem to 
		fall into my hands. maybe it's 
		'cause i'm irish. 

				andy 
		i wonder if you could get me a 
		rock-hammer? 

				red 
		what is it and why? 

				andy 
		you make your customers' motives a 
		part of your business? 


				red 
		if you wanted a toothbrush, i 
		wouldn't ask questions. i'd just 
		quote a price. a toothbrush, see, 
		is a non-lethal sort of object. 

				andy 
		fair enough. a rock-hammer is about 
		eight or nine inches long. looks 
		like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
		small sharp pick on one end, and a 
		blunt hammerhead on the other. it's 
		for rocks. 

				red 
		rocks. 

	andy squats, motions red to join him. andy grabs a handful of
	dirt and sifts it through his hands. he finds a pebble and
	rubs it clean. it has a nice milky glow. he tosses it to red.

				red 
		quartz? 

				andy 
		quartz, sure. and look. mica. shale. 
		silted granite. there's some graded 
		limestone, from when they cut this 
		place out of the hill. 

				red 
		so? 

				andy 
		i'm a rockhound. at least i was, in 
		my old life. i'd like to be again, 
		on a limited scale. 

				red 
		yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 
		in somebody's skull? 

				andy 
		i have no enemies here. 

				red 
		no? just wait. 

	red flicks his gaze past andy. bogs is watching them. 

				red 
		word gets around. the sisters have 
		taken a real shine to you, yes they 
		have. especially bogs. 

				andy 
		tell me something. would it help if 
		i explained to them i'm not 
		homosexual? 

				red 
		neither are they. you have to be 
		human first. they don't qualify. 
			(off andy's look) 
		bull queers take by force, that's 
		all they want or understand. i'd 
		grow eyes in the back of my head if 
		i were you. 

				andy 
		thanks for the advice. 

				red 
		that comes free. but you understand 
		my concern. 

				andy 
		if there's trouble, i doubt a rock- 
		hammer will do me any good. 

				red 
		then i guess you wanna escape. 
		tunnel under the wall maybe? 
			(andy laughs politely) 
		i miss the joke. what's so funny? 

				andy 

	you'll know when you see the rock- 
	hammer. 

				red 
		what's this item usually go for? 

				andy 
		seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

				red 
		my standard mark-up's twenty 
		percent, but we're talkin' about a 
		special object. risk goes up, price 
		goes up. call it ten bucks even. 

				andy 
		ten it is. 

				red 
		i'll see what i can do. 
			(rises, slapping dust) 
		but it's a waste of money. 

				andy 
		oh? 

				red 
		folks who run this place love 
		surprise inspections. they turn a 
		blind eye to some things, but not 
		a gadget like that. they'll find 
		it, and you'll lose it. mention my 
		name, we'll never do business 
		again. not for a pair of shoelaces 
		or a stick of gum. 

				andy 
		i understand. thank you, mr...? 

				red 
		red. the name's red. 

				andy 
		red. i'm andy. pleasure doing 
		business with you. 

	they shake. andy strolls off. red watches him go. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i could see why some of the boys 
		took him for snobby. he had a quiet 
		way about him, a walk and a talk 
		that just wasn't normal around 
		here. he strolled. like a man in a 
		park without a care or worry. like 
		he had on an invisible coat that 
		would shield him from this place. 
			(resumes playing catch) 
		yes, i think it would be fair to 
		say i liked andy from the start.
