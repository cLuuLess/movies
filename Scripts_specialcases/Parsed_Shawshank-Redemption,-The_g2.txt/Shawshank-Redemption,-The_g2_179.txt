224	int -- vertical shaft -- day (1966) 224

	dark as midnight. concrete walls rise on both sides. if you 
	imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this 
	particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark
	tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. rory's appears, shining
	his flashlight down the shaft. somewhere, a rat squeaks. 

				red (v.o.) 
		it was his third day on the job. 

				rory 
		warden? there's a space here 
		between the walls 'bout three feet 
		across! smells pretty damn bad! 

				norton (o.s.) 
		i don't care what it smells like! 

				hadley (o.s.) 
		go on, boy! we got a hold of you! 

	looking none too happy about it, rory squeezes from the tunnel 
	and dangles into the shaft. he gets lowered, shining his 
	light, smothered by darkness. not having a good time. 

				rory 
		hoo-whee! smell's gettin' worse! 

				norton (o.s.) 
		never mind, i said! just keep going! 

				rory 
		smells pretty damn bad, warden! in 
		fact, it smells just like shit. 

	his feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the 
	ground. it's not. in fact, it's just what it smells like. he 
	sinks in past his ankles. he slips and sits heavily in it. 

				rory 
		oh god, that's what it is, it's 
		shit. oh my god it's shit. pull me 
		out 'fore i blow my groceries, oh 
		shit it's shit, oh my gawwwwwwd!
