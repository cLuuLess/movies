264	int -- norton's office -- day (1966) 264

	...so do the bullets. norton is riveted to the door. for every
	key, he loads another bullet. methodical and grim. he gets the
	final bullet in just as the right key slams home. the door 
	bursts open. men muscle in. somebody shouts. troopers dive in
	all directions as norton raises the gun -- 

	-- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall
	goes red. his swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to
	a final stop. troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i like to think the last thing that 
		went through his head...other than 
		that bullet...was to wonder how the 
		hell andy dufresne ever got the 
		best of him. 

	push slowly to the wall to reveal mrs. norton's framed sampler
	trickling blood and brains...and we get our final bible lesson
	for today: "his judgment cometh and that right soon."
