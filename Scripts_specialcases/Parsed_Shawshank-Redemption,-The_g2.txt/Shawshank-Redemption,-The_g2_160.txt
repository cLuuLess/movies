198	ext -- prison -- night (1966) 198

	a steel door rattles open. mert leads tommy outside to a gate, 
	unlocks it. tommy looks around. 

				tommy 
		out here? 

				mert 
		that's what the man said. 

	mert swings the gate open, sends tommy through, turns and 
	heads back inside. tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock
	access for the shops and mills. some vehicles parked. the 
	place is deserted. he stops, sensing a presence. 

				tommy 
		warden? 

	norton steps into the light. 

				norton 
		tommy, we've got a situation here. 
		i think you can appreciate that. 

				tommy 
		yes sir, i sure can. 

				norton 
		i tell you, son, this really came 
		along and knocked my wind out. it's 
		got me up nights, that's the truth. 

	norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers tommy a smoke. tommy
	takes one. norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter.

				norton 
		the right decision. sometimes it's 
		hard to figure out what that is. 
		you understand? 
			(tommy nods) 
		think hard, tommy. if i'm gonna 
		move on this, there can't be the 
		least little shred of doubt. i have 
		to know if you what you told 
		dufresne was the truth. 

				tommy 
		yes sir. absolutely. 

				norton 
		would you be willing to swear before 
		a judge and jury...having placed 
		your hand on the good book and taken 
		an oath before almighty god himself? 

				tommy 
		just gimme that chance. 

				norton 
		that's what i thought. 

	norton drops his cigarette. crushes it out with the toe of his 
	shoe. glances up toward the plate shop roof as -- 

199 	high angle from plate shop roof (sniper pov) 199

	-- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping tommy's image 
	into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs. 

200 	the sniper 200

	rapid-fires a carbine -- blam!blam!blam!blam! -- his face lit 
	up by the muzzle flashes. captain hadley. 

201 	tommy 201

	gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. he smacks the ground in 
	a twitching, thrashing heap. eyes wide and staring. dead. 
	surprise still stamped on his face. silence now. norton 
	turns, strolls into darkness.
