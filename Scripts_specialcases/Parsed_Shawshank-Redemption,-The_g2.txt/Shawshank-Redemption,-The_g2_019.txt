21	int -- cellblock five -- night (1947) 21

	low angle. a cellblock guard strolls into frame. 

				guard 
		that's lights out! good night, ladies. 

	the lights bump off in sequence. the guard exits, footsteps
	echoing away. darkness now. silence. camera cranes up the 
	tiers toward red's cell. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i remember my first night. seems a 
		long time ago now. 

	red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. listens. 
	waits. from somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.
	voices drift through the cellblock, taunting: 

				various voices (o.s.) 
		fishee fishee fisheeee...you're 
		gonna like it here, new fish. a 
		whooole lot...make you wish your 
		daddies never dicked your 
		mommies...you takin' this down, new 
		fish? gonna be a quiz later. 
			(somebody laughs) 
		sshhh. keep it down. the screws'll 
		hear...fishee fishee fisheeee... 

				red (v.o.) 
		the boys always go fishin' with 
		first-timers...and they don't quit 
		till they reel someone in. 

	the voices keep on, sly and creepy in the dark...
