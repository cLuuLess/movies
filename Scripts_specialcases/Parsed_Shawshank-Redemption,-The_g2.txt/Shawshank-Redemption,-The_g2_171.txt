214	int -- red's cell -- night (1966) 214

	red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold 

	himself still. he feels like he might scream or shake to 
	pieces. the seconds tick by, each an eternity. 

				red (v.o.) 
		i have had some long nights in 
		stir. alone in the dark with 
		nothing but your thoughts, time can 
		draw out like a blade... 

	a flash of lightning outside his window sends harsh barred 
	shadows jittering across the cell. a storm breaking. 

				red (v.o.) 
		that was the longest night of my 
		life...
