204	int -- norton's office -- day (1966) 204

	andy is led in. the door is closed. alone with norton. softly, 

				norton 
		terrible thing. man that young, 
		less than a year to go, trying to 
		escape. broke captain hadley's 
		heart to shoot him, truly it did. 

				andy 
		i'm done. it stops right now. get 
		h&r block to declare your income. 

	norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage. 

				norton 
		nothing stops! nothing! 
			(tight) 
		or you will do the hardest time 
		there is. no more protection from 
		the guards. i'll pull you out of 
		that one-bunk hilton and put you in 
			(more) 

	-
				norton (cont.) 
		with the biggest bull queer i can 
		find. you'll think you got fucked 
		by a train! and the library? gone! 
		sealed off brick by brick! we'll 
		have us a little book-barbecue in 
		the yard! they'll see the flames 
		for miles! we'll dance around it 
		like wild indians! do you understand 
		me? are you catching my drift? 

	slow push in on andy's face. eyes hollow. his beaten 
	expression says it all...
