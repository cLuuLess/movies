5	int -- courtroom -- day (1946) 5

	the jury listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 
	pale-faced and stupefied. 

				d.a. (o.s.) 
		mr. dufresne, describe the 
		confrontation you had with your 
		wife the night she was murdered. 

	andy dufresne 

	is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
	hair meticulously combed. he speaks in soft, measured tones: 

				andy 
		it was very bitter. she said she 
		was glad i knew, that she hated all 
		the sneaking around. she said she 
		wanted a divorce in reno. 

				d.a. 
		what was your response? 

				andy 
		i told her i would not grant one. 

				d.a. 
			(refers to his notes) 
		i'll see you in hell before i see
		you in reno. those were the words 
		you used, mr. dufresne, according 
		to the testimony of your neighbors. 

				andy 
		if they say so. i really don't 
		remember. i was upset.

				d.a. 
		what happened after you and your 
		wife argued? 

				andy 
		she packed a bag and went to stay 
		with mr. quentin. 

				d.a. 
		glenn quentin. the golf pro at the 
		falmouth hills country club. the 
		man you had recently discovered was 
		her lover. 
			(andy nods) 
		did you follow her? 

				andy 
		i went to a few bars first. later, 
		i decided to drive to mr. quentin's 
		home and confront them. they 
		weren't there...so i parked my car 
		in the turnout...and waited. 

				d.a. 
		with what intention? 

				andy 
		i'm not sure. i was confused. drunk. 
		i think mostly i wanted to scare them. 

				d.a. 
		you had a gun with you? 

				andy 
		yes. i did. 

	fade to black: 3rd title up 

				d.a. 
		when they arrived, you went up 
		to the house and murdered them? 

				andy 
		no. i was sobering up. i realized 
		she wasn't worth it. i decided to 
		let her have her quickie divorce. 

				d.a. 
		quickie divorce indeed. a .38 
		caliber divorce, wrapped in a 
		handtowel to muffle the shots, 
		isn't that what you mean? and then 
		you shot her lover! 

				andy 
		i did not. i got back in the car 
		and drove home to sleep it off. 
		along the way, i stopped and threw 
		my gun into the royal river. i feel 
		i've been very clear on this point. 

				d.a. 
		yes, you have. where i get hazy, 
		though, is the part where the 
		cleaning woman shows up the next 
		morning and finds your wife and her 
		lover in bed, riddled with .38 
		caliber bullets. does that strike 
		you as a fantastic coincidence, mr. 
		dufresne, or is it just me? 

				andy 
			(softly) 
		yes. it does. 

				d.a. 
		i'm sorry, mr. dufresne, i don't 
		think the jury heard that. 

				andy 
		yes. it does. 

				d.a. 
		does what? 

				andy 
		strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 

				d.a. 
		on that, sir, we are in accord... 

	fade to black! 4th title up 

				d.a. 
		you claim you threw your gun into 
		the royal river before the murders 
		took place. that's rather convenient. 

				andy 
		it's the truth. 

				d.a. 
		you recall lt. mincher's testimony? 
		he and his men dragged that river 
		for three days and nary a gun was 
		found. so no comparison can be made 
		between your gun and the bullets 
		taken from the bloodstained corpses 
		of the victims. that's also rather 
		convenient, isn't it, mr. dufresne? 

				andy 
			(faint, bitter smile) 
		since i am innocent of this crime, 
		sir, i find it decidedly inconvenient 
		the gun was never found.
