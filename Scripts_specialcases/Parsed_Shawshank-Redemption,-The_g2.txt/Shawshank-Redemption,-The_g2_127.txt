164	ext -- wooded fields -- day (1965) 164

	a road-gang is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud. 

				red (v.o.) 
		'course, norton failed to mention 
		to the press that "bare minimum of 
		expense" is a fairly loose term. 
		there are a hundred different ways 
		to skim off the top. men, 
		materials, you name it. and, oh my 
		lord, how the money rolled in... 

	norton strolls into view with ned grimes at his heels. 

				ned 
		this keeps up, you're gonna put me 
		out of business! with this pool of 
		slave labor you got, you can 
		underbid any contractor in town. 

				norton 
		ned, we're providing a valuable 
		community service. 

				ned 
		that's fine for the papers, but i 
		got a family to feed. the state 
		don't pay my salary. sam, we go 
		back a long way. i need this new 
		highway contract. i don't get it, i 
		go under. that's a fact. 
			(hands him a box) 
		now you just have some'a this fine 
		pie my missus baked specially for 
		you, and you think about that. 

	norton opens the box. alongside the pie is an envelope. he
	runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.

	in the background, a winch cable snaps and whips through the
	air, damn near severing a man's leg. he goes down, screaming
	in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. men rush over
	to help him. norton barely takes notice. 

				norton 
		ned, i wouldn't worry too much over 
		this contract. seems to me i've 
		already got my boys committed 
		elsewhere. you be sure and thank 
		maisie for this fine pie.
