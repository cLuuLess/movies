288	int -- red's room -- night 288

	red lies smoking in bed. unable to sleep. 

				red (v.o.) 
		terrible thing, to live in fear. 
		brooks hatlen knew it. knew it all 
		too well. all i want is to be back 
		where things make sense. where i 
		won't have to be afraid all the time. 

	he glances up at the ceiling beam. "brooks hatlen was here." 

				red (v.o.) 
		only one thing stops me. a promise 
		i made to andy.
