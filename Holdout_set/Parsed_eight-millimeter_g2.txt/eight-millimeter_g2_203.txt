     ext.  hotel room, balcony -- night

     welles sits with his feet up on the balcony rail, looking
     into the parking lot.  amy joins him, sits.

                             amy
                 promise you'll stay.

     welles looks at amy.

                             welles
                 promise you won't go back there,
                 wherever you were.  whatever it was,
                 forget it.

     welles takes a deep breath, nods his head.

                             amy
                 promise me.

     welles looks out into the night sky of stars.

                             welles
                 i promise.

     amy comes to kiss welles.  welles wraps his arms around her
     and holds her tight.  she holds him.
