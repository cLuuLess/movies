     int.  welles' ford -- day -- continuous

     welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out, over and
     over again, wiping at his tears.  he lets out a little high-
     pitched whine from far back in his throat...

                             welles
                 why... why... ?

     he's wracked by sobbing.
