     ext.  dairy queen restaurant -- day

     welles and mrs. mathews eat at a picnic table on the patio.

                             welles
                 it's very important you don't let
                 this raise your expectations.  it's
                 not going to effect any ongoing
                 efforts.  all i'm saying is, please
                 know, i'm not here to create any
                 false hope.

                             mrs mathews
                 they hired you.  you're like, a
                 private detective?

                             welles
                 that's exactly what i am.

     mrs. mathews chews, staring off into the distance.

                             mrs mathews
                 i didn't think there were private
                 detectives anymore, except on tv.

                             welles
                 you probably expect me to be wearing
                 a trench coat and a hat.  drinking
                 whiskey, chasing women and getting
                 beaten up by guys with broken noses.
                 want to know what it's really like? 
                 it's sitting in a car and staring at
                 a hotel window for three days
                 straight, pissing in a plastic
                 bottle, pardon me, because some guy
                 thinks his wife's cheating on him.
                 glamorous, huh?  and the guy who
                 hired you, he has a hair-lip,
                 dandruff and crooked teeth, and you
                 could have told him the minute you
                 laid eyes on him his wife's
                 cheating, and you don't blame her.

     mrs. mathews smiles.

                             welles
                 it's refreshing to actually sit down
                 and meet someone face to face,
                 someone nice like you.

     welles smiles.  mrs. mathews takes out a cigarette.  welles
     lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.

                             welles
                 so, she didn't leave a note?  she
                 never gave any indication where she
                 might go, before she left?

                             mrs mathews
                 no.

                             welles
                 she just seemed... depressed... ?

                             mrs mathews
                 she didn't seem herself.  for months
                 there never was any way to get her
                 to talk about it.  one night we went
                 to bed... the next morning she was
                 gone.  she took some clothes.

                             welles
                 what was she running from?

                             mrs mathews
                 i don't know.

                             welles
                 if there's anything you feel
                 uncomfortable talking about, tell
                 me, but i have to ask.  your
                 husband... he committed suicide?

                             mrs mathews
                 yes.

                             welles
                 september 4th, 1993.  about a year
                 after mary disappeared.

                             mrs mathews
                 we were divorced by then.  things
                 fell apart... he was living with a
                 friend...

                             welles
                 why do you think he did it?

                             mrs mathews
                 it got to be too much for him.

                             welles
                 you have to forgive me, but in these
                 circumstances... with your
                 daughter...
                       (pause)
                 were there any indications of... any
                 sort of abuse?

                             mrs mathews
                 there wasn't anything like that.
                 the police and the fbi people asked,
                 but there wasn't anything happened
                 like that, never.  my husband... his
                 heart broke when mary left...

                             welles
                 i didn't mean to...

                             mrs mathews
                 you try going through what we did.
                 bob couldn't take it, that's all.
                 christ, there's times when it still
                 seems like i can't either.

                             welles
                 i had to ask.  i apologize.

                             mrs mathews
                 no one knows what it's like.  you
                 can't even imagine how much it hurts. 

     welles is miserable.  a few customers walk past, looking at
     mrs. mathews.  she tries not to notice then noticing.

                             mrs mathews
                 people remember me from the news.
                       (pause)
                 can you drive me back now?

                             welles
                 of course.
