     int.  office -- day 

     an old money office with windows over the river.  a well-to-
     do politician looks unhappily through photos on his desk.
     welles sits by the pennsylvania state flag, watching.

     photos show the young republican and gaudy woman in miami:
     leaving the art deco hotel, the discotheque, a restaurant...

                             welles 
                 your son-in-law dealt with the dry
                 cleaning franchise during the day,
                 saw that woman every night. 
                       (clears his throat) 
                 the specifics are in the report, and
                 information about the woman.  it's
                 unpleasant, i know.  i apologize... 

                             politician 
                 none too discreet, is he? 

                             welles 
                 no, sir, he is not. 

                             politician 
                 he's an imbecile.  i tried to warn
                 my daughter, but what can you do? 

     the politician shakes his head in disgust.  welles rises. 

                             welles 
                 the um... you'll find my invoice in
                 the envelope. if that's all...

                             politician 
                 yes, mister welles, thank you. 

                             welles 
                 certainly, senator.  if i can ever
                 be of further assistance.

     welles leaves, glances back, shuts the door.
