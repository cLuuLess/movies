     int.  dino velvet's office -- day

     thug opens the door and lets welles and max in.
     the office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of
     pictures from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned
     up to form an indecipherable collage.  a tall ladder leans
     against one wall, near three televisions.

     dino velvet rises behind his desk, a small, bird-like man,
     wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.

                             dino velvet
                 come in.  make yourself comfortable.

     welles shakes dino's hand.  max looks up at the walls.
     images; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy
     photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.

                             welles
                 it's an honor to meet you.  thank
                 you for seeing us.

                             dino velvet
                 what can i do for you today?

     welles sits.  shelves behind dino's desk are piled high with
     video cassettes, old movie cameras, big reels of 16mm film.
     videos and magazines are stacked everywhere.

                             welles
                 i'd like to commission a work.  i'm
                 a great admirer of yours.

                             dino velvet
                 flattering.  and, who's your
                 colorful little chum?

                             welles
                 a fellow investor.

                             dino velvet
                 hmm.

                             max
                 you're the only one still shooting
                 film and transferring it to video.
                 nobody appreciates that kind of
                 integrity anymore... the grain, the
                 gritty look you get.

                             dino velvet
                 well, i'm glad you appreciate it.
                       (to welles)
                 what would you say is your favorite
                 piece?

     welles considers.  max glances over, looks back to the walls.

                             max
                 i know if i had to pick, it'd be
                 "choke," or "devil."

                             welles
                 "devil" frightened me as much as it
                 excited me, but i'd be hard pressed
                 to choose a favorite.

     dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.

                             dino velvet
                 you said something about money.

                             welles
                 yes.  what we're looking for is
                 rather specific.

     welles takes out an envelope, puts it on the desk.

                             welles
                 that's five thousand dollars.

                             dino velvet
                 is it?

                             welles
                 five thousand now, five thousand on
                 delivery. 
                 two women, one white and one black,
                 as long as they have large breasts.
                 hard bondage, or course.  other than
                 that, trusting your artistic
                 interpretation, i have only two
                 stipulations.

                             dino velvet
                 and they are?

                             welles
                 i want to watch you work.

                             dino velvet
                 i'll consider it.

                             welles
                 and the other performer... it has to
                 be that monster you use... the man
                 in the mask.

                             dino velvet
                 machine.

                             welles
                 if it's not him, there's no deal.

     dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.

                             dino velvet
                 he might be interested... but it
                 would mean another five thousand.

                             welles
                 we can do that.

                             dino velvet
                 well, well, i'll have to put my
                 thinking-cap on about all this.
                 you'll leave the money as a deposit?
                       (off welles' nod)
                 very good.

     dino stands, picks up a still camera off his desk and comes
     to look at welles, studying him.

                             dino velvet
                 you have a beautiful face... the way
                 the light hits it.  i'd like to take
                 your picture.  you don't mind?

                             welles
                 i'd rather you didn't.

                             dino velvet
                 what's the problem? 

                             welles
                 i'm camera shy.

                             dino velvet
                 you trust me to keep your money, but
                 not to take your picture?

                             welles
                 those are two different kinds of
                 trust.
                       (stands)
                 thank you for your time.  i hope we
                 can do business.

     welles leaves.  max goes with him.  dino watches them leave.
