     int. welles' room -- night -- montage

     welles has the 8mm film threaded through the projector.  he
     turns the clattering projector on and sits, watching.

     on the wall: flash frames, then... the skinny girl in a
     negligee, sitting on the bed.  the camera's spotlight casts
     long shadows.  the girl stares, oblivious...

     on the wall: a door opens behind the girl, looks like a
     bathroom, and the masked man enters, wearing the ghastly
     wrestling mask.  the man goes to stand in front of the
     girl.  he seems to be saying something.  the film halts.

     welles sits forward, hand on the projector.  he's seen
     something.  he plays the film in reverse...

     on the wall: the masked man walks backwards, away from the
     girl, backwards into the bathroom, door shutting...

     welles stops the projector, not taking his eyes from the
     image.  he advances the film frame by frame...

     frame by frame... as the bathroom door opens, and the masked
     man enters... frame by frame... as the masked man moves
     forward... door closing behind him... stop...

     freeze frame: a third man is reflected in the bathroom
     mirror.  grainy and blurred, but he's in the room with the
     girl, standing there, captured in the mirror in this one
     brief instant just before the bathroom door closes.

     welles walks to take a closer look, studying the almost
     ethereal image of the third man.
