     int.  welles' room -- night

     welles puts mary's suitcase on the bed, opens it.  he takes
     out some of mary's clothing, examines it, lays it aside.

     he takes out a rosary, more clothing.  resting on a sweater
     are two ceramic figurines; a teddy bear and kitten.  welles
     examines them, frowning, puts them aside.

     he takes out yellowed newspaper; help wanted classifieds,
     "july 2, 1992."  several job possibilities circled, others
     crossed out.  he finds baggie containing a few old joints.

     all that's left are more items of clothing, a toothbrush and
     an address book.  welles examines the address book, finds a
     folded piece of paper in the blank pages, unfolds it... it's
     the torn diary page, a poem written in mary's hand...

                             mary's voice (v.o.)
                       (as welles reads)
                 "star light, star bright, first star
                 i've seen tonight, wish i may, wish
                 i might, have this wish i wish
                 tonight."

     welles goes to a drawer, takes out the photocopy of mary's
     diary.  he turns to the ragged edge of the torn page, puts
     the diary page against it.  perfect match.

     welles stands looking at the poem.  he turns the page over,
     finds written, in cursive:

                           models wanted 213-555-6643
