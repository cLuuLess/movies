     int.  harrisburg international airport -- night

     passengers arrive.  welles is with them, searching the few
     people waiting in the terminal hallway.  welles smiles...

     welles' wife, amy, smiles when she sees him.  she's plain
     and pretty, holding one hand on a baby stroller beside her.
     welles comes to her, embracing her, appreciating her.

                             amy
                 welcome home.

                             welles
                 do you know how much i missed you?

     they kiss, but amy pulls away, sniffs him.

                             amy 
                 what's this... have you been
                 smoking... ? 

                             welles 
                 smoking?  i'm not smoking. 

                             amy 
                 your clothing reeks of it. 

                             welles 
                 you know, amy, i've been sitting
                 around in bars and everywhere
                 following this guy... i mean, is
                 this what i get first thing?  before
                 you even "hello," you accuse me... ?

                             amy 
                 i'm not accusing you... 

                             welles 
                 well, i'm not smoking, okay? 

                             amy 
                 okay, i believe you. 

                             welles 
                 we've been all through that.  i've
                 been on my best behavior.

     welles bends to the stroller, picks up his infant daughter,
     cindy, and hoists her in the air, overjoyed. 

                             welles 
                 hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss
                 me?  i sure missed you... 

     he kisses the happy child, holding her in one arm. 

                             welles 
                 let's get my bags and get the hell
                 out of here. 

     welles pulls amy close and kisses her again, leads the way.
     amy follows, pushing the stroller. 

                             amy 
                 how's the detective business?

                             welles 
                 business was fine.  i'll tell you
                 what, you couldn't pay me enough to
                 live down there. 

                             amy 
                 you better not be smoking, that's
                 all i can say. 

                             welles 
                 honey, i'm not, please... 

     amy takes welles hand, smiling at him.
