     ext.  church, soup kitchen -- day -- montage

     a long line of homeless persons trails out the door.  welles
     stands out front, showing the picture to a volunteer with a
     broom, and a priest...

                 "dear diary.  something terrible
                 happened today when dad and i were
                 alone.  i can't tell anyone.  i feel
                 sick.  what did i ever do to make
                 this happen to me?"

     the volunteer and priest can't help.  welles is weary,
     futility beginning to wear on him, walks to his car...

                 "dear diary.  my stomach hurts all
                 the time.  i just want to go to
                 sleep and never wake up.  i want to
                 get out of my head and stop hearing
                 myself think."
