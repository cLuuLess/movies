     int.  welles' car -- day

     dawn light is just breaking.  welles has fallen asleep,
     slumped low behind the wheel, snoring lightly.

     welles awakens with a start, looking around, confused.  he
     calms, rubbing his eyes, wiping sweat from his features.

     across the street

     the quaint house's garage door begins to rise.

     in the car

     welles sees this, keeps low, watching...
     the big car backs out into the street.  the old woman's
     behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone.

     welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.

     on the street

     welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind
     him.  he starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all
     directions, making sure no one's around.

     ahead, the garage door begins to close.

     welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too
     conspicuous.  the garage door's halfway down...

     welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get
     there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.

     above

     in one window of the quaint house, an eyeball is peering out
     from lacy curtains, then moves away and curtains fall shut.
