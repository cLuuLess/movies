     ext.  all night coffee shop -- night

     max and welles comes out to the sidewalk, talking.

     across the street

     inside a parked car, through the windshield, someone watches
     max and welles say goodnight.  max walks to a waiting taxi.

     it's the sinister lawyer watching, longdale, the late mr.
     christian's attorney, watching welles go to his rental car.
