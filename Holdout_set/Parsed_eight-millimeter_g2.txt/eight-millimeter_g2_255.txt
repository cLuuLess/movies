     int.  kitchen -- day

     welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen, pointing his
     gun.  no one here.  the decor is feminine, neat and tidy.
     it's grandma's house, and it shows, with gaudy print
     wallpaper everywhere, every shelf displaying hummel
     figurines or collectors plates.  very home shopping network.
