     int.  welles' car -- continuous -- day

     welles drives, face caked in dried blood, cellular phone to
     his ear.  the highway rushes past out the car window.

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 amy, just listen.  take cindy and
                 get out of the house.  do it now.
                 go to a hotel and stay there...

                             amy (v.o.)
                       (from phone)
                 what's wrong?  are you alright?

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 i'm okay.  please, honey, i can't
                 explain.  don't use the phone, just
                 pack a bag and get out.  i'm on my
                 way.  i'll be back at the house in
                 three hours.  call me from the hotel
                 when you get there

                             amy (v.o.)
                 ... what's going on?

                             welles
                 just do it, amy, please, go.
