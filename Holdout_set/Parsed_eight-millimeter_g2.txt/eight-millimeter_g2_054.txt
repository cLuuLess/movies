     int.  missing person archive, file room -- day -- montage

     welles is tired, unshaven.  he's moved on to the physical
     files, at one table, looking through hundreds of missing
     person bulletins.  secretaries tend to other files. 

                             welles (v.o., cont)
                 it's okay for yours and your
                 husbands fingerprints to be on the
                 film, but you'll have to use me as
                 a middleman if you go to the police.
                 that way i don't have to explain why
                 my prints are on it...
