                             mary's voice (v.o., cont)
                 "dear diary.  it's happening all the
                 time now.  there s nothing i can do.
                 i'm all alone.  everything is bad.
                 i used to have lots of dreams and
                 i'd remember them when i woke up,
                 but that doesn't happen anymore."

     pull back: still following welles' car, over the freeway...

                             mary's voice (v.o., cont)
                 "dear diary.  if i can get to
                 california, i'll be okay.  i've got
                 money saved.  i can work as a
                 waitress till i get something
                 better.  billy says he and his
                 family went to california once on
                 vacation.  he says it never rains.
                 they stayed near the beach and he
                 went swimming in the ocean..."

     continue to pull back -- till welles' car is very, very far
     below -- revealing the staggering size of the city of los
     angeles, where the lights go on forever and forever.
