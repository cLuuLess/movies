     ext.  soho streets -- day

     pedestrians everywhere.  streets are clogged with delivery
     trucks loading and unloading.  cars horns blow.  welles
     walks to an old, warehouse building shoulder to shoulder
     with other buildings, labeled "1204" in burnished steel.

     welles climbs the stairs, examines the buzzers.

     the top button's labeled "greystone imports," the bottom
     button reads "lang interior design, by appt."  the middle
     button is labeled only by a drawing of a black widow spider.

     welles looks up at the building.
