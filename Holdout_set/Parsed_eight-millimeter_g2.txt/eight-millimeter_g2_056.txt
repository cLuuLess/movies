     int.  welles room, bathroom -- night -- end montage

     welles has the 8mm film threaded into his photo enlarger,
     projecting the image we just saw down onto the baseboard.

     he re-frames, closer on the masked man's hand, refocusing...
     the black spot is a little clearer, looks like a small star
     tattoo on the back of masked man's hand.
