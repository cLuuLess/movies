     ext.  queens street -- day

     a relatively quiet residential street.  homes are small, two
     story affairs, close together, each very much like its
     neighbor, some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls.

     welles' ford comes slowly down the street.  children in
     school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups.

     welles parallel parks.

     in the car

     welles turns off the engine.
     he's watching a house on the other side of the street.  the
     house is brick on the bottom, aluminum siding on top,
     quaint, with brick staircase from the front door down to a
     garage underneath, plastic pink flamingos on the small lawn.

     cars pass in the street.  welles watches school children
     pass on the near sidewalk.  he slumps down a little in his
     seat, adjusting the rearview mirror, adjusting his side
     mirror, rolling up the window.

     welles takes a cautionary look around, takes out his gun,
     pours bullets out and pockets them.  he picks up a paper bag
     off the passenger seat and opens it.

     he takes out a long, thin metal file, pulling off the shrink
     wrap packaging, feels the file with his thumb.

     keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel, welles
     slides the file into the barrel, scraping gently all along
     the gun's inner barrel.

                                              dissolve to:
