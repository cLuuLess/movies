     int.  motel, max's room -- night

     max enters with welles, turns on a light and throws his
     suitcase on the bed.  the room is disgusting.

                             max
                 you didn't say it was gonna be this
                 luxurious.

                             welles
                 it's their presidential suite.

                             max
                 great.

     max looks in the bathroom.

                             max
                 oh, come on, man, what are we doing
                 in this flea bag?

                             welles
                 it's cheap, and people know to mind
                 their own business. what have you
                 got for me? 

     max opens his suitcase, takes out three video tapes.

     he hands them to welles.  the boxes are covered in jumbled
     photo collages: american flag, s+m men and women, a skull,
     mannequins, a scorpion, cut-outs of arms, legs and eyeballs.

                             max
                 dino velvet.
