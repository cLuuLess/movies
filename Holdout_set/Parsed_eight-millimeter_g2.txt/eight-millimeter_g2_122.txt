                 to the penny.  exactly one million
                 dollars in cash. 

     welles considers this, lost in thought.

                             mrs christian (v.o.)
                 hello... ?

                             welles
                 i'm here.

                             mrs christian (v.o.)
                 do you think the film could have
                 cost that much?

                             welles
                 for a human life... murder on film,
                 no statute of limitations.  who
                 knows?  it sure could have.  i'd
                 like you to overnight me a copy of
                 those checks, then put them in a
                 safe deposit box. 

                             mrs christian (v.o.)
                 okay.

                             welles
                 send it to me through the post
                 office like we arranged.  no return
                 address.  you dug this up all by
                 yourself?

                             mrs christian (v.o.)
                 you told me to look, so i looked.

                             welles
                 you're one hell of a detective, mrs.
                 christian.
