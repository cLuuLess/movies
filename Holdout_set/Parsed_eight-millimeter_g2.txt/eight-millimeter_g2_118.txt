     int.  welles' room -- night -- montage

     welles is seated, projector running, watching the 8mm film.

     the last of the film makes its way through, threading out.
     the take-up reel spins, the film's tail flapping...

     welles stares at the blank white square of light projected
     onto the wall.  cellular phone is heard ringing...

     welles finally looks to the projector, turns it off.  the
     phone's ringing.  welles goes to sit on the bed, looking at
     the cellular phone on the bedside table.  ringing...

     welles lets it ring.  ringing... ringing... till it finally
     stops.  welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes.
