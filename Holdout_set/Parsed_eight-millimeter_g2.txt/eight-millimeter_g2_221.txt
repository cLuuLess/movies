     int.  eddie's living room -- day

     welles returns, goes to grasp eddie by the shirt collar,
     drags him to the floor, face down.  welles stands on eddie's
     neck, uses the knife to cut the duct tape on eddie's hands.

                             eddie
                 that's right, motherfucker, cut me
                 loose.  be a man.

     welles tosses the knife, gun trained on eddie, picks up the
     thomas guide and throws it at eddie... 

                             welles
                 show me!

     eddie, hands now free, pushes himself to a seated position,
     looks at the thomas guide.

                             welles
                 show me where you did it, on the
                 map, exactly where you did it.

                             eddie
                 why?

                             welles
                 because we're going there.
