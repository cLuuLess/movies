     welles shoves the door aside.  the door's hinge breaks and
     the door falls...

     eddie sits propped up against one wall, turns to look...

     the door slams to the floor.

     welles moves forward, enraged, closing on eddie, raising his
     arm with the gun grasped by the butt...

     eddie's eyes go wide with fear...

     welles swings the gun down at eddie's head...
