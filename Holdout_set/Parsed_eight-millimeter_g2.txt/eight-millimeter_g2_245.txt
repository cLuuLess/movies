     int.  motel room -- night

     welles sits at a small desk, looking through a phone book,
     white pages, finds... "hospitals."

     welles picks up the phone, chooses a number, dials it...

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 hello, can you connect me with the
                 duty nurse?
                      (waits)
                 hello, this is lieutenant anderson
                 down here in the thirteenth
                 precinct.  i've got a helluva
                 problem i was hoping you could give
                 me a hand with.  we had a stabbing
                 incident a couple of days ago, and
                 it looks like the supposed victim
                 gave us a false name and address.
                 can you tell me if you had an adult
                 male with an abdominal wound in you
                 er in the last forty-eight hours?
                       (listens)
                 you'd remember this guy; a body-
                 builder, real big guy, five foot
                 eleven, with acne all over his chest
                 and back...
                       (listens)
                 alright, thanks for your help. 

     welles hangs up, uses a pen to cross out a number in the
     phone book, starts dialing the next number.

                                              dissolve to:
