     int.  welles' house, kitchen -- night

     dark.  welles picks up the cordless phone, struggles to pry
     the receiver open.  he discovers another small bug.

     he drops the bugs to the floor, crushes them under foot.

     he puts the phone back together and is replacing it when it
     rings loudly.  welles is startled, drops the phone...

     welles takes a breath, trying to shake off the jitters.  he
     picks up the ringing phone, answers it...

                             welles
                       (into phone)
                 honey... ?

                             machine (v.o.)
                       (from phone)
                 not quite.

     welles stiffens.

                             machine (v.o.)
                 nothing like getting home after a
                 rough day.  home sweet home.

     welles moves into the hall, towards the front door...

                             machine (v.o.)
                 walk away.  pack your bags, put the
                 wife and kid in the car and find a
                 place to hide.  if you're lucky,
                 you'll never see me again.

     welles takes out his gun, opens the front door, looking out.
     the street in front of the house is empty.  crickets chirp.

                             welles
                 i don't know if i can do that.

                             machine (v.o.)
                 i know who you are.  i know where
                 you live.  i know everything i need
                 to know to find you.
                       (pause)
                 who am i?

     machine is heard hanging up the phone.
