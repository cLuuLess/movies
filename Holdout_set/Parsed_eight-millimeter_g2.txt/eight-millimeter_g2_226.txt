     ext.  big bear motor lodge -- night

     welles' car comes down the driveway, into a small lot.

     in the car

     through the windshield: headlights reveal what's left of the
     abandoned motor lodge, a registration office at the center
     with attached wings of rooms on both sides.

     the left wing of rooms is a fire ravaged, burnt-out
     skeleton.  what remains of the office and right wing is
     boarded over, falling apart.  no window has gone unbroken.

     in the lot

     welles turns out headlights and parks.
     he gets out, walks to look up the driveway.  a car is heard.
     headlights can be seen a good distance away through the
     forest as the car passes.

     welles goes to his car, unlocks the trunk and opens it.
     eddie's lying in there, arms and legs bound, gagged.
