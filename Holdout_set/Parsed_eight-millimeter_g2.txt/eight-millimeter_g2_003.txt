     int.  taxi -- day

     welles gets in, turning in his seat to watch behind.

                             cab driver
               where to?

     welles keeps watching, sees the limo pull away and pass.

                             welles
               follow that limousine.  don't get
               too close, don't let it get too far
               away.  just keep with it.

                             cab driver
               you kidding?

                             welles
               nope.

     the cab set in motion.  welles takes out cigarettes,
     lighting one, takes out a small notepad and makes notations.

                             cab driver
               uh, listen... you're not supposed to
               be smoking in here.  i'm sorry,
               that's company policy...

                             welles
               how about this... every cigarette i
               smoke, i give you five dollars?

                             cab driver
               okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good...
