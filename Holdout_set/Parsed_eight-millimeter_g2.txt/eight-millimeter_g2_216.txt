     int.  eddie's kitchen -- day

     welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying eddie's gun.  at
     the sink, welles pops the gun's clip.  he pushes the bullets
     out into his palm, one by one.

     he dumps the bullets into the garbage disposal, drops the
     clip in, turns it on.  the disposal makes a terrible
     grinding noise, straining, till it finally goes dead.
