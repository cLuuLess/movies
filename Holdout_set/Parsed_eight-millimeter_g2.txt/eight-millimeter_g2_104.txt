     int.  adult bookstore -- day

     welles comes in through the blacked-out door.  this place is
     larger than the last.  two clerks are behind the counter.
     one clerk's pricing porn, the other, max, 25, reads a porno-
     novel.  max has long hair, colorful tattoos covering his
     forearms, has a highlighter marker in his mouth.

     welles browses.  there's a huge video bargain bin.  walls
     are covered in videos, sex toys, inflatable women, etc. 

     customers, again all wary males, follow proper porn-shop
     etiquette; look at the porn, not your fellow shopper.

     there are "peep show" booths in the back.  a man looks
     around, trying to be nonchalant, sweating profusely,
     slipping behind one curtain.

     welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple-pack of
     dildos, looks towards the front...

     behind the register, max takes a look to make sure the other
     clerk is busy, takes the cap of his highlighter pen and
     highlights a section in the book he's reading.

     welles notes this.  he goes to the substantial magazine
     rack, picks up a porn tabloid, pages through it.  he selects
     sex magazines and newspapers, choosing about twenty-five.

     welles takes this pile up to max, gets out his wallet.  max
     starts ringing everything up.

                             max
                 big date tonight?

                             welles
                       (embarrassed)
                 yeah... guess so.

                             max 
                 can i interest you in a battery
                 operated-vagina?

                             welles
                 pardon me?

                             max
                 my boss tells me i have to do more
                 suggestive selling.

                             welles 
                 well, it's tempting, but no thanks.

                             max
                 it's your call, but you're gonna be
                 sorry when you're in one of those
                 everyday situations that call for a
                 battery-operated vagina and you
                 don't have one.

                             welles
                 i'll risk it. 

     max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over.

                             max
                 thank you for shopping at adult
                 bookstore.  have a nice day.

     welles takes the bag.  max returns to his book.  welles is
     leaving, but stops at the end of the counter.

                             welles
                 what are you reading?

     max holds up the book, "anal secretary."

                             max
                 once you pick it up you can't put it
                 down.

                             welles
                 catchy title.  what are you really
                 reading?
                       (off max's look)
                 hard to believe that book's got any
                 parts worth highlighting.

     max takes a glance at the other clerk, opens the pages of
     the book and shows it to welles.  "music for chameleons."

                             welles
                 truman capote.

                             max
                 i tear off the cover and paste this
                 one on...
                       (nods towards clerk)
                 you know how it is.

                             welles
                 wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
                 in front of your fellow perverts.

                             max
                       (smiles, shrugs)
                 might get drummed out of the
                 pornographer's union, and then where
                 would i be?

     another customer clears his throat, waiting at the register.
     max turns to help him.  welles heads out.
