     int.  dino velvet studio -- day

     the doors buzz and welles and max warily enter this large,
     dark, converted warehouse.  square pillars shoot from floor
     to ceiling.  shafts of light cut down from high windows.

     a large thug in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far desk.

                             thug
                 you're in the wrong place.

                             welles
                 we're looking for mr. velvet.

                             thug
                 he's not here. 

     welles looks around, at piles of props; a huge faux-stone
     angel and gargoyles, elaborate candelabras, a huge birdcage,
     massive wooden cross, nazi flags.

                             welles
                 why don't you tell him we're here to
                 give him a large sum of money.  if
                 he's not interested, we'll go.

                             thug
                 you should leave now, before i have
                 to remove you.

     welles just stands looking at the thug.  a voice is heard...

                             dino velvet's voice (v.o.)
                       (from speakers)
                 show them in, milo.

     welles and max look up.  there are speakers mounted high up
     on the pillars, and surveillance cameras looking down.

                             welles
                 you heard the boss, milo.

     the disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards
     a distant door.  welles and max follow...

     they notice an elaborate set built in one corner, a torture
     chamber, complete with rack and iron maiden.
