     int. christian house, mr christian's office -- night

     mrs. christian and welles enter.  this office has been lived
     in for a lifetime.  giant desk.  american flag.  walls
     covered in old b+w photographs and achievements. a large,
     baked enamel sign nailed up, "christian steel." 

                             mrs christian 
                 his inner sanctum. 

     welles looks up at the oil painting over the fireplace: mr.
     christian, a powerful, old man, posed with a dark, teeming,
     industrial landscape behind him. 

                             mrs christian 
                 not many people have been inside
                 this room. 

     welles examines photos of mr. christian visiting various
     steel plants, coal mines and ground-breaking ceremonies,
     shaking hands with workmen, with politicians. 


                             welles 
                 pittsburgh? 

                             mrs christian 
                 mostly.  that's where he started his
                 empire building.
                       (looks up at portrait)
                 he was a good man.  notorious as an
                 eccentric, but that was something he
                 cultivated.  he wanted to be
                 legendary.

                             welles 
                 he succeeded. 

                             mrs christian 
                 we were married forty-five years.
                 hard even for me to imagine.  we had
                 our troubles.  there were plenty of
                 places for him to be other than
                 here, but he was always loyal to me,
                 and i to him.  i loved him deeply.

     welles waits. 

                             mrs christian 
                 do you carry a gun, mr. welles? 

                             welles 
                 i wear a gun when i can tell a
                 client expects me to.  other than
                 that, there's never any reason. 

                             mrs christian 
                 just curious. 

     mrs. christian crosses to take down a picture, revealing a
     wall safe.  the safe is ajar, burnt and scarred, broken into.

                             mrs christian 
                 my husband was the only one with the
                 combination to this safe.  i knew
                 about it, but as far as i was
                 concerned it was none of my
                 business.  not till now, that is. 

                             welles 
                 you hired someone to open it.  i'll
                 bet the lawyer loved that.

                             mrs christian 
                 there was nothing he could do.  my
                 husband left everything to me.
                       (looks at safe)
                 i prevented anyone from seeing the
                 contents.  i felt these were my
                 husband's private things.  i
                 didn't... i didn't realize... 

                             welles 
                 do you want to tell me what you
                 found? 

                             mrs christian 
                 cash, stock certificates, and this...

     she takes something from her pocket, puts it on the desk: a
     plastic bag containing a short 8mm film on a plastic reel.

                             mrs christian 
                 it's a film... of a girl being
                 murdered. 

                             welles 
                 i'm afraid i don't... 

                             mrs christian 
                 this is a movie showing a girl being
                 murdered.  she's sitting on a bed,
                 and a man rapes her... and he begins
                 to cut her with a knife...
                       (pause)
                 i only watched what i could.

     welles picks up the film, looks at it. 

                             mrs christian 
                 i didn't know what to think.  i
                 can't tell you how horrible it's
                 been, to know this belonged to my
                 husband.  to know that he watched
                 this... this atrocity.  but, i can't
                 go to the police...

                             welles
                 mrs. christian... please, will you
                 sit down a moment? 
                       (leads her to a chair) 
                 i want you to listen carefully.
                 what you're talking about is a
                 "snuff film."  but, from what i
                 know, snuff films are a kind of...
                 urban myth.  like, red light
                 district folklore.  there's no such
                 thing, i can assure you. 

     mrs. christian shakes her head. 

                             welles 
                 please, believe me.  this is
                 probably a stag film.  simulated
                 rape.  hard to stomach, and it might
                 seem real, but there are ways of
                 making it look realistic... fake
                 blood and special effects...

                             mrs christian 
                 no. 

                             welles 
                 if you were to study it you'd see
                 the camera cutting away... you'd see
                 the tricks they can play...

                             mrs christian 
                 i'm telling you it's not that. 

                             welles 
                 i'm sure it is. 
                       (smiles) 
                 it's probably something your husband
                 was given as a bad joke.  more than
                 likely he never even watched it. 

                             mrs christian 
                 will you watch it and see for
                 yourself? 

                             welles 
                 of course.  but, i'm certain it's
                 nothing to worry about.
