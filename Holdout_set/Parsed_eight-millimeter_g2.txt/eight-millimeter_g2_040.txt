     int.  welles' room, bathroom -- day

     red bulb in the light socket.  welles threads the 8mm film
     into his enlarger, still in white gloves.

     he flicks the enlarger on, projecting a sideways image down
     onto the enlarger's baseboard, focusing... it's the girl
     sitting on the bed, early in the snuff film.

     welles makes an adjustment to the enlarger's lens; framing
     tighter on the girl's face, refocusing.
