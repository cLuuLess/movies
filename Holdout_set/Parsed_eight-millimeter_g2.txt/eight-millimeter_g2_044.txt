                 fuck.

     he tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his
     car.  after a moment, the director comes out after him...

                             director 
                 excuse me... tom, hold on...

     welles looks back, walks back, glances down...
     makes sure he stands on the torn card, hiding it underfoot.

                             director
                 listen, maybe i can help after all.
