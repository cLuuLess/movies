     busy and crowded, but quiet.  welles places a massive tome
     down on a table:  "haines criss-cross directory."

     welles sits, takes out his notepad, referring to the phone
     number written: "(212) 555-9906."  he opens the reference
     book, searching pages...

     thousands of telephone numbers are listed in sequence, each
     with an address.  welles runs his finger down the page.
