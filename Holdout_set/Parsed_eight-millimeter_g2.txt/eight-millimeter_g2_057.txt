     int.  missing persons archive, file room -- day

     welles sits hunched over the card catalog, still unshaven,
     drinking coffee, flipping through smaller pictures of
     missing children in one drawer, one by one by one...

     welles rolls his neck.  he looks to see the archive's
     director in the doorway.  the director nods, leaving.
     welles gets back to it, stooped over the catalog.

                                              fade to black:

     title card:      three weeks later
