     int.  mathews house, living room -- night

     welles sits picking at fast food in front of him.  mrs.
     mathews' food isn't even unwrapped. 

     she's numb from her drink, watching a game show, smoking. 

                             welles
                 do you ever consider... do you
                 realize that mary may never come
                 back?

     mrs. mathews looks to welles, looks back at the tv.

                             mrs mathews
                 i think about it everyday.  but,
                 every time the phone rings... every
                 single time, i still think it's her.

                             welles
                 it's been six years.

                             mrs mathews
                 what am i supposed to do?  forget
                 her?  time heals all wounds, right?
                       (misery building)
                 she's all i think about, and i've
                 learned to live with that.  but, you
                 want the truth... the real truth?
                 if i had a choice... if i had to
                 choose, between her being out there,
                 living a good life and being happy,
                 and me not knowing; never finding
                 out what happened to her...
                       (pause)
                 ... or her being dead and me
                 knowing...
                       (pause)
                 i'd choose to know.

     mrs. mathews stares into the tv, wipes tears.
     welles takes a deep breath and holds it.  he watches her a
     long moment, motionless.  finally he stands, voice unsteady.

                             welles
                 excuse me, i have to use your
                 bathroom.
