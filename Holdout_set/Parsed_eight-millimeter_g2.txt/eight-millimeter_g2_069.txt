                 you should be able to take a shower
                 and still have hot water left, honey.

                 call him back and tell him i said
                 so.  the goddamn thing's still under
                 warranty.

                 i'm okay.  it's hard here.  it's
                 hard.

                 i've got a lead i have to follow
                 through.  to be honest, i don't
                 think i'm going to get very far.
                 i miss you.  i love you.
