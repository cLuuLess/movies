     ext.  phone booth -- day

     welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page,
     phone to his ear.  it rings, rings, rings... 

                             man's voice (v.o.) 
                       (from phone)
                 celebrity films.

     welles hangs up, begins searching the booth's yellow pages.
