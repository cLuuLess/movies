     int.  warehouse -- day

     the door is kicked open.  welles enters, takes the 8mm film
     out and holds it in his hand.  longdale follows.

     as welles moves forward, his face goes slack...

     machine is seated on the bed, eddie and dino stand smoking
     cigarettes, and further on, max is tied to the target,
     slumped over, three arrows in his chest.  dead.

                             welles
                 no!!

     welles runs towards max, crying out, tears in his eyes...

     machine rises, goes to intercept welles, grabbing him.
     welles tries to break free, but machine lifts welles up and
     throws him brutally to the ground.

     welles scrambles to get up...

                             welles
                 you fuckers!

     eddie comes to kick welles in the face.
     welles is sent sprawling, blood gushing from his nose.  he
     lays there, stunned, weeping.

     eddie pries the 8mm film from welles' hand, tosses it...

     dino catches the film.

     machine comes to drag welles towards the bed.

     dino unspools the film, holding it up to examine it.

     machine handcuffs welles to the metal bedframe.  welles
     falls to his knees, holding his face.
     eddie punches welles in the head.

                             eddie
                 you're a dead man.

                             dino velvet
                 leave him alone.

                             eddie
                 fuck off.

     eddie punches welles in the kidney.  welles tries to protect
     himself.  eddie raises his fist to punch again, but machine
     catches eddie's fist, throws eddie back...

                             eddie
                 what the fuck... !

                             dino
                 i promised him to machine.

     eddie looks up at machine, who towers over him.

                             eddie
                 ... sorry...

                             dino velvet
                 first things first.  you might want
                 to watch this, mr. welles...

     welles looks up through tears...
     dino drops the 8mm film on the floor, takes a small bottle
     of lighter fluid from his pocket.  longdale comes to watch.

     welles watches helpless, agonizing...

                             welles
                 don't... please...

     dino drops the film to the floor, sprays it with fluid,
     takes out matches, light one, drops it...

     the 8mm film goes up in flame...

     welles watches, quaking, hysterical, trying to pull himself
     towards the flame, dragging the bed...

     the film is destroyed by flame...

     welles gives up, presses his face to the floor, eyes shut.

                             dino velvet
                 and so it ends.  it's as if she
                 never existed.

     welles falls back, gasping, wiping blood and tears and
     spittle from his face, getting slowly, to his feet.

                             dino velvet
                 don't blame yourself.  you were in
                 way over your head.

     he looks to max's corpse, to the smoldering film...
     swallowing back his fear, panic and rage...

                             welles
                 motherfuckers.  small time,
                 motherfuckers... !  tell me
                 something...

     welles spits blood, hangs onto the bed for support.

                             welles
                 i know why you did it, dino,
                 eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do
                 it?  must have been a helluva lot of
                 money, right?  one fuckload of
                 money...

     welles sits on the bed, eyes burning with fury.

                             welles
                 so, what are you all still doing
                 small time, huh?  what are you still
                 doing in the sewer, eddie?!
                 christian gave longdale a million
                 dollars to find him a snuff film.
                 how much did you ever see... ?

     eddie and dino look to longdale.

                             eddie
                 what's he talking about?

                             welles
                 one million dollars, dino.  how much
                 did he tell you he had...

     longdale's getting very nervous.

                             longdale
                 he's lying.

                             welles
                 look at him.  you think he played it
                 square?  how much did he give you,
                 how much did he keep for himself?

     eddie walks towards longdale...

                             eddie
                 what the fuck's he talking about?

     longdale takes out his gun, aims it at machine, dino and
     eddie, scared...

                             longdale
                 stay away from me. 

                             dino velvet
                 what's going on, longdale?  did this
                 happen?

                             eddie
                 you sell us short, you fuck?

                             longdale
                 stay back!  you have a gun, eddie,
                 show it to me.  now!

     eddie slowly takes out his gun, seething.

                             longdale
                 put it on the ground, kick it here...

     eddie puts the gun down, kicks it...
     longdale picks it up, throws it far away.

                             eddie
                 you fucking lawyer...

                             longdale
                 move back!  all of you... move!

     machine, dino and eddie stand between longdale and the car
     with tinted windows parked across the warehouse...

                             dino velvet
                 what were you thinking?

     welles watches as machine, dino and eddie back slowly away
     from longdale.  longdale's gun hand is shaky...

     welles tries to drag himself towards the table where his gun
     and bullets are, dragging the bed, inch by inch...

     longdale back away, trying to angle around the menacing trio
     so he can get to the car...

                             longdale
                 back off!  everything's been taken
                 care of, and i'm leaving now...

                             dino velvet
                 you're not going anywhere if you
                 fucked us, lawyer.

                             longdale
                 i'm leaving.

                             eddie
                 you got the guts, tough guy?  gonna
                 kill us all, is that it?

                             dino velvet
                 you betrayed us.

                             longdale
                 stay where you are!

     machine edges forward, holding his hands in the air.
     longdale brandishes the gun...

                             longdale
                 keep back!

     machine, eddie and dino are held at bay...

                             dino velvet
                 you're not gonna live through this.

     welles still tries to get to the table, wrist bleeding in
     the cuff, bed screeching across the floor...

     machine, hands up, slowly reaches behind his shoulder,
     touches the handle of a huge knife sheathed to his back.

                             longdale
                 our business is done, i'm leaving,
                 no one's going to stop me...

     longdale glances towards the car, seems like he's about to
     make a run for it.  dino velvet takes a step forward...

                             dino velvet
                 fuck you!

     machine unsheathes the knife and throws...

     thunk!  the knife imbeds to the hilt in longdale's chest and
     longdale's gun fires...

     dino velvet flies backwards, shot in the face!

     dino hits the ground, screaming, writhing, hands to his
     face, blood pouring out between his fingers.

     longdale falls back onto his ass, sitting there, eyes bugged
     out in surprise.  he looks down at the knife in his chest.

     machine lets out a scream, runs to dino...

     machine falls to his knees and grips dino, tries to hold
     him.  dino's screaming, squirming frantically...

     longdale sits looking down at the knife in his chest, looks
     up, and gallons of blood pour from his mouth...

                             eddie
                 fuck.

     eddie comes to look down at the longdale.  longdale falls
     back, dead, blood still flowing from his maw.

     welles drags the heavy bed, getting closer to the table...

     eddie spins, looks across to see welles struggling...

     dino breaks free from machine, runs blindly, still holding
     his gushing face, falls, tries to get back up...

     eddie runs towards welles.

     dino stumbles forwards, writhing, then suddenly lays still.

     machine rises, looking at dino.  tears come out from
     machine's eyes and roll down his mask.

     one last gasp and shudder from dino's body; death rattle.

     welles pulls the bed, practically pulling his arm from the
     socket, desperately clawing towards the table...
     the table is mere feet away...

     eddie arrives, kick welles in the ribs...

     welles recoils.  eddies kicks again.  welles curls into a
     ball.  eddie kicks again...

                             machine (o.s.)
                 no!

     eddie stops, looks to machine.

                             machine
                 he's mine!

     machine strides over the longdale's corpse, puts his foot on
     longdale's chest, yanks out the knife...
     machine starts this way...

     eddie backs from welles.  welles looks up, trying to shake
     off unconsciousness, sees machine coming...

     welles bows down, on his knees, as if to accept his fate...
     reaching his free hand into his suit pocket...

                             welles
                 no, no, no... please, don't kill
                 me... please... !

     machine arrives, knife in hand, lifts welles' head back by
     the hair, brings the knife hand back...

                             eddie
                 do him good.

     welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, stabbing
     scissors deep in machine stomach...

     machine roars, falling back, pitching forward...

     machine's knife clatters to the ground.

     eddie's eyes go wide. 

     machine hits the floor, clutching his guts.

     welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron
     bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off...

     eddie moves forward, furious...

     welles grabs machine's knife, wielding it, holding eddie off.

                             welles
                 back off, eddie...

     welles drags the now lightened bed frame towards the table.
     eddie's sorely tempted, but keeps away.

     eddie turns, looks across the warehouse...

     there's his gun, lying there, far away.

     eddie runs for the gun.

     welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun,
     knocks the table over.  he's got the gun, but...

     bullets hit the floor as the table falls.

     welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand,
     gets it open, holds it between his knees...

     welles grabs a bullet...

     eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air...

     machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with
     trembling hands...

     welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises,
     taking aim across the warehouse...

                             welles
                 stop eddie!

     eddie's running...

                             welles
                       (pulls back the hammer)
                 i swear to christ i'll shoot you in
                 the back... !

     eddie stops, hands up, about ten feet from his gun...

     machine stays on his knees, holding his bleeding stomach.
     welles points his gun at machine.

                             welles
                 come back, or i put a hole in him.

     eddie's looking at his gun, so close, so far away.

                             welles
                 you might make it to your gun, but
                 not before i shoot machine.  and if
                 i have to shoot him because of you,
                 and i don't kill him, right after he
                 kills me, he's gonna kill you.

     eddie turns, starts walking back...

                             welles
                       (to machine)
                 take off the mask.

     machine shakes his head.

                             welles
                 take it off!

                             machine
                 you got one bullet.

     welles looks to see eddie heading back, keeps the gun on
     machine, backs away, dragging the bed frame, looks to the
     door behind him...

                             machine
                 the only choice you have now, is
                 which one of us kills you.

     welles backs away, drags the bedframe.  eddie's getting
     close.  welles points the gun at eddie.  eddie slows.

     welles points the gun at machine, points the gun at eddie.

     welles puts the gun to the chain of his handcuffs, fires...
     breaks the handcuff chain.

     welles bolts to the door...

                             machine
                 get the gun!

     eddie runs back towards his gun.
     machine rises with a grunt of pain, moves towards the door,
     but agony doubles him back over to his knees.
