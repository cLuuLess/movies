     int.  missing persons archive, file room -- day

     director leads welles into this research room, a small
     library with long tables, old computers, lots of file
     cabinets and card catalogs.  secretaries tend to the files.

                             director 
                 this is it.  it's not much. 
                       (points at computers) 
                 we've got less than five percent on
                 computer and we lose that funding in
                 december.  i'll have someone show it
                 to you anyway.  other than that, i'm
                 afraid it's the wet thumb method.

     welles looks to the many, many file drawers. 

                             director 
                 files are mostly by state and year
                 of disappearance.  we try to keep
                 the children and adults separate.
                 no eating or smoking in here, but
                 there's a coffee machine in the hall.

                             welles 
                 any good?

                             director
                 it's horrible, but it'll be your
                 best friend after a few days.  i
                 hope you realize what kind of long
                 shot you're chasing after. 

                             welles
                 you're gonna be seeing a lot of me.
                 you're sure you don't mind?

                             director 
                 it's good what you're doing.

     the director puts out his hand.  welles looks, shakes.
