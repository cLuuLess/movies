     ext.  1204 warehouse -- day

     welles comes out back doors into an sunless alleyway with
     fire escapes above.  there's a trash dumpster, overflowing.
     rats scatter upon welles, arrival.

     welles looks to make sure he's alone.  he starts tearing
     open garbage bags.  flies swarm.  one bag's filled with
     empty food containers and old newspapers.

     welles tears open another bag, finds burnt out florescent
     lightbulbs, digs out a handful of empty photo paper
     packages, bottles of developing chemicals.  he pulls out a
     few magazines; time, newsweek, etc...

     the magazines are cut up, falling apart, with pictures
     chopped out from many pages.  welles examines address labels:

     "dino velvet/d.v. films
      1204 keller street
      new york, ny 10049"
