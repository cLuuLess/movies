     int.  los angeles airport -- night

     welles stares ahead, in fresh shirt and suit, waiting at a
     check-in counter. 

     the female airline agent behind the counter types in her
     computer, stamps his ticket.

     welles shifts his gaze, something catches his eye...

     beside a stapler on the counter, a pair of scissors.

                             agent
                 there you are, mr. welles, confirmed
                 through to kennedy.  gate 32b.

     welles stares, fixated on the scissors.

                             agent
                 mr. welles?

     welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket.

                             agent
                 gate 32b.

     welles accepts the ticket.
