     ext.  hollywood hills -- night

     an old, dented car makes its way up the tight, twisting
     roads of the hollywood hills.  eddie's at the wheel.  not
     far behind, welles' rental car follows...

     further on

     eddie's car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a
     ramshackle house, parks.  welles' car passes by...

     further, around a curve

     welles' car slows once it's out of sight, turns around,
     moving back down the hill, slowly...
