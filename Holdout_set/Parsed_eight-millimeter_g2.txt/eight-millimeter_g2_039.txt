     int.  welles' room -- day

     pizza box on the bedside table.  welles' suits hang in the
     closet.  welles sits facing a small reel to reel on a desk.
     he wears white gloves, handles the 8mm film, careful to hold
     it by the edges, holding it up to the light, squinting.

     welles puts in a magnifying eyepiece, leaning close...

     welles' p.o.v. through magnifying lens: studying the first
     few inches of exposed film, coming upon tiny letters printed
     just below the sprocket holes: "supralux 544."
