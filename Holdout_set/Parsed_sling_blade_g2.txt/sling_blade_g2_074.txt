	int. wheatley house - night
	
	all the lights are out. we see a shot of frank in his bed
	asleep, but tossing and turning. then a shot of linda in bed
	staring at the ceiling and doyle beside her snoring.
	suddenly, the lights come on and linda lets out a little yelp
	and sits up, which wakes up doyle and he sits up with a
	start. from their p.o.v. we see karl standing in the door
	holding a hammer.
	
	                    doyle 
	          what in the goddamn hell are you
	          doin'? it's the middle of the
	          night.
	
	                    linda 
	          what do you want, hun?
	
	                    karl 
	          i want to be baptized.
	
	                    doyle 
	          baptized? well, get baptized then.
	          i don't give a shit. call a fuckin'
	          preacher, goddamnit! i can't
	          baptize you.
	
	                    linda 
	          we'll go to church and get you
	          baptized, tomorrow's sunday. you go
	          on back to bed.
	
	                    doyle
	          what are you doin' with that damn
	          hammer?
	
	                    karl

	          woke up a-holdin' it.
