	          watch. you go on.
	
	                    linda 
	          i'll be back in a little bit then.
	
	she leaves and doyle walks up to karl and frank.
	
	                    doyle 
	          i really just wanted to git your
	          mama out of the house for a minute
	          so we can have a talk. y'all set
	          down.
	
	they sit on the couch and doyle kneels in front of them.
	
	                    doyle 
	          now here's the deal. now that i'm
	          gonna throw my entire life away
	          doin' what i want to come live here
	          with y'all, we have to get a few
	          things straight. see, frank, me and
	          you mama wouldn't have any problems
	          if it wadn't for you. we'd never
	          have a bad word between us. but
	          since you do exist, if i'm gonna be
	          here as the head of the household,
	          we'll have to live by my rules.
	          and my rules are you don't speak
	          unless you're spoken to. stay out
	          of my way and do what a regular kid
	          does. you're a weird little shit. i
	          don't get you. so wake up. face
	          what they call reality. we're gonna
	          be a family now. and it's my
	          family. i'll be payin' the bills so
	          you got me. but i ain't your daddy.
	          you just treat me like i am. i'm
	          the boss, okay. and the other thing
	          is your friend karl has to go. we
	          can't have a normal family with him
	          livin' in the garage and comin' in
	          the bedroom at four in the mornin'
	          with hammers and shit. see?
	
	                    frank
	          karl can stay if he wants to. mama
	          said --
	
	doyle slaps him across the face and karl grabs doyle's arm.
	doyle shakes him off.
	
	                    karl 
	          don't hit that boy no more.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you shut up you, fuckin' retard.
	          get your shit and get out of here. 
	              (to frank)
	          that was a wake-up slap, frank.
	          remember. reality, like i said.
	          don't forget any bit of what i said
	          to you and we'll be fine.
	
	frank jumps up and runs from the house and doyle sits back in
	his chair and pops a beer. karl gets up and goes to the
	garage.
