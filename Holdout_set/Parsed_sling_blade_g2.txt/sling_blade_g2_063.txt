	ext. junior high football field - day
	
	it's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. karl,
	frank, and two other boys around frank's age are huddled up.
	four boys are lined on defense. they break the huddle and
	come to the line. they are on about the fifty-yard line.
	frank hikes the ball to one of the boys. he later als it to
	karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run
	toward him. then he takes off like the wind. he runs funny,
	kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast. all the others
	are chasing him. two of the other team's boys catch him on
	about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. karl
	sees frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the
	ball just as karl bites the dirt. frank goes into the end
	zone untouched. there are cheers from frank and the other
	boys. frank runs over to karl who's still on the ground.
	
	                    frank 
	          way to go, karl. we got a
	          touchdown. that was a good lateral,
	          man. that was just like the
	          wishbone.
	
	                    karl 
	          i dern near had me a touchdown till
	          them boys got a-hold of me there so
	          i figured i better give it off to
	          you. i seen you over there
	          follerin' me.
	
	                    frank 
	          we're liable to win if we keep this
	          up. for somebody like you, you sure
	          run fast.
	
	he grabs karl by the hands and helps pull him up.
	
	                    frank (cont'd)
	          come on, let's kick off to 'em.
