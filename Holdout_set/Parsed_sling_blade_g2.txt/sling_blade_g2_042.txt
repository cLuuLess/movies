	int. garage - night
	
	karl sits on his cot eating from the plate frank brought him.
	frank and linda come through the door. frank comes and sits
	beside karl. linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and
	comes over and stands in front of karl.
	
	                    linda 
	          karl, now listen, there's gonna be
	          a party tonight here at the house.
	          doyle's invited his music-playin'
	          buddies over to make a bunch of
	          racket out on the patio.
	
	                    frank
	          they ain't even no good. the only
	          one can play is randy
	          horsefeathers. he claims he's an
	          indian. his real name's randy
	          collins and he works at the feed
	          mill. he can at least play guitar.
	
	                    linda
	          he's no more an indian than i am
	          though. anyhow, doyle's gonna try
	          and tease you and be mean to you to
	          show off to his friends. just like
	          he does to frank and me sometimes.
	          you just ignore it. or stay out
	          here away from 'em if he'll let
	          you. he's an okay guy till he gets
	          drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
	          i guarantee it.
	
	                    frank 
	          he ain't ever okay to me.
	
	the garage door opens and doyle appears. he seems really
	happy.
	
	                    doyle 
	          well, it's on! we're gonna rock.
	          linda, call vaughan. tell him to
	          get over here. i'd like him to be
	          here. i owe him a good time.
	
	                    linda 
	          no doyle. vaughan don't want to
	          come to a party with you.
	
	                    doyle 
	          too late, honey. fooled you. done
	          called him. he'll be here. 
	              (grins)
	          or i'll go get him. come on karl, i
	          need you to help me ice down a tub
	          of beer, you and frank.
