	ext. sidewalk - night
	
	karl and melinda are walking in the moonlight. it seems a
	little hard for melinda to keep up.
	
	                    melinda 
	          you walk fast, don't you?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon.
	
	they walk a little farther in silence.
	
	                    melinda 
	          these is the worst shoes i own for
	          walkin'. how far did you want to
	          go?
	
	                    karl 
	          i ain't really thought about it too
	          much i don't reckon.
	
	they walk until they disappear into the darkness.
