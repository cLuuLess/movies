	ext. street - day
	
	karl is walking down the street past rundown houses. he comes
	to an old gray woodframe house. it is in bad repair, the
	paint is peeling, the yard is grown up. there is an old
	wooden shed in the back yard. he stands looking at it for a
	moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the
	shed. he's motionless for a moment, then goes inside.
