	int. a hallway - day
	
	two young women, marsha dwiggins, carrying a briefcase, and
	theresa evans, carrying two camera bags are being led down
	the hallway by a guard.
	
	                    theresa 
	          i don't know why you're so weirded
	          out, this is not san quentin, it's
	          just a nuthouse. most of these
	          people don't even know where they
	          are, they're not gonna hurt you.
	
	                    marsha 
	          in a few minutes we're gonna be in
	          a room with a killer. that doesn't
	          bother you?
	
	                    theresa 
	          hey, you're the one that wanted to
	          major in journalism. anyhow, wasn't
	          the guy something like twelve or
	          thirteen when he did it, it was
	          twenty-five years ago, he probably
	          doesn't even remember it.
	
	                    marsha
	              (wrinkling her nose)
	          do you smell shit?
	
	                    theresa 
	          yeah.
	
	they reach a door and the guard ushers them through.
