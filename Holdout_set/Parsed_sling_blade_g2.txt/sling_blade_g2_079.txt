	ext. secret place - day
	
	frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a
	stick. he hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees
	karl coming toward him.
	
	                    frank
	          hey, karl. how'd you know to come
	          out here?
	
	                    karl 
	          i knowed you'd be here. 
	              (karl sits on the stump)
	          what are you a-doin' digging with
	          that stob?
	
	                    frank 
	          just diggin'. 
	              (pause)
	          i ain't ever gonna be happy now.
	          not with that son of a bitch movin'
	          in for good. i wish me and you and
	          mama could just run away. but she
	          said he would find us wherever we
	          went. he's crazy. sometimes i think
	          it would of been better if i wadn't
	          ever born.
	
	                    karl 
	          i'm glad of it you was borned. 
	              (pause)
	          i reckon i ain't gonna be there in
	          the garage no more.
	
	                    frank 
	          you have to karl. you have to look
	          out for me. you don't let that son
	          of a bitch run you off.
	
	                    karl 
	          you're just a boy. you ort not to
	          use that sort of language.
	
	                    frank 
	          karl, i ain't tryin' to say nothin'
	          bad about you, but why don't you
	          stop doyle when he gets that away?
	          you're older than him. you're
	          strong, too. my daddy wouldn't let
	          him do that to me and mama.
	
	                    karl 
	          that feller's a whole sight meaner
	          than me. he'd just whup the tar out
	          of me.
	
	                    frank 
	          yeah, i guess so. i'm real tired,
	          you know that. a kid my age
	          shouldn't be tired of things.
	
	                    karl 
	          i'm tired, too, frank. 
	              (pause)
	          if i ain't around no more, it don't
	          mean i don't care fer ye. i care
	          for ye a good deal. i care for you
	          more than anybody they is. we made
	          friends right off the bat.
	
	                    frank 
	          i care for you, too. but you'll be
	          around, don't say that.
	
	                    karl 
	          hit don't make no difference where
	          i was to be. we'll always be
	          friends. there ain't no way to stop
	          that. 
	              (pause)
	          i aim for you to have these books.
	
	he hands him the books.
	
	                    karl
	          maybe you can make more sense out
	          of them than i can.
	          i made you a little old book marker
	          and stuck it in that book on
	          christmas.
	
	                    frank 
	          you don't want to give away all
	          your books.
	
	                    karl 
	          i aim fer you to have 'em.
	
	                    frank 
	          man. thanks. 
	              (pause)
	          you know when you get a feelin' and
	          you don't know why?
	
	                    karl 
	          yes sir.
	
	                    frank 
	          i've got a feelin' today.
	
	                    karl 
	          reckon what kind of a feelin'?
	
	                    frank 
	          like something different. i don't
	          know. 
	              (pause)
	          you're leavin' ain't you, karl?
	
	                    karl 
	          will ye do somethin' for me if i
	          ast you to?
	
	                    frank 
	          you know i would. whatever you
	          want.
	
	                    karl
	          don't go home tonight and stay with
	          that doyle. he's got it in for ye
	          tonight. i got me a feelin', too.
	          feels like to me you ort not be
	          there in that house with him
	          liquored up and mean. ye mama
	          neither. when you get up from here,
	          i want you to go to that feller's
	          house. your mama's friend. i want
	          you to give me your word on it.

	          ever'thing gonna be okay? are you

	                    frank 
	          okay.
	
	karl lays his arm on frank's shoulder and frank puts his hand
	on karl's arm. they sit like that for a few moments, then
	karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. frank takes
	the book marker out of the christmas book. it is just a
	folded piece of notebook paper. on it is written 'you will be
	happy.' he looks up at karl who is now thirty yards away in
	the trees.
	
	                    frank (cont'd)
	          karl!
	
	karl turns around and he and frank stare at each other
	through the trees.
