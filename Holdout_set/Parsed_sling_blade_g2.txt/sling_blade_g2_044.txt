	int. doyle's truck - night
	
	doyle is driving, vaughan in the middle, and karl by the
	window. doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
	tape. the first few notes of "ghost riders in the sky" play.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          are you sure you can drive? you've
	          really had a lot of alcohol.
	
	                    doyle 
	          shhhh! this is the national anthem.
	
	they take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song
	goes louder.
