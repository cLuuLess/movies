	int. ben's dollar store - day
	
	frank and karl make their way through the fairly crowded
	store. it's sort of a mini-version of a walmart. they find
	frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red
	ben's knit shirt. they are laughing together and pricing some
	mouthwash. linda wheatley is a short, plain woman in her
	thirties. the man, vaughan cunningham, is in his forties,
	with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging
	over his belt. they eye karl suspiciously, as the boys
	approach.
	
	                    frank 
	          hey, mama. hey, vaughan.
	
	                    linda 
	          hey, sweetheart. what you up to?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          let me guess. you want a bunch of
	          candy and a pop.
	
	                    frank 
	          yeah.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          you're gonna rot your teeth that
	          way. but i bet i know what you
	          would like even better.
	          i put potted meat on special, four
	          cans for a dollar and they're not
	          moving very well. i'd sure let a
	          few cans go for free to the right
	          boy.
	
	                    frank 
	          i don't like potted meat. daddy
	          used to say it was made out of lips
	          and peckers and intestints.
	
	                    linda 
	          frank, don't talk that way. who's
	          that strange lookin' man behind
	          you? did he follow you in here?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          can i help you, sir?
	
	                    frank 
	          oh, that's karl. i met him at the
	          laundrymat. karl, this is my mama.
	          and vaughan, vaughan's the manager.
	          he lets mama off any time she feels
	          like it 'cause they're best
	          friends.
	
	                    linda 
	          nice to meet you, karl.
	
	                    karl
	              (keeping his distance)
	          pleased to know y'all.
	
	there's an uncomfortable silence.
	
	                    linda 
	          frank come back here with me for a
	          minute.
	
	she shuffles him away and leaves vaughan staring at karl.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          i don't think i've ever seen you
	          before.
	
	                    karl 
	          naw, i don't believe you have. i
	          don't reckon i never been in here.
	          this store didn't used to be here.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          it's been here seventeen years. did
	          you live here before or something?
	
	                    karl 
	          i's horned and raised here up till
	          i's twelve year old.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          what brings you back?
	
	                    karl 
	          what's that you say?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          why are you here now?
	
	                    karl 
	          they turned me loose from the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          is that right? 
	              (pause)
	          are you going to be staying here
	          long?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon mr. woolridge got me hired
	          on to work for bill cox's outfit.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          do you have family here?
	
	                    karl 
	          not really to speak of.
	
	linda and frank return from the back.
	
	                    frank 
	          hey karl, guess what. mama said you
	          can stay with us. out in the
	          garage. our car won't fit in there
	          anyway. it's real neat.
	
	                    linda 
	          frank told me about your situation.
	          and frank loves company. you know,
	          especially after his daddy passed
	          and all. there ain't no sense in
	          you stayin' in that old greasy
	          shop. 
	              (to vaughan, hushed)
	          he's mentally retarded, poor thing.
	
	                    vaughan
	              (hushed)
	          he just got out of the state
	          hospital.
	
	                    linda
	              (put out)
	          i know.
	
	                    frank 
	          can we get some candy and pops?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          sure, go ahead.
	
	they walk off down the aisle leaving vaughan a little
	puzzled.
	
	                    vaughan (cont'd)
	          are you sure it's safe to let him
	          around that guy?
	
	                    linda 
	          frank's just crazy about him. he
	          likes the way he talks. he helped
	          him carry home the clean laundry.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          he's been in the state hospital a
	          long time, something must be wrong
	          with him.
	
	                    linda 
	          he's retarded's all. you know he's
	          always after a father figure and
	          lord knows doyle ain't a good one
	          with his mean ass.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          what about me?
	
	                    linda 
	          i don't think he sees you as a guy
	          guy.
	
	                    vaughan
	              (wrinkles his brow)
	          karl is a guy guy?
