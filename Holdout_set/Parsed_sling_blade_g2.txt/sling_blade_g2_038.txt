	int. living room - night
	
	vaughan ushers karl in and they stand behind the sofa. doyle
	looks up and grins.
	
	                    linda 
	          hey, vaughan. how are you, karl?
	
	                    karl 
	          tolerable, i reckon.
	
	                    linda
	              (in a hurry to get out)
	          karl, this is my boyfriend, doyle.
	          frank, why don't you and karl go
	          out in the garage and fix him up a
	          place or play a game or somethin'.
	          vaughan, you ready to go?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          sure, i guess.
	
	                    doyle 
	          don't rush ever'body, honey.
	
	she starts to get her things together.
	
	                    linda
	              (to frank)
	          maybe you and karl want to go with
	          us?
	
	                    frank 
	          naw, i don't want to. me and karl
	          got things we need to do.
	
	                    doyle 
	          hey, vaughan, you know what i
	          heard? i heard you been puttin' it
	          to albert sellers that works over
	          at the funeral home.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          i know albert. we're friends.
	
	                    doyle 
	          i heard you was more than friends.
	          i heard dick rivers caught y'all
	          all bowed up and goin' at it in the
	          same room with poor, little, old
	          mizz ogletree and her dead as a
	          doornail layed out on a gurney.
	
	                    vaughan
	          that's ridiculous. that's just a
	          total lie.
	
	                    linda 
	          let's go, vaughan. 
	              (they start for the door)
	          frank, we'll be back in a little
	          while. i'll bring you back
	          somethin'. you're food's in the
	          oven warmin' over.
	
	                    doyle 
	          see, you made him somethin'. hey
	          vaughan, i was just goin' on with
	          you, jokin' around, buddy.
	
	                    vaughan
	              (smiles a little)
	          yeah, i knew that. you're a card
	          all right.
	
	linda kisses frank on the forehead and they leave.
	
	                    doyle
	          so, karl, come have a seat, talk to
	          me.
	
	karl sits on the couch.
	
	                    frank
	          come on, karl, let's go out to the
	          garage.
	
	                    doyle
	          goddamnit, i'm talkin' to the man.
	          you set right there, karl.
	
	frank leans on the sofa arm beside karl.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          what's in your bag?
	
	                    karl
	          this and that. toothpaste and
	          whatnot.
	
	                    doyle
	          what's all them books?
	
	                    karl
	          different ones. the bible's one of
	          'em.
	
	                    doyle
	          you believe in the bible?
	
	                    karl
	          a good deal of it, i reckon. can't
	          understand all of it.
	
	                    doyle 
	          well, i can't understand none of
	          it. this one begat this one and
	          that one begat this one and begat
	          and begat and begat and lo somebody
	          sayeth some shit or another. just
	          how retarded are you?
	
	                    frank 
	          stop it, doyle!
	
	                    doyle 
	          you be quiet, frank, we're talkin'.
	          the adults are talkin'. were you in
	          the lockup for cuttin' somebody up
	          with a hatchet?
	
	                    karl 
	          i ain't never used no hatchet that
	          i remember.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you're just crazy in a retarded
	          kind of way then. 
	              (pause)
	          it wouldn't matter to me if you did
	          do violence on somebody 'cause i
	          ain't afraid of shit. you think i'm
	          afraid for you to stay here. you're
	          just a humped over retard it looks
	          like to me. not really, i'm just
	          jokin' with you. welcome to our
	          humble home, buddy. frank needs all
	          the friends he can get. frank's a
	          real weak little kid. his daddy
	          taught him how to be a pussy.
	
	                    frank 
	          stop it, doyle! don't talk about
	          daddy, you hear me!
	
	                    doyle 
	              (mocking)
	          don't talk about daddy. y'all go on
	          to the garage and let me be.
	
	frank is crying now.
	
	                    frank
	          come on, karl.
	
	they get up and walk away.
	
	                    doyle
	              (yelling to frank)
	          don't tell your mama we had a
	          little spat. she don't need to be
	          worried with your ass.
