	                    bill 
	          karl, see if you can figure out
	          what's wrong with this thing. it
	          won't crank up and ever'thing seems
	          to be put together right.

	          about your boy here, he's doin'
	          good.
	
	karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap.
	
	                    karl 
	          hit ain't got no gas in it.
	
	                    bill

	          thing first.
