	int. vaughan's dining room - night
	
	vaughan, albert the "friend," linda, frank, karl, and
	melinda, the dollar-store girl, are seated at the table. karl
	and frank are going at the delicacies while melinda shyly
	picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat.
	this goes on for a few moments, then albert's attention turns
	to karl.
	
	                    albert 
	          so karl, do you intend to stay in
	          the lawnmower business for a while
	          or do you have other plans?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          i think karl is going to be a
	          writer or a librarian eventually.
	          you should see all the books he
	          has. he must read constantly.
	
	                    karl 
	          i ain't read 'em yet except two or
	          three of 'em. i can't understand a
	          lot of what i try to read. my mind,
	          hit wonders off to somethin' else
	          when i try to read.
	
	                    albert 
	          i'm the same way. of course, in my
	          line of work, i stay too busy to
	          read.
	          but at least i have job security.
	          people may stop doing a lot of
	          things, but one thing is for sure,
	          they won't stop dying.
	
	                    linda
	              (looks at frank)
	          why don't we talk about something a
	          little more festive.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          does everyone like the food?
	
	nods and yeses.
	
	                    vaughan (cont'd)
	          good. i haven't decided yet if i'm
	          a good cook.
	
	                    linda 
	          hey karl, you know what? melinda
	          was voted employee of the month at
	          the dollar store last february.
	          isn't that somethin'?
	
	                    karl 
	          yes ma'am, i reckon.
	
	                    melinda 
	          well, when you like pricing items
	          as much as i do, i guess it's just
	          bound to happen sooner or later.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          karl, maybe you and melinda might
	          want to take a walk or something
	          after dinner. it's a nice night.
	
	                    linda 
	          vaughan, don't get pushy.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          i'm sorry.
	
	                    karl
	          i like walkin' quite a bit from
	          time to time.
	
	                    melinda 
	          i stay on my feet all the time at
	          work. i just can't find shoes
	          that's comfortable.
	
	                    albert 
	          hospital shoes might be the answer.
	          nurses' shoes.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          or the kind old ladies who work in
	          the school cafeteria wear.
	
	                    albert 
	          same difference.
	
	                    melinda 
	          i get real mean when my feet hurt.
	          it's the only time i don't like
	          checkin' out the customers, when my
	          feet hurt.
	
	                    linda 
	          frank, you and karl aren't talkin'
	          much, you boys must really like
	          that food.
	
	                    frank
	          i just don't have anything to say
	          about shoes.
	
	silence for a moment.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          listen everybody, i know this may
	          sound corny, i've had a few glasses
	          of wine and that kind of makes me a
	          little emotional, but i'm going to
	          say it anyway. it just came over me
	          in a rush. i want you all to know
	          that i care about each and every
	          one of you at this table.
	
	                    linda 
	          that's very sweet of you vaughan.
	          we care about you, too. don't we
	          y'all?
	
	nods, grunts, "sure do's."
	
	                    vaughan 
	          also, melinda, please don't tell
	          anybody at the store that albert
	          was here tonight, okay.
	
	                    melinda 
	          why?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          well, a lot of people in town talk
	          and spread cruel rumors.
	          unfortunately, i have to keep
	          certain parts of my life private.
	
	                    melinda
	          you mean about y'all bein' together
	          in "that" way?
	
	                    vaughan 
	          yes.
	
	                    melinda 
	          i think everybody at the store
	          knows that already. they always
	          talk about it. maureen ledbetter
	          told a awful story about why you
	          ain't allowed over at the first
	          baptist church no more.
	
	                    linda 
	          karl, why don't you and melinda go
	          take a walk. it's nice out.
	
	                    karl 
	          all right then.
	
	he gets up and walks toward the front door. melinda gets up
	and tries to catch up.
