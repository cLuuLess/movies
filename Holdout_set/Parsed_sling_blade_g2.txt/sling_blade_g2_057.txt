	ext. residential neighborhood - day
	
	frank, flowers in hand, and karl approach a very nice two
	story house. they get to the door and frank rings the
	doorbell.
	
	                    frank 
	          i always get nervous when i hear
	          that doorbell. i'm okay just
	          walkin' over, but somethin' about
	          that dang doorbell. they have one
	          room where you can't walk on the
	          carpet or sit on the furniture. i
	          don't see much sense in havin' it.
	
	the door opens and we see an older black lady, the
	housekeeper.
	
	                    housekeeper
	              (eyes karl)
	          son, i don't know why you keep
	          comin' over here. you know these
	          folks don't want you here. they run
	          you off ever' time. don't keep
	          doin' this to yourself. you a sweet
	          boy. now go give them flowers to
	          somebody that'll enjoy 'em.
	
	                    frank
	          ma'am, i really want to give them
	          to karen.
	
	                    housekeeper
	              (to karl)
	          you his daddy?
	
	                    karl 
	          no ma'am.
	
	                    housekeeper 
	          well, whoever you are, you ought to
	          talk some sense into him. that
	          little old girl is way too fast for
	          him and don't wanna see him no way.
	
	                    frank 
	          will you get her for me. please. i
	          really want to see her.
	          she'll want to see me, too, 'cause
	          we're not in public. just don't
	          tell her folks i'm here.
	
	                    housekeeper
	              (sighs)
	          okay.
	
	she disappears and a moment later karen appears. she's
	thirteen, pretty and very neatly dressed.
	
	                    karen
	              (put out)
	          hey frank. you shouldn't be coming
	          over here. my parents really don't
	          want you to.
	
	                    frank 
	          i wanted to bring you some flowers.
	          they're pretty good ones.
	
	                    karen 
	          they're from the dollar store. i'm
	          not an idiot. besides we have a
	          garden full of flowers.
	
	she eyes karl.
	
	                    frank 
	          i wanted for you to meet karl, too.
	          he's my new friend. but i feel like
	          i've always known him. i thought
	          you should meet him.
	
	                    karen 
	          why? hi, karl.
	
	                    frank 
	          he's gonna be around a lot and i
	          hope you are too, so...
	
	                    karen 
	          here give me the flowers, i'll do
	          something with them. thank you. now
	          you better go. maybe i'll see you
	          down at the secret place one day in
	          a week or two or something. i have
	          a boyfriend now you know. and we're
	          pretty serious. he gave me a ring.
	
	she proudly displays the ring.
	
	                    frank 
	          can you go there with us now? me
	          and karl. we could just hang out.
	          karl has some cool books.
	
	                    karen 
	          frank, i just like you as a friend.
	          only at the secret place. okay? i
	          can't go there now. i'll see you
	          later.
	
	                    frank
	          but maybe just for awhile -- 
	
	                    karen 
	          i'm closing the door now. i told
	          you, i'll see you later.
	
	she closes the door. they stand therefor a moment, then walk
	away down the sidewalk.
	
	                    frank 
	          she said she'd see me later. that's
	          kinda good, right?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon.
