	int. living room - night
	
	doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
	terence and morris are sitting facing karl and vaughan who
	are on the sofa. randy and the johnson are sitting across the
	room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. they really
	stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
	strewn everywhere. morris is in the middle of a monologue,
	which has obviously been going on for awhile.
	
	                    morris 
	          anyhow i'm not sure if you follow
	          me on those particular points, but
	          it's not really important in the
	          smaller picture, which is where
	          most people dwell anyway. not that
	          being manager of ben's dollar store
	          is insignificant. or that making it
	          through years of incarceration in a
	          state supported facility is any
	          small feat.
	
	                    the johnson 
	          morris, he's the only one in the
	          band that went to college.
	
	                    randy
	          i'm in junior college right now
	          over in westfield.
	
	                    the johnson 
	          that ain't no college, that's trade
	          school. auto repair ain't ever made
	          a genius out of nobody.
	
	                    morris 
	          holidays are for campers.
	
	                    randy 
	          what do you know about bein' a
	          genius, johnson. you can't even
	          hardly keep a steady beat on that
	          high-price drum set.
	
	                    terence 
	          i think y'all play really tight
	          together, randy. y'all shouldn't
	          throw off on one another.
	
	                    morris 
	          anything that has to be discussed
	          can't mean anything.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you got that shit right.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          what exactly do you mean by that? i
	          don't understand.
	
	                    morris
	          exactly the point, my young
	          levelheaded friend.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          i don't get it.
	
	                    morris 
	          i rest my case.
	
	                    terence 
	          morris is real smart with
	          philosophies and things. that's why
	          him and me are the songwriting team
	          of our group. i make up good tunes
	          or melodies as we call them and
	          morris is the lyrics.
	
	                    morris
	          not unlike gary brooker of the
	          protocol harum.
	
	                    randy 
	          we don't ever play any songs that
	          y'all wrote. i never even heard one
	          of 'em. y'all just talk.
	
	                    the johnson 
	          we don't even play any songs with
	          words at all that i remember. we
	          ain't got no fuckin' microphone. or
	          speaker set up.
	
	                    terence
	          we wrote one last night standin'
	          outside mini-mart. morris called it
	          "stuart drives a comfortable car."
	          then, you know, like on country
	          songs in parenthesis it says "there
	          is usually someone in the trunk." i
	          came up with a tune just humming.
	
	                    doyle
	          see vaughan, you shouldn't question
	          a genius. morris is a modern day
	          poet like in the old days.
	
	                    morris 
	          our latest composition is as
	          follows: entitled: 
	          "the thrill" --
	          "i stand on the hill 
	          not for a thrill 
	          but for a breath 
	          of a fresh kill 
	          never mind the man 
	          who contemplates 
	          doing away with license plates 
	          he stands alone anyway 
	          baking the cookies of discontent 
	          by the heat of a laundrymat vent
	          leaving his soul" 
	          (then like in poetry i have dot dot
	          dot then drop down to the next line
	          kind of off center.)
	          "leaving his soul parting waters
	          under the medulla oblongata 
	          of (then dot dot dot again)
	          mankind."
	
	silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
	something other than morris.
	
	                    terence 
	          i don't think that's right. i
	          believe dot dot dot come between
	          medulla and oblongata or something
	          like that. 
	              (morris stares at him)
	          well it did. it wadn't before
	          mankind, i know that much.
	
	                    morris 
	          the dots are where i say they are.
	          melody and tune. that's your trade.
	          you're a tunesmith terence.
	
	                    vaughan
	          i don't really understand the
	          meaning of the words.
	
	                    doyle 
	          if y'all don't shut up i'm gonna go
	          out of my mind. and plus you're
	          liable to bust a spring in karl's
	          head. he's already off balance.
	
	                    terence 
	          that wadn't the way you made it up
	          before, morris. that's all i know.
	
	                    randy 
	          we don't need fancy words, we need
	          to practice. we don't ever
	          rehearse.
	
	                    the johnson 
	          we need some payin' gigs instead of
	          just messin' around on first one
	          patio and then another'n.
	
	                    randy 
	          morris, you should just be the
	          manager, you can't play nothin'
	          anyway.
	
	doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
	window. he has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
	madman in a flash.
	
	                    doyle 
	          we don't have a goddamn band! y'all
	          just shut the fuck up! we don't
	          need no practicin' or managers
	          cause we ain't no fuckin' band!
	          morris ain't no genius and the rest
	          of you are just losers. am i the
	          only one sane human bein' around
	          here? just get the hell out of my
	          house and don't come back!
	
	                    vaughan 
	          it's not your house, doyle, it's
	          linda's.
	
	                    doyle 
	          i'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!
	          you mind your own business. now get
	          out! now, before i get too mad to
	          turn back.
	
	                    terence 
	          what about our instruments?
	
	doyle grabs the handles of terence's wheelchair and pushes
	him right out the screen door. we hear the chair clatter down
	the steps and a cry of pain from terence.
	
	                    doyle 
	          now!
	
	they all file out the door except vaughan and karl who sit
	frozen on the sofa.
	
	                    the johnson
	              (turning back)
	          you ain't right doyle. somethin's
	          wrong with you. nobody needs your
	          shit.
	
	                    morris
	              (stops at the door)
	          the dots just look good on paper.
	          you don't sing 'em anyway. you're
	          showing your true aries colors now.
	
	                    doyle 
	          get out of my goddamn face, you
	          fuckin' buzzard!
	
	he slams the door and turns to see vaughan and karl on the
	sofa and linda and frank, in their nightclothes, standing in
	the doorway.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          i thought i told everybody to get
	          out of my house. that includes
	          cocksuckers and retards. get off
	          your asses and go.
	
	                    linda 
	          this is not your house, doyle. this
	          is my house and i'll say who stays
	          and goes. you've got a house, why
	          don't you go get one of your
	          girlfriends and go home to it.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you know better than to talk like
	          that when i'm hurtin'. don't make
	          me knock the piss out of you.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          doyle, don't you lay one hand on
	          her.
	
	                    doyle 
	          that's funny. 
	              (to linda)
	          you go to bed and take snot nose
	          with you.
	
	linda walks up to him with frank close behind. vaughan gets
	up also. karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.
	
	                    linda 
	          you're not stayin' here tonight. go
	          get sober before you come back. i'm
	          tired of my child seein' this. now
	          you get yourself straight or i'll
	          lock your ass out of my life for
	          good.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you know what i told you, you even
	          think of leavin' me, i'll kill you
	          dead as a doornail.
	
	                    linda 
	          that might be better than this.
	
	                    vaughan
	          i'm a witness. i heard you threaten
	          her life.
	
	                    doyle
	          i thought i told you to keep out!
	
	                    linda
	          leave.
	
	                    doyle
	          don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    linda
	          leave.
	
	                    doyle
	          don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    linda
	          leave.
	
	                    doyle
	          don't tell me what to do.
	
	                    linda
	          leave.
	
	                    doyle
	              (an inch from her face)
	          don't tell me what to do.
	
	she shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
	face. vaughan starts looking for a weapon and frank goes
	wild. he starts throwing anything he can find at doyle. empty
	cans, bottles, a lampstand.
	he connects with an encyclopedia to the head. doyle goes to
	the door. his face has changed from angry to sad, almost
	pitiful.
	
	                    doyle (cont'd)
	          okay, i'll leave and sober up.
	          everything's botherin' me, that's
	          all. i'm hurtin' linda. i love you.
	
	                    frank 
	          i hate you!
	
	                    doyle 
	          well, i hate you, too. no i don't.
	          i love your mama. nobody
	          understands what i go through. i'll
	          leave. you bunch of freaks have
	          fun. i'll call you tomorrow honey.
	          i'm sorry. you can kiss my ass,
	          really. 
	              (to frank)
	          you ever hit me again you little
	          bastard and i'll make you sorry
	          your daddy ever squirted your
	          little ass out.
	
	he leaves and slams the door. frank goes to linda's side, as
	does vaughan.
	
	                    frank 
	          you all right, mama?
	
	                    linda 
	          i'm fine, honey. let's just try and
	          forget about tonight.
	
	                    frank 
	          we don't need to think bad
	          thoughts, do we mama?
	
	                    linda 
	          no, honey, we don't. 
	              (pause)
	          i'll make some coffee and start
	          cleanin' up this mess. karl, you
	          want some coffee, huh?
	
	                    karl 
	          no, ma'am. coffee kindly makes me
	          nervous when i drink it.
	
	                                        dissolve to:
