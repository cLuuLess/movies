	ext. parking lot - day
	
	a man and a teenage boy stand by a pickup truck. a small
	generator is on the tailgate.
	
	                    bill 
	          karl, lift this thing down and
	          carry it to the back. it's on the
	          blink. 
	              (to man as karl unloads
	               it)
	          we'll have it for you in a day or
	          two, walter.
	
	                    walter 
	          y'ont us to he'p you there liftin'
	          that?
	
	                    bill 
	          oh no, that dang karl can lift a
	          bulldozier. fix anything, too. 
	              (confidentially)
	          he's mentally retarded, but he's a
	          whiz on small engines. lord works
	          in mysterious ways.
	
	karl carries the generator toward the shop. he turns and
	watches the man and boy talking and laughing with bill. the
	man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles
	his hair.
	
	                    walter 
	          hell, he didn't just make the team,
	          coach says he's probably gonna
	          start at end on defense. he's a
	          chip off the old block. ain't you,
	          steve?
	
	                    steve 
	          i guess so.
	
	karl turns and goes in the shop.
