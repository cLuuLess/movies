	          i don't know what to tell you. i'm
	          sorry. i made myself pretty clear i
	          thought. he probably got busy and
	          wasn't thinking. i know how that
	          is. i used to teach shop and eighth
	          grade science.
	
	                    marsha 
	          well, what do we do? we drove all
	          the way out here.

	          let's just go, marsha.
	
	                    marsha 
	          no, we have to get this story.
	
	                    theresa 
	          i thought you'd be happy to leave.
	
	                    marsha 
	          why won't he talk to women?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          he has problems. you know. with all
	          that. he won't hardly talk to
	          anybody really. just certain
	          people. he's very troubled.
