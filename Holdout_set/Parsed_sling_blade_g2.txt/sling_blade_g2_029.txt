	int. fixit shop - day
	
	two men, bill cox, a large man in his forties, and scooter
	hodges, a really country-looking guy in his thirties, look up
	from behind the counter as woolridge and karl enter.
	woolridge goes to the counter, karl stands by the door
	looking at the floor.
	
	                    bill 
	          hey jerry, how it's goin'. good to
	          see you. been a long time.
	
	                    woolridge
	          good to see you, bill. how's
	          everybody doin'?
	
	                    bill 
	          aw, pretty good. kids are drivin'
	          me crazy and phyliss is gonna put
	          me in the poorhouse. can't complain
	          other than that. wouldn't do any
	          good if i did. 
	              (laughs)
	          do you know scooter, jerry?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          no, don't guess i do. 
	              (he shakes hands with
	               scooter who sort of
	               smiles)
	          scooter, good to meet you. 
	              (woolridge leans in and
	               gets confidential)
	          this is him, the one i talked to
	          you about on the phone. now like i
	          said, i'll understand if you get
	          nervous about it. i'm not gonna lie
	          to you now, he did get in that
	          trouble but then he was real young.
	
	                    bill 
	          i remember it real well. cut them
	          folks to pieces. his mama one of
	          'em.
	
	                    scooter 
	          and that ol' dixon boy. hell, i
	          always wanted to kill him myself.
	          asshole's what he was. i remember
	          that ol' boy 
	              (points to karl)
	          too. kind of retarded or somethin'
	          back in school.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          well, he seems pretty well-adjusted
	          these days. i don't think he'd ever
	          hurt anybody.
	
	                    bill 
	          don't look much like he could. you
	          say he can fix a small engine like
	          nobody's bidness.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          he's a regular whiz at it. that's
	          all he did when he was a kid.
	
	                    bill 
	          well, i ain't scared of him workin'
	          here. you know me. i'm a church
	          goin' man. forgivin' man. when your
	          time's up the lord's gonna come git
	          you. you seared of him, scooter?
	
	                    scooter 
	          i don't guess. can he talk?
	
	                    woolridge 
	          oh yeah. listen i really appreciate
	          it. he needs the job. i don't know
	          what to do with him. he don't have
	          anybody really.
	
	                    bill 
	          that old man of his still livin'
	          over there on clark street i
	          believe.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          he won't have anything to do with
	          him. now you say it's all right for
	          him to stay out here in the back?
	
	                    bill 
	          fine with me. if he steals
	          anything, i'll take it out of your
	          pocket anyway.
	
	bill slaps woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with
	laughter.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          he won't steal. i'm tellin' you
	          he's a pretty good ol' boy. keeps
	          to himself.
	
	                    bill 
	          well, i've got a roomful of work
	          for him to do. can't get scooter to
	          do any of it.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          karl, come over here. i want you to
	          meet your new boss. 
	              (karl obediently shuffles
	               over)
	          this is bill cox, runs this place.
	          says you can work here and stay in
	          the back.
	
	                    bill 
	          good to know you, karl.
	
	                    karl 
	          thank ye.
	
	                    bill 
	          now it's minimal wage and there
	          ain't nothin' but a army cot and a
	          toilet back there.
	
	karl doesn't say anything.
	
	                    woolridge 
	          that'll be fine. karl, i'll go to
	          the car and get your books.
	
	woolridge exits. bill and scooter just stare at karl and karl
	stares at the floor.
	
	                    bill 
	          they say you're a whiz on fixin'
	          lawn mowers and things.
	
	                    karl
	          i've tinkered around on 'em a
	          little bit.
	
	                    bill 
	          we order from dairy queen at
	          noontime usually. we can buy your
	          lunch till you get on your feet a
	          little.
	
	                    karl
	          i like them french-fried potaters.
	
	                    bill 
	              (long pause)
	          yeah, me too.
	
	                    scooter
	          they make a good double meat
	          burger.
