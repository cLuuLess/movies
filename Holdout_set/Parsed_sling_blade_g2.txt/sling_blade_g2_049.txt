	int. kitchen - night
	
	linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and
	sits at the table. after a moment, she looks up and is
	startled to see karl in the doorway.
	
	                    linda 
	          you scared me.
	
	                    karl 
	          i didn't aim to.
	
	                    linda 
	          want to sit down? did you need
	          somethin'?
	
	                    karl 
	          no ma'am.
	
	karl just keeps standing there and linda keeps staring.
	
	                    karl (cont'd)
	          two fellers was on a bridge a
	          takin' a leak and one feller says
	          the water was cold and the other
	          said it was deep water. one of 'em
	          came from arkansas, i believe.
	
	                    linda
	              (puzzled)
	          i'll be dog.
	
	more silence.
	
	                    karl 
	          do you reckon you can make me some
	          biscuits?
	
	                    linda 
	          right now?
	
	                    karl 
	          just whenever you take a notion to.
	          i don't aim to put you out.
	
	                    linda 
	          well, it is nearly breakfast time
	          anyway. i can't go to sleep. i have
	          to be at work in three hours. you
	          know how it is when you just sleep
	          an hour or two, you feel worse than
	          if you hadn't slept at all?
	
	                    karl 
	          yes ma'am.
	
	                    linda 
	          well, set down and i'll make some
	          biscuits and gravy.
	
	                    karl 
	          mustard's good on 'em to me.
	
	                    linda 
	          okay.
	
	karl sets at the table and linda starts to make the biscuits.
	
	                    karl 
	          thank ye.
	
	                    linda 
	          it's all right. 
	              (pause)
	          you know i was thinkin' there's
	          this girl that works with me. she's
	          real heavy, but she's cute in the
	          face. well, you know, she's slow.
	          she's a little bit, i think. she's
	          not retarded, just -- it don't
	          matter, listen to me. i thought you
	          might like to meet her. vaughan
	          wants to have a little supper over
	          at his house and we could invite
	          her. would you like that?
	
	                    karl 
	          i wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
	
	                    linda 
	          vaughan's "friend" will be there,
	          too. he works at the funeral home.
	          and frank. you know frank likes you
	          a lot. he says you make him feel
	          calm.
	
	                    karl 
	          i like frank. he's a good boy. me
	          and him's made friends.
	
	she keeps working.
	
	                    karl (cont'd)
	          hit ain't right for me to keep from
	          tellin' you how come me to be put
	          in the state hospital.
	
	                    linda 
	          that's okay. it's not really my
	          business. i have wondered though.
	          why was it? was it like a nervous
	          breakdown?
	
	                    karl 
	          i killed my mother and a old boy
	          name jesse dixon. i thought they
	          was a-doin' wrong. i was about your
	          boy's age. they say i'm well now
	          from it.
	
	linda stops working and turns to karl, a little shocked, but
	not as much as you would think.
	
	                    linda 
	          was that you? i remember that. i
	          was only three or four, but i
	          always heard about it growin' up. 
	              (pause)
	          they say you're well?
	
	                    karl 
	          yes ma'am. 
	              (pause)
	          i like your garage. 
	              (pause)
	          i wouldn't never hurt you or your
	          boy. i'd lay my hand on the bible
	          and say the same thing.
	
	                    linda 
	          i believe you. i really do.
