	                    linda
	          how come karl won't eat here with
	          us?
	
	                    frank
	          i don't know. he just said he'd eat
	          out there.
	
	                    doyle
	          well, i wouldn't let it get to you.
	
	                    linda
	          i just feel sorry for the poor
	          thing.
	
	                    doyle
	          who could eat with him settin'
	          there makin' that goddamn racket
	          with his throat.
	
	                    linda
	          he does make some funny noises.
	
	                    frank
	          i sure like the way he talks. it
	          sounds like a race car motor
	          idlin'. it makes me not be nervous.
	
	                    linda
	          i'm glad of it, honey.
	
	                    doyle 
	          what have you got to be nervous
	          about? you're a damn kid. you ain't
	          got any bills to pay or bidness to
	          run or old lady to stay on your ass
	          all the time.
	
	                    frank 
	          i get nervous, that's all i know.
	
	they eat in silence for a while. linda and frank know where
	this conversation could lead and know when to leave well
	enough alone.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you know what, by god?
	
	                    linda 
	          what?
	
	                    doyle 
	          you know what we ought to do
	          tonight?
	
	                    linda 
	          please doyle, don't.
	
	                    doyle 
	          have a damn party! call morris and
	          them and get the band together and
	          just party our asses off. i'd like
	          to show that fuckin' karl to the
	          guys. they'd get a kick out of
	          that. don't you know they would.
	
	                    linda 
	          please don't. not tonight. i'm not
	          up for it. they always stay till
	          mornin'. i'm just give out, doyle.
	
	                    doyle 
	          you don't have to do anything but
	          pour some potato chips in a bowl
	          and bring beers out when we get
	          low.
	
	                    frank 
	          last time you got mad and run
	          morris and them off and said to
	          stay away from here.
	
	                    doyle 
	          that ain't none of your damn
	          bidness. besides that's the way
	          friends do one another. fuck it,
	          i'm gonna go call 'em. honey, find
	          my guitar, i think it's out there
	          in the garage with that loony tune.
