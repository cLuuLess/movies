	ext. wooded area - late afternoon
	
	karl and frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying
	the spoils of their ben's dollar store visit.
	
	                    frank 
	          this is what i call my secret place
	          'cause i come out here when i feel
	          like bein' by myself. i used to
	          come here with karen cross. she's
	          kind of like my girlfriend, or used
	          to be. she says she likes jerry
	          maroney now. but i'm gonna get her
	          back 'cause i love her. we used to
	          come here and hold hands and talk
	          and read books to each other with a
	          flashlight. she didn't want to have
	          anything to do with me in front of
	          other people 'cause i don't have
	          any money. well, mama and me, i
	          mean. she seemed to like me a whole
	          lot when we were out here though.
	          she said she loved me, too. out
	          here. settin' right on that stump
	          you're on. see, her daddy's a
	          dentist so they're rich. so's jerry
	          maroney's daddy. he owns the ice
	          plant. was your folks well off?
	
	                    karl 
	          naw. didn't have too much. enough
	          to scrape by on, i reckon.
	
	                    frank 
	          they still around, your folks?
	
	                    karl 
	          my mother's dead. my daddy's
	          s'posed to be around still. he
	          don't want to have nothin' to do
	          with me though.
	
	                    frank 
	          how do you know?
	
	                    karl 
	          he never did want to. i figure he
	          ain't changed his mind much.
	
	                    frank 
	          how did your mama die?
	
	                    karl
	              (long pause)
	          you don't need to know all of that.
	          you're just a boy.
	          you need to think about good
	          thoughts while you're still a boy.
	          they'll be plenty of time for the
	          other.
	
	                    frank 
	          i've had a lot of bad thoughts
	          since my daddy died. sometimes i
	          wish i was still real little and he
	          was still here. my mama's real
	          good, but i wish i had both of 'em. 
	              (pause)
	          when we went to memphis one time in
	          the car, it was rainin' so hard we
	          couldn't see the road. but i wadn't
	          scared because i thought as long as
	          daddy was drivin' nothin' could
	          happen to us. i feel that way about
	          mama now. 
	              (he looks at the ground
	               for a moment)
	          mama has a boyfriend now. his name
	          is doyle hargraves. he works
	          construction so he makes a pretty
	          good livin'. he still don't help
	          mama out with any money though. he
	          ain't no good. he's mean to her. he
	          don't like me at all. mama says
	          it's because he's jealous i belong
	          to my daddy instead of him. he
	          stays with us all night sometimes,
	          but he's got his own house.
	          somebody told me it's so he can
	          still have other girlfriends. i
	          like it on the nights when he ain't
	          at our house. i'm not so nervous
	          then.
	
	                    karl 
	          how come her to keep bein'
	          girlfriends and all with him if
	          he's mean to her?
	
	                    frank 
	          she says it's for the times when
	          he's good to her. she's lonely
	          since daddy died. she said
	          sometimes she don't know why. 
	              (pause)
	          he threatened to kill her if she
	          ever left him. my daddy would kill
	          him if he was here and somebody was
	          mean to mama. vaughan, he's real
	          good to mama. vaughan that you met.
	          but he's not able to do anything to
	          doyle, he's funny you know. not
	          funny ha, ha, funny queer. he likes
	          to go with men instead of women.
	          that makes him not to be able to
	          fight too good. he sure is nice
	          though. he's from st. louis. people
	          who are queer can get along better
	          in a big town. he got transferred
	          here to work. but mama said the
	          real reason he left is 'cause his
	          daddy hated him. for bein' the way
	          he is. i wish he liked to go with
	          women. i'd rather him be mama's
	          boyfriend than doyle.
	
	pause as frank looks at the ground again. he seems troubled.
	
	                    frank (cont'd)
	          karl. 
	              (pause)
	          you know when i said daddy got hit
	          by a train.
	
	                    karl
	          yeah, i remember you a-tellin' me
	          that.
	
	                    frank 
	          it ain't the truth. he shot hisself
	          with a shotgun on purpose.
	
	                    karl 
	          why did he do that, reckon.
	
	                    frank 
	          'cause he didn't have enough money
	          to take care of us the way he
	          wanted to. that's what the letter
	          said. he got laid off from work and
	          had to just work odd jobs. i
	          thought he took care of us fine. 
	              (pause)
	          karl, did you really kill somebody?
	
	                    karl 
	          yeah, i did.
	
	                    frank 
	          who did you kill?
	
	                    karl 
	          two people.
	
	                    frank 
	          were they bad people?
	
	                    karl 
	          i thought they was.
	
	                    frank 
	          maybe they needed it.
	
	                    karl 
	          i growed up and got taught it ain't
	          right to kill nobody.
	
	                    frank 
	          it's okay if you're lookin' out for
	          yourself. if it's self-defense. was
	          it self-defense?
	
	karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and
	doesn't answer.
	
	                    frank (cont'd)
	          my daddy was good. i think too many
	          good people die. it ain't right.
	          that's what i think.
