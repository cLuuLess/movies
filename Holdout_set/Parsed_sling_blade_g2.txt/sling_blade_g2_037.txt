	ext. porch - night
	
	karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books
	staring at the door. after a moment, we hear a car door slam
	and footsteps on the porch. then we hear vaughan's voice.
	
	                    vaughan
	          karl?
	
	karl turns to face vaughan.
	
	                    karl
	          yes sir.
	
	                    vaughan
	          so, you're really going to stay
	          here?
	
	                    karl
	          that boy wants me to.
	
	                    vaughan
	          did you knock on the door yet?
	
	                    karl
	          naw, i ain't.
	
	                    vaughan
	          how long have you been standing
	          here?
	
	                    karl
	          quite a spell, i reckon.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          listen, before you get very used to
	          staying here, i think you and i
	          need to talk about a few things.
	          can i take you to lunch?
	
	                    karl 
	          i done et just a little bit ago.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          i mean tomorrow or the next day.
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon i can stand to eat a
	          little somethin' or 'nother at
	          noontime tomorrow. bill cox
	          generally gets me a box of french
	          fried potaters. but i reckon he can
	          lay off doin' it tomorrow.
	
	                    vaughan
	          okay, i'll come by mr. cox's and
	          get you at noon.
	
	they stand therefor a moment. vaughan doesn't really know
	exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. after a
	moment, frank answers the door.
	
	                    frank 
	          hey. y'all come on in.
