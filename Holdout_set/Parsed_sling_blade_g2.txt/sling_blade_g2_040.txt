	int. hamburger establishment - day
	
	vaughan is carrying a tray of food as karl follows him to a
	table and they sit and immediately start to eat. after a few
	bites, vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          okay, karl, the reason i brought
	          you here was to talk to you about
	          something that is on my mind. 
	              (pauses for a response,
	               instead karl eats french
	               fries and stares at the
	               table)
	          i guess i'll put it right out on
	          the table. where do i start. linda
	          and frank are very important to me.
	          they're like family. my own family
	          was never like family. they're
	          horrible people. as a matter of
	          fact i prayed every night for years
	          that my father would die. i finally
	          realized through a lot of therapy
	          that i was wasting my energy on
	          hating him. now i just don't care. 
	              (pause)
	          you see, you and i are a lot alike,
	          strange as that may seem. i mean
	          not physically or even mentally
	          really, just well, maybe
	          emotionally or actually the hand
	          we've been dealt in life. we're
	          different. people see us as being
	          different anyway. you're -- well
	          you have your affliction or
	          whatever and i, well mine's not as
	          easy to see. i'm just going to say
	          it. i'm gay. 
	              (watts)
	          does that surprise you? 
	              (watts)
	          that i'm gay. you know what being
	          gay is, don't you?
	
	                    karl 
	          i reckon not.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          homosexual. i like men. sexually.
	
	                    karl 
	          not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          well that's a very offensive way to
	          put it. you shouldn't say that. you
	          were taught that, weren't you?
	
	                    karl 
	          i've heard it said that way.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          anyway, it's hard to live gay,
	          that's the right way to say it, in
	          a small town like this. i've wanted
	          to leave many times, but my love
	          for linda and frank and another
	          certain person that we won't go
	          into have kept me from it. anyway,
	          i'm rambling. if you're going to
	          live in the wheatly garage you need
	          to know that it won't be easy.
	          doyle is a monster. not just a
	          closed minded redneck, but a
	          monster. a dangerous person. i've
	          told linda that one day that man is
	          going to really hurt her or that
	          boy. maybe even kill one of them. i
	          see it in his eyes. i'm very in
	          tune, maybe even psychic. doyle
	          will make your life hell. you're a
	          perfect target. when i first saw
	          you i was afraid of you. not really
	          afraid, i guess, just taken aback.
	          but also, i felt a real sensitive
	          feeling from you. and for some
	          reason, frank has adopted you. much
	          like a stray animal. i'm sorry, i
	          didn't mean it like that. in a good
	          way. anyway, i just want you to
	          know what you're in for. i have a
	          good feeling about you. you're good
	          for frank. maybe it's that he can
	          have an adult friend on a child's
	          level.
	          i'm sorry, i didn't mean it in a
	          bad way.
	              (pause)
	          there's one more thing. it's none
	          of my business why you were in the
	          state hospital. everyone has
	          something in their past, maybe you
	          tried suicide, maybe you did
	          something -- terrible. but what i
	          see before me is a gentle, simple
	          man. all i want you to promise me
	          is that you're capable of being
	          around linda and frank. you know.
	          you would never hurt them under any
	          circumstances, would you?
	
	                    karl 
	          i wouldn't never hurt them.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          that's what i thought. i hope i
	          haven't offended you in any way.
	          you seem like a thinker. you seem
	          to always be in deep thought. tell
	          me something. what are you thinking
	          right now?
	
	karl looks up and stares for a moment.
	
	                    karl 
	          i was thinkin' i could use me
	          another helpin' of these potaters.
	
	                    vaughan 
	          oh. how about before that?
	
	                    karl 
	          before that i was thinkin' it'd be
	          good if i could get another three
	          or four cans of that potted meat if
	          you got any extry.
