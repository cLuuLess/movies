	              (takes a drink of coffee)
	          i don't think he's talked to a
	          woman in twenty-five or so years.
	          that i know of anyway. that's why i
	          said to send a man. at least maybe
	          he'd answer a question or two for a
	          man. i'm all for helping the
	          college out, believe me. it might
	          be a real good article or story.
	
	                    marsha 
	          can't you talk to him? maybe talk
	          him into it. i'm a real good
	          interviewer. just get me in the
	          room with him.
