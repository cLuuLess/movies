          while walt fills a bird feeder, he notices tao next door.
          tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          walt shakes his head and walks over to tao.

          walt
          hey, moron.
          tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.

          tao
          what?

          walt
          i appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person i know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.

          tao
          what now?

          walt
          you don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black power line is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.

          walt
          go grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and i'll show you how to
          do it right, zipper head.
