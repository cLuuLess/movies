          tao and sue arrive just as smokie, spider and company are
          being driven away in police cars.
          tao looks at smokie in the squad car. smokie no longer
          looks tough or hard, he just looks scared.
          on the street, walt is being bagged by the ambulance
          crew. father janovich prays over him.
          tao steps up to a police officer.

          tao

          tao turns to the hmong police officer.

          tao
          what happened, man?
          the hmong police officer looks at the white police
          officer and then to tao.

          hmong police officer

          (subtitled)
          the old guy reaches for a lighter
          and they gunned him down. the
          gang said the old guy was here to
          kill them, but he didn't have a
          weapon.
