          had plenty to drink at the vfw.

          the dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. walt looks at
          the clock; it's 3:48 am.
          walt looks out his bedroom window. he sees the faint
          beam of a flashlight in his garage.

          walt
          son of a bitch.
          walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
          the big, 30-06 m1 garand rifle he took home from korea.
          walt slides a magazine into the top of the m1 and
          chambers a round with a loud snap.
