          ummmm... i'll have a gin and
          tonic.

          the waitress leaves.

          walt
          so, what do you want?

          father janovich
          i promised your wife i'd get you
          to go to confession.

          walt
          jesus christ, why'd you do that?

          father janovich
          she was very insistent. she made
          me.

          walt
          you sure are fond of promising
          people stuff you can't deliver on.

          father janovich
          let's talk about something else.

          walt
          like what?

          father janovich
          life and death.

          walt
          what would you know about it?

          father janovich
          i'd like to think i know a lot.
          i'm a priest.

          walt
          you stand at the altar and preach
          on and on about life and death
          without knowing anything other
          than what you learned in priest
          school. everything you say sounds
          like it's out of the rookie
          preachers handbook.

          father janovich
          i don't know about that...

          walt waves his hand and cuts him off.

          walt
          Â‘death is bittersweet? bitter in
          the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
          that's what you know of life and
          death? good god, it's pathetic.

          father janovich
          what do you know, mr. kowalski?

          walt
          plenty. i lived with death for
          three years in korea. we shot
          people, we stabbed them with
          bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
          old kids to death with shovels,
          for christ's sake. i did things
          that won't leave me till the day i
          die, horrible things, things i
          have to live with.

          father janovich
          and what about life?
          walt has to think for a second. he struggles with his
          answer.

          walt
          well... i survived the war... got
          married... and raised a family.

          father janovich
          sounds like you know more about
          death than you do living.
          walt downs a shot.

          walt
          maybe so.
