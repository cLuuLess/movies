          the ceiling fan and faucet are taken apart on the
          workbench. walt reinstalls the diverter valve. tao
          looks at all of walt's tools.

          tao
          man, where did you get all this
          stuff?

          walt
          what are you talking about?

          tao
          all the tools and stuff.

          walt
          where the hell do you think i got
          them, toad? this may come as a
          shock to a thief, but i actually
          bought the things i have with
          money i earned.

          tao
          yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what
          i meant. there's just so much
          shit packed in here.

          walt
          you need the right tool for the
          right job. every single thing
          here has a purpose.

          tao
          okay, what's this?
          tao points to a tool.

          walt
          post hole digger.
          tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
          succession, questioning walt with his expression.

          walt
          hand spade. tin snips. nail
          punch. tack hammer. putty knife.
          wire stripper. drywall saw. tile
          spacers.
          silence. walt can see something is bothering tao, but
          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --

          walt
          what?

          tao
          i can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.

          walt
          i didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. i've lived here
          for fifty years. a man stays in
          one place long enough he tends to
          attract a decent set of tools.

          tao
          yeah, but...

          walt
          look, kid, i think i know where
          you're going with this. you don't
          need everything to maintain a
          house. i'm going to let you in on
          a little secret.
          walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down three
          items in quick succession.

          walt
          this is for you. roll of duct
          tape, can of wd-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. any man who's worth a
          shit can do half his household
          jobs with these three things. in
          the odd chance that doesn't work
          out, you can borrow something.

          tao
          okay. cool.
          walt coughs and covers his mouth. both tao and walt see
          the spot of blood in his hand.

          tao
          what's with that?

          walt
          what's with what?

          tao
          the blood you just coughed up.
          that's not good, you should see a
          doctor.
          walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the
          screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.

          walt
          so... what exactly was the deal
          with those guys out on my lawn
          that night? who are they?

          tao
          a gang. hmong gangbangers.

          walt
          i gathered that. what did they
          want with you?

          tao
          they wanted to take me away
          because i blew my first
          initiation.

          walt
          you joined up with those pukes?
          damn, you are a pussy. why in the
          hell did you do that?

          tao
          i don't know. they were
          persuasive. my cousin's in the
          gang. they just talked me into it
          i guess.

          walt
          well, at least you're honest about
          it.
          a long silence. walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.

          walt
          so how'd you blow your first
          initiation?
          tao nods towards the gran torino.

          walt
          the gran torino?
          tao nods. walt laughs.

          walt
          christ all friday.
