          the tricked-out honda drives up, but doesn't stop at
          walt's. it pulls up in front of tao's house. tao and
          sue exchange looks out on the front step.
          smokie, spider and two others get out, walking
          confidently up the sidewalk towards them. they grin,
          they're cocky.

          spider
          hey, cuz. what's up?

          tao
          what are you doing here?

          spider
          be happy. we've got good news.

          sue
          oh really? what's that?

          smokie
          we're giving you another shot.

          tao
          i don't think so.

          smokie
          you blew it the first time. we've
          got another little inauguration
          planned for you. this time
          there'll be no mistakes.

          sue
          another big, tough gangbanger with
          Â‘little-man' complex.
          smokie leers at sue. it makes her uncomfortable.

          smokie
          i got my eye on you too, little
          girl.

          sue
          whatever.

          smokie
          come on, tao. let's go.
          tao says nothing. he looks at the ground.

          spider
          he said, let's go.

          smokie
          come on, man. nobody's gonna get
          hurt. we'll take care of you.

          sue
          don't go, tao.

          smokie
          you mind your own business, girl.
          two hmong gangbangers grab tao by the arms.
          the front door swings open and there stands a glaring
          phong.

          phong

          (subtitled)
          leave my grandson alone!

          26.

          i know what you are. go away and
          don't come back.

          smokie
          that old woman's got bigger balls
          than you. you always let little
          girls and old ladies fight for
          you?
          tao tries to squirm away. smokie grabs him by the hair
          and opens his coat to reveal the pistol in his belt.

          smokie
          i'm not gonna say it again. let's
          go. now.
          tao is shoved towards the car.
          suddenly -- sue jumps on the back of one of the
          gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. tao breaks
          free.

          sue
          run, tao, run!
          sue is slapped to the ground.

          sue

          run!!
          tao is tackled by smokie and punched in the face. tao's
          mother comes out the front door.
          smokie and spider pull tao towards the car as the other
          gangbangers keep mom, grandma and sue at bay.
          a middle-aged hmong man from across the street comes into
          the yard. all the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. the middle-aged hmong man gets in spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          tao back-pedals away from spider and smokie. it becomes
          a pushing, rolling, surging melee.
          this mess boils over and spills into walt's front yard.
