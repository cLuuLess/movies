          walt straps an old westinghouse freezer onto a two-
          wheeled dolly. walt attempts to pull the freezer
          upstairs.
          walt strains with the heavy appliance. it's too much
          weight for walt, but this doesn't stop him from heaving
          and pulling.
          walt could have done this by himself when he was younger.
          walt sits down on the step and breathes hard.
