          mitch and karen storm out to their land cruiser. mitch
          carries the gopher grabber tool and karen has the big
          numbered phone in her hand.

          mitch
          i told you, i told you this was a
          bad idea.

          karen
          i know, you were right.

          mitch
          son of a bitch! he just won't let
          anyone help him.

          karen
          well, we tried. now we can just
          drop it. no one can say we didn't
          try.

          mitch
          to hell with him, kicking us out
          on his birthday?! we should've
          stayed home with ashley and josh.
          they knew better, they wouldn't
          even come. the goddamned kids are
          smarter than we are!
          mitch screeches the tires as they take off. walt waits
          for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch
          with a can of pabst.
          daisy comes out and lies at his feet.
          walt covers his mouth as he coughs. a dime-sized circle
          of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand.
          walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer.
