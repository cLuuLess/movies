          walt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds.
          walt goes from room to room, from vu to phong finally to
          tao -- making sure no one's been hit.

          walt
          is everyone okay? is anyone hit?
          sue? vu? tao, where's tao?
          tao sits up from behind the couch. blood pours down his
          neck. he's stunned.

          walt
          oh no.
          walt lays tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt.
          walt probes around tao's neck.

          tao
          what... what is it?

          walt
          hang on... you're just cut, is
          all.

          tao
          is everybody else okay?

          walt
          yeah.
          walt looks around at the bullet holes in the walls. tao
          follows his gaze.

          tao
          it's a miracle no one was killed.

          walt
          they aimed high.
          sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head
          level on the walls.

          walt
          where's sue?

          tao
          she went to our aunt's.

          walt
          call her.

          tao
          what?

          walt
          i said call her. get the
          goddamned phone and call and see
          if she's there.
          tao scrambles for the phone and dials.
          tao speaks hmong to whomever answered. tao starts to
          speak faster. he looks at walt and shakes his head no.
          for once -- vu and phong understand what walt was talking
          about. there is anguish on every face in the room.
