          walt pulls up in his pickup truck. sue and vu wait on
          walt's porch. tao stands out on the sidewalk.
          walt gets out of his pickup.

          walt
          what now? what?
          vu rambles on in hmong. walt looks at his watch. he
          looks at sue for the translation.

          sue
          tao is here to make amends, he's
          here to work for you.

          walt
          no he's not.

          sue
          mother says that tao dishonored
          the family and now he has to work
          off his debt. he'll start
          tomorrow morning.

          walt
          no. the kid is useless, i don't
          even want him on my property. i
          thought we already went over that.

          sue
          it's very important to my mother
          that you accept. it'd be an
          insult to refuse.

          walt
          how is this all of a sudden turned
          around on me? the goddamned kid
          tries to steal my car and somehow
          i'm the bad guy if i don't accept?

          sue
          my family is very traditional and
          it will very much upset them if
          you don't let tao repay...
          tao interrupts from the sidewalk...

          tao
          come on, sue. if he doesn't want
          to, let's just go.
          sue and vu yell at tao to shut up at the same time; sue
          in english, vu in hmong.

          sue/vu
          shut up. shut up! shut up!!
          tao looks at the ground.
          a pause. walt sees the earnest looks on the hmong
          women's faces. their expression begs walt.
          walt gazes back at tao. walt looks disgusted, he exhales
          loudly...

          walt
          fine. great. tomorrow.
          walt walks past them and into his house.

          walt
          jesus, joseph and mary. these
          hmong broads are like badgers.
