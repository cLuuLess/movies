          vu, sue, tao and wa xam all sit in lawn chairs, talking
          and laughing. walt flips the inch-thick steaks on his
          weber.

          walt
          how do you want your dog... i mean
          steaks cooked? medium, medium
          well?

          tao
          funny.
          walt pops open a beer and grabs an appetizer that vu
          made.

          walt
          is this hmoog or laab?

          sue
          laab.

          walt
          isn't it usually a little spicier?
          tao, wa xam and sue laugh.

          sue
          oh whatever, wally.

          walt
          it does. usually it's got more
          zing.

          sue
          jesus christ, look at you. i've
          never seen you like this.

          walt
          what?

          94.

          sue
          look at you smile, old man.
          kicking back, having a good old
          time. you're sure pleased with
          yourself today.

          tao
          and it's a little unnerving if you
          ask me.

          walt
          aw, go on.

          sue
          no, admit it. you are. you're
          feeling pretty good, aren't you?

          walt
          well, who wouldn't? i'm
          surrounded by beautiful women,
          it's a beautiful day. great food,
          good friends. hell, even toad
          isn't driving me nuts for once.

          tao
          it never ends.

          walt
          i'm just kidding. let me tell you
          something, yum-yum. if tao
          doesn't ask you out soon, i will.

          sue
          don't listen to him, wa xam. he's
          a white devil.

          wa xam

          (laughs)
          i'd love to, walt, but he beat you
          to it.

          walt
          i'll be damned. movie? dinner?
          wa xam and tao nod. they're a bit embarrassed.

          sue
          yeah, they're taking the bus.

          walt
          the bus?! that's no good. a
          charming young lady like this
          deserves to go in style.

          tao
          like what? take a limo?
          walt nods towards the gran torino.

          tao
          the gran torino? you'd let me
          drive it?

          walt
          sure. why not.

          tao
          really?
          walt smiles.

          walt
          really.
          they shake hands.
