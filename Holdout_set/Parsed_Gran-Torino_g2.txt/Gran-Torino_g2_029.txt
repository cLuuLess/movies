          the gangbangers, tao, his mother, grandmother and sue all
          struggle on walt's painstakingly maintained lawn.
          a ceramic lawn gnome is knocked over and breaks.

          and before anyone can blink, walt has the muzzle of his
          big 30-06 m1 garand rifle pointing at smokie's face.

          walt
          get off my lawn.

          smokie
          listen, old man, you don't want...

          walt
          i said get off my lawn. now.
          walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
          the guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big
          military rifle walt holds.

          smokie
          are you fucking crazy? go back in
          your house, old man.

          walt
          get off my lawn.

          smokie
          i'm not fucking around, gramps.
          walt spits out the side of his mouth. he grins.

          walt
          don't think for a second i won't
          blow a big hole in your face and
          it won't bother me a bit, not any
          more than if i shot a deer. now
          get off my goddamned lawn.
          two of the hmong gangbangers take a step back. walt
          senses their fear. only smokie holds his ground.

          walt
          believe me, kid, i'll blow your
          damn head off, go back to bed and
          sleep like a baby. i couldn't
          care less.

          smokie
          i'm not gonna warn you again!
          walt laughs...

          walt
          you're nothing to me. in korea,
          we stacked fucks like you five
          feet high and used you as
          sandbags.

          complete silence, there's no sound anywhere in the
          neighborhood. all eyes are on walt.
          walt clicks off the safety on the m1 garand rifle.
          smokie and the gangbangers give walt fierce looks, but
          melt back towards their car.
          as they get into the car -- smokie has to say something.

          smokie
          you better watch yourself, old
          man.
          the honda screeches its tires and goes off down the
          street.
          walt looks at tao, sue, mom and grandma who stand in
          stunned silence in his front yard.
          a pause. finally, sue speaks up...

          sue
          thank you.
          walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground.

          walt
          i said get off my lawn.
