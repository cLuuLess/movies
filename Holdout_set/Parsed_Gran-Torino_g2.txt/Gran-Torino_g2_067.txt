          tao looks on as walt turns the faucet on and off, it
          drips water at its base. walt looks under the sink.

          walt
          for the love of pete.

          tao
          what?

          walt
          it must be a hundred degrees in
          here, turn on the fan.
          tao flips the switch on the ceiling fan, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.
          walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.
