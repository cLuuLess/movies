          mitch and karen sit across from walt. a small store-
          bought birthday cake sits in front of walt.
          walt reads his birthday card. it's signed; love mitch,
          karen, ashley and josh. all the signatures have been
          written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
          mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to walt.

          mitch
          go ahead, dad. open it.

          walt
          what is it?

          mitch
          just open it.
          walt opens the package, it's a gopher reaching tool --
          the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
          objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
          walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.

          mitch
          it's a gopher. it's so you can
          reach stuff. you know, it makes
          things easier.

          karen
          here's one from me.
          karen slides over a another wrapped gift. walt opens it.
          it's a phone with really big numbers for old people.

          42.

          karen
          it's a phone.

          walt

          (emotionlessly)
          thank you, karen.

          karen
          i just thought... we thought that
          it would... make things easier.

          walt
          yeah, i see that.

          karen
          there's nothing wrong with making
          things less hard on yourself.

          mitch
          karen's right, dad. you've worked
          hard your whole life. maybe you
          should think about taking it a
          little easier?
          walt lights up a cigarette.

          mitch
          and that's another thing, dad.
          you should get rid of the coffin
          nails.
          walt says nothing.

          mitch
          and the house, now that mom's
          gone, it's got to be a lot to
          maintain, let alone clean... and
          you're all alone in here.
          it's worse than walt thought. he puffs smoke.

          karen
          there's these great places now,
          these communities where you don't
          have to worry about mowing the
          lawn or shoveling snow. people
          who are like you, alert, active,
          but are alone and would benefit by
          being with other folks their own
          age.

          pamphlets.
