          walt walks out his front door with daisy on her leash.
          he walks over to tao's house.
          phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at walt. she yells
          in hmong as walt walks straight up to her.

          walt
          aw, pipe down, you hag.

          phong

          (subtitled)
          you're an evil man. i've seen
          your kind before. back home,
          white soldiers came to our
          villages and filled our young
          men's minds with ideas of glory.
          then you'd lead them away to their
          deaths.
          walt, of course, has no idea what she said.

          walt
          fine, i hate you too.

          walt holds out the dog leash to phong. she looks down at
          daisy and back at walt. she lashes out again in hmong.

          walt
          i need you to watch my dog.
          walt holds the leash closer. phong folds her arms in
          defiance. walt exhales loudly.
          walt lifts up one of the legs of her lawnchair and slips
          the loop of the leash underneath it so daisy can't follow
          him.

          walt
          her name is daisy.
          walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets daisy. he
          scratches her belly.

          walt
          you take it easy, old gal. you
          good old girl.
          walt gets up and walks away without looking back.
          phong is stunned; she is silent for once.
