          sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed.

          sue
          hello?

          walt (v.o.)
          it's walt. the key to my front
          door is under the ceramic turtle.
          open the door and go let your
          brother out of the cellar. i have
          to go.
          the line goes dead as walt hangs up. sue jumps up out of
          bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs.
          phong blocks her path. phong grabs sue by the arms.

          (subtitled)
          who was that? where are you
          going? you tell me what's going
          on?!
          sue squirms away from phong and runs outside. on her way
          over to walt's house, she sees daisy leashed to phong's
          chair. it scares sue even more.
