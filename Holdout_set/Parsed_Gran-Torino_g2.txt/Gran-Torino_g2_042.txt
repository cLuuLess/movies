          inside are thirty hmong and walt, who sticks out like a
          sore thumb. total fish out of water.
          walt looks in the refrigerator, sue looks over his
          shoulder.

          walt
          you do have a lot of beer, but no
          pabst.

          sue
          as they say, when in hmong.

          walt
          ha ha. are you sure it's okay i'm
          here? everyone keeps looking at
          me and when i look back, they look
          at the ground.

          sue
          it's fine.
          phong appears from the crowd and points at walt.

          (to sue)
          what is he doing here?
          walt cringes at her presence.

          walt
          what'd she say?

          sue
          she said welcome to our home.

          walt
          no she didn't.

          sue
          no, she didn't.

          why is this white man in our home?
          a man like him brings nothing,
          nothing but sorrow and death.
          several relatives usher phong away from walt. the
          relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.

          walt
          she hates me.

          sue
          yes, she hates you.

          walt
          what did i do?
          a little hmong girl walks past and walt pats her on the
          head. everyone in the room looks in horror at walt.

          walt
          what?! what the hell are all you
          fish heads looking at?!
          sue looks around and then pulls walt out of the room.

          sue
          maybe we should go in the other
          room.
