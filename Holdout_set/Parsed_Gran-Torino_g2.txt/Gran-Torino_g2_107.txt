          walt and company...

          walt
          anybody got a light? no? i got
          one.
          walt's slight grin fades. he mutters to himself...

          walt
          hail mary, full of grace.
          walt reaches into his coat pocket. six hmong gangbangers
          simultaneously level their pistols and fire.
          bullets fly. walt is struck down. people scream.
          walt falls dead. a zippo lighter clutched in his hand.
          walt never intended to kill anyone. self-sacrifice.
