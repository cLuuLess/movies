          epiphany.
          walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands.
          he's still pale. he looks long and hard in the mirror.
          walt is stunned, it all adds up. walt hasn't really
          lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let
          his guard down since he got back from korea in 1953.

          (to himself)
          son of a bitch. i've got more in
          common with these goddamned gooks
          than my own spoiled-rotten family.

          happy birthday.
          walt opens the bathroom door. sue stands there with a
          concerned look on her face.

          sue
          are you okay?

          walt
          me? i'm fine.

          sue
          you were bleeding?
          walt smiles disarmingly.

          walt
          i just bit my tongue. i'm fine.
          i'm great. let's get some of that
          gook food, i'm starving.
