          walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair
          and cries. he tries to stop and cries harder.
          it's the first time walt has cried in fifty years. he
          wails, crying for tao, sue, his wife, kids and himself.
          he lets it all out. daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs
          his old dog as he bawls.
