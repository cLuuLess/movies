          the light flips on and before he can blink, tao is face
          to face with the barrel of walt's m1 rifle.
          walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. as tao backs
          up, walt advances, step for step.
          tao trips over a garden hose, which causes walt to trip.
          they both start to fall. the lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          as walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally fires the
          rifle. the bullet goes through a big, metal hamm's beer
          sign on the wall.
          tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          walt. tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. sweat runs
          down his forehead. he coughs up blood. the lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.

          walt
          shit.
