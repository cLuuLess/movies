          walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash.
          he dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the
          hmongs. his garbage is overflowing.
          coming down the alley is another hmong couple, they smile
          carrying a basket filled with asian vegetables.
          walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.

          walt
          no. no more.
          the hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn
          around.

          next door
          tao, his mother and sue argue in the yard. they gesture
          towards walt's house. the women buzz around tao, all
          speaking in his ear at the same time.
          phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her.
          walt watches as the mother and sue march tao towards his
          house. tao looks like a whipped dog.

          walt
          why won't these people leave me
          alone?
          walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
          up his hands, indicating they've come far enough.
          sue holds up a plant.

          sue
          we brought you some shallots to
          plant in your garden.

          walt
          i don't want them.

          sue
          they're perennials, they come back
          every year.

          walt
          no. you keep them. why do you
          people keep giving me all this
          garbage?
          sue is a little taken aback.

          30.

          sue
          because... because you saved tao.

          walt
          no, i didn't. all i did was get a
          bunch of jabbering gooks off my
          lawn.

          sue
          well, you're a hero to the
          neighborhood.

          walt
          no, i'm not.

          sue
          too bad, they think you are and
          that's why they're bringing you
          the gifts.

          walt
          just take your plant and leave me
          alone.
          walt turns and starts to walk away.
          tao's mother speaks rapidly in hmong to sue. they look
          at tao and then to walt.

          sue
          there's another thing.

          walt
          what?

          sue
          this is my mother, vu, i'm sue and
          this is my brother, tao. we live
          next door.

          walt
          so?

          sue
          tao is here to apologize.
          sue shoots a hard look at tao, who shifts uncomfortably.

          tao
          i'm sorry.

          walt
          for what?

          31.

          tao
          for trying to steal your car.
          walt's eyes go wide in recognition. he turns white with
          rage.

          walt
          get this straight, i see you on my
          property again, you're done.
          walt turns on his heels and storms into his house.
