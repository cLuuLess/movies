          87
          walt pulls up his driveway and parks. daisy jumps out
          and walt carries his rifle into the house. walt walks
          stiffly.
          walt gets to the door and drops his keys. when he bends
          down to pick them up, you can really tell he's sore and
          hurting.
          walt groans as he goes inside. he's feeling his age.
