          walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just
          cleaned and oiled. tao comes in and looks down at the
          two weapons --
          the 30-06 m1 garand rifle and the colt .45 pistol.
          tao picks up the heavy rifle.

          tao
          which one do i get?

          walt
          you ever fire a weapon?

          tao
          no.
          tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target.

          walt
          put that down. i got something
          for you.

          tao
          what?

          walt
          in korea, october, 1952. we were
          sent up to sweep a chink machine
          gun nest that had carved us up
          pretty bad. i was the only one
          who came back... i received the
          silver star. i want you to have
          it.

          tao
          why?

          walt
          when we went up that hill, we knew
          it was ten to one against us, but
          we went anyway. this trouble now,
          it's similar. we're walking right
          into it. we might not be coming
          home tonight.

          tao
          the hell we won't. we're going to
          roll in there and tear ass.

          walt
          don't be a fool, these guys are
          waiting for that exact reaction.
          tao is quiet for a minute.

          tao
          how many?

          walt
          how many what?

          tao
          how many men did you kill in
          korea?

          walt
          thirteen for sure. probably more.

          107.

          tao
          what was it like to kill a man?

          walt
          you don't want to know.

          tao
          why not?

          walt
          go get the silver star. it's in a
          blue wooden box in the cellar.
          tao goes downstairs. he turns on the light and goes into
          the cellar. tao locates a blue wooden box and opens it.
          tao holds up the medal. he looks at it closely.
          and wham -- walt slams the heavy cellar door shut behind
          him. walt slides the bolt lock into place with a loud

          click.
          tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. of
          course he tries anyway. tao is furious. he throws
          things.

          tao
          what the hell are you doing?! let
          me out of here, you goddamned son-
          of-a-bitch!!

          walt
          quit smashing everything. you'll
          never get out of there, so just
          relax.

          tao
          you let me out, you crazy old
          fuck, or i will kill you when i
          get out of here.
          tao pounds on the door. walt pounds back with a strength
          and authority which startles tao.

          walt
          you want to know how it feels to
          kill a man? it feels goddamned
          lousy. and it feels even worse
          when you get a medal for bravery
          right after you mowed down some
          scared kid when he tries to give
          up. a dumb, scared, little gook,
          just about your age. i shot him
          with the same rifle you just held
          upstairs.

          i've thought about that kid for
          fifty years. and i promise you,
          boy, you want no part of it. me,
          i've got blood on my hands. i'm
          soiled. forgive me for tricking
          you like a dope. i'll call
          someone and have them let you out
          later.

          tao
          no! let me out!!
          tao pounds on the door.

          walt
          you've come a long way. i'm proud
          to call you a friend. you have
          your whole life ahead of you,
          whereas this is what i do. i
          finish things. you'd just get in
          the way. sorry.
          walt goes back upstairs, leaving tao locked up in his
          cellar.
          tao howls to be let out.
