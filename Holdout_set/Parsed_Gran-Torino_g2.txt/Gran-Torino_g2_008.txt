          people are leaving walt's house. a mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old pollacks.
          right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more hmong going up the sidewalk. they laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. they are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting walt's home.
          the hmong are going to a birth ceremony. a three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.

          cut to:

          another angle
          walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. he hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          mitch, karen, ashley and josh pull up next to walt in a
          brand new toyota land cruiser. mitch opens the window.

          mitch
          i'd really like to help, dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          walt just looks at the toyota emblem on the land cruiser
          and then gives mitch a disgusted glance.

          walt
          fine. go.

          mitch
          i'll call in a few, see how you're
          doing.
          walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.

          walt
          kill you to buy american.
