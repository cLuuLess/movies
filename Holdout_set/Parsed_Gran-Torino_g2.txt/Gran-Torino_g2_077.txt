          if you do this, you're going to
          follow through, right?

          tao
          yeah, yeah.

          walt
          no, not yeah, yeah. yes, as in
          yes, sir, i'll do my best.

          tao
          yes, i'll do my best.

          walt
          you better, because when i vouch
          for someone, it's my word and i
          don't want anyone making me look
          bad.

          tao
          no, i'm good. i'm totally into
          this.

          walt
          and don't lay down to people all
          the time. always look a person in
          the eye. when you shake a man's
          hand, you can usually tell where
          you stand with him.
          walt hands a pair of beat-up work gloves to tao.

          walt
          here, stuff these in your back
          pocket.

          tao
          cool.

          walt
          just don't blow this.
