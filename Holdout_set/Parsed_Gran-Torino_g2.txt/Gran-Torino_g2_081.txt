          tao gets off the bus, his tool belt over his shoulder.
          tao looks tired after working, but content. he walks
          past an abandoned lot.
          the tricked-out honda pulls up and stops. smokie, spider
          and company get out. tao looks nervous, but remains
          calm.

          tao
          what now?

          spider
          just seeing what you're up to,
          cuz.

          tao
          i'm getting home from work, not
          that you guys would know much
          about that.

          spider
          so it's true? you got a job.

          tao
          come on, what do you guys want
          with me?

          smokie
          jesus christ, tao. what do you
          think? i've been sooooo easy on
          you, but i can't just go on like
          nothing happened.

          tao
          you can't just leave me alone?

          smokie
          afraid not.
          the gangbangers grab tao. tao kicks and struggles as
          they yank away his tool belt.

          tao
          keep your hands off my stuff.

          smokie
          your stuff? you and everything
          you have is mine. i own you.
          smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
          against the pavement. whatever tools smokie can't
          destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.

          smokie
          you can't just walk away from us,
          tao. it looks bad. it makes me
          look bad.
          smokie lights a cigarette and exhales...

          smokie
          what's the phrase i'm looking for?
          oh yeah, i need to Â‘save face.'
          smokie grabs tao by the neck and presses the lit
          cigarette into tao's cheek.
          tao screams as his flesh burns.

          90.
