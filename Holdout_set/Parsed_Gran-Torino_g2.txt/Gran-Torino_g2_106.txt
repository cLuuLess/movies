          sue opens the front door, runs to the stairwell and
          pounds down the stairs.

          sue
          tao? tao, are you alright?

          tao (o.s.)

          i'm down here! let me out!!
          she unlocks the cellar door. tao comes out in a rage.

          tao
          goddamn it!

          sue
          what's going on?

          tao
          he left without me!

          sue
          where? where'd he go?!

          tao
          he went to smokie's without me.
          tao takes the stairs two steps at a time.

          sue
          no! no, tao!
          sue grabs tao's legs and hangs on.

          sue
          no! don't you dare! stay away
          from them, tao! i don't want
          anyone else getting hurt.

          tao
          leave me alone.

          sue

          no, tao. no!
          they struggle at the top of the stairs and spill into the
          kitchen floor. tao runs for the door when something
          catches his eye...
          the kitchen table.
          the rifle and pistol are still there.
          walt purposely left the guns at home.

          tao
          oh god! no!!
