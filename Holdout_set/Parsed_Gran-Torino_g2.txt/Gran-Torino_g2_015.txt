          rings; daisy doesn't even move. walt walks to the front
          door holding a roll of duct tape. the doorbell rings
          again.

          jesus christ, dog, have you gone
          totally deaf?
          walt opens the door. standing on his front step is
          father janovich.

          father janovich
          hi there, walt.

          walt
          listen, son, you're not my barber,
          you're not a friend, so why in the
          hell do you think you can call me
          walt?

          father janovich
          sorry... mr. kowalski.

          walt
          so, what are you peddling now?

          father janovich
          oh, nothing. thought i'd drop by
          and see how you were doing.
          haven't seen you in church in
          awhile.

          walt
          okay. you've done your good deed,
          now why don't you run along.

          father janovich
          i'd really like to talk, mr.
          kowalski.

          walt
          i don't think so, kid. sorry.

          father janovich
          why? do you have a problem with
          me, mr. kowalski?

          walt
          you don't want to know.

          father janovich
          no, i do.

          walt
          the problem is i think you're an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who holds the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promises them eternity.
