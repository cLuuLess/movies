          mitch watches afternoon baseball, drinking an imported,
          bottled beer. karen pokes her head into the room.

          karen
          see you later, i'm taking the kids
          to the mall.
          mitch never looks up from the tv.

          mitch
          yeah, fine. just don't spend too
          much goddamned money.

          karen

          we hear karen and the kids exit.

          mitch

          to myself for once.
          the phone rings. mitch looks at the caller id. it says;
          dad. mitch almost doesn't pick it up...

          the camera intercuts between walt in his small kitchen
          and mitch in his huge den.

          well... i... um... i'm getting the
          old westinghouse up out of the
