          walt sits in the dark, the only light is from the radio
          tuned to baseball. daisy lies in the front seat. next
          to daisy is the m1 rifle.
          walt watches as spider and another hmong gangbanger step
          out of the rundown duplex, get in their honda and drive
          off.

          walt
          that's the last of them.
          walt pulls out his colt .45 automatic and chambers a
          round.
