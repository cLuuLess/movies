          that thing weighs a ton.

          walt
          yeah, but it runs like new. they
          don't make them like that anymore.

          tao
          what are you going to do with it?

          walt
          sell it. i haven't used it in
          years and it was always in the way
          down there.

          tao
          how much?

          oh, i don't know. sixty bucks,
          maybe. why, you need a freezer?
