          walt sits across from tao, drinking rice liquor. walt
          speaks loudly, without any consideration for phong who
          shoots him dirty looks.

          walt
          this is exactly what i didn't
          want. damn gooks. why the hell
          am i even here?

          tao
          maybe one of her friends called
          and she just changed plans.
          walt sips the rice liquor. walt now speaks quietly to
          tao.

          walt
          in korea i learned not to care.
          the best friends of my life are
          still missing somewhere in korea.
          you harden yourself. don't let
          anything get to you.
          phong looks out the window and screams. she runs over
          and swings open the door.
          everyone expects the worst...
          and it comes like a cold wind -- sue walks in like a
          zombie. she has been brutally beaten. her clothes are
          dirty and torn.
          blood runs down sue's legs from under her shirt.
          walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand.
          sue staggers into vu's arms. vu weeps. sue hugs her
          mother and sobs.
          tao reaches to hug his sister, but phong screeches at
          him, pointing at walt and back to tao.
          walt is destroyed. he steps outside into the dark.
